"Sleepin_Dragon","14 January 2023","Where to even begin.... I don't make out to be a historian, but I take a keen interest in this time period, it's a fascinating, horrendous era, this .... doesn't give any historical fact or detail, it's basically a shoot 'em up movie which happens to be set during The Second World War.It surprises me that they didn't have someone beating Hitler up, uppercutting Goebbels in a bunker action sequence.The Second World War, Hollywood style, some white amazing looking action sequences throughout, it's incredibly atmospheric, you can almost smell the gunpowder and feel the tension.I hate myself for saying it, but I love this film, it's Brad Pitt and Shia laBeouf both absolutely nailing it.If you watch any reviews, or read many of the written reviews, you'd come away thinking this film wasn't worth your time, my advice would be to try it, but know what you're getting.It's absurd, but it's so enjoyable.8/10.","

"OzMovieWatcher","18 July 2020","The goofs and historical inaccuracies are everywhere in this movie. War historian Youtubers pick this movie to pieces. As they should. The inaccuracies and goofs are overwhelming for anyone with an ounce of WW2 military history knowledge.
As a military historian myself, I spotted errors within the first 5 minutes, BUT, I enjoyed this movie. It is WW2 war movie entertainment only. Military historians go to ton on this movie/... the inaccuracies are overwhelming... but it is a damn fine movie. The acting is superb. Fantastic film work, and what id o personally like is the German Tiger tank in the movie, is an actual German Tiger tank being the only fully functional restored Tiger in the world.","

"bkoganbing","28 December 2014","Fury has Brad Pitt starring as a battle hardened tank commander in those last days before VE Day. Russians to the east, Americans, British, Canadians and assorted other allies invading the Third Reich that was supposed to last for a thousand years. These were the last bitter days of the war when what was on the west were kids and die-hard S. S. troops.While the Russians were facing a desperate resistance from the German Army because Germans in general knew what to expect from the avenging Russian bear, the western front had everyone surrendering or trying to cut deals for themselves. Not so the S. S. troops, Hitler's elite. And those we kill.In those last days Pitt gets a new replacement, a clerk typist suddenly drafted into the tank corps. It was Logan Lerman's misfortune to miss the end of the war in Europe by only a few weeks. He has a really bad time of it with Pitt and his crew, but eventually gets into the savage spirit of impatience for these men who just want these people to surrender and get it over.In the end Pitt gets what could be a last stand mission, hold a vital checkpoint crossroads to prevent a Nazi counterattack.Pitt and his soldiers are not from Hollywood World War II era films. They are a savage crew. But heroism sometimes can just be a case of\ opportunity.There might be an Oscar in the offing for Pitt and Lerman. Both are incredibly good and incredibly dynamic. The battle special effects are first rate. It's one unvarnished view of World War 2's final days.","

"bradykitchen-33648","21 December 2023","Alright so my immediate reaction after this movie ended was holy crap that was good. I was in literal awe of the films ability to portray the brutality of war and how when it's all set and done it's not a bunch of medals and celebrations. When it's done it's grief and despair and trauma after everything that just happened. They show how this affects people, how it turns good people bad and forces them to become something they're not. Then I went online and read a few things that said that they didn't care about the characters cause they were ""bad people"". In my opinion those people completely missed the mark of the film.This isn't a war film where you're supposed to like the characters. This is a war film that shows what war does to people, and what you have to become to survive it. Logan Lerman is the perfect example of that. His character Norman comes in as this scared shitless angel kid who's never done a wrong thing in his life. But over the course of the movie he sees what happens in war and how brutal it is and eventually becomes cold hearted and ruthless. That is what this film is. This isn't a ""let's root for these lead characters because they're the heroes"" film, this is a brutal telling of what actually happened during those wars and what it did to people.The other big criticism I saw was how bad of a person Jon Bernthals character was. That was the point, everyone handles killing people over and over differently, they need to trick themselves into believing they are the kind of person who does. That's what Bernthals character is.On a more technical note this film is almost flawless. Acting is across the board phenomenal, action sequences are stunning, music is perfect, story is top notch. I don't have anything negative to say her. Just incredible.","

"quincytheodore","29 October 2014","Strikingly far from mainstream war movie, Fury is unapologetically messy and brutal. The crude nature affects more than the visual, with the cast uttering unrefined profanity along with some military jargon. While the cinematography is splendid, it's nothing near the glossy or cinematic flair of other war movies, such as Saving Private Ryan, this is am unfiltered portrayal of war. It goes out of its way to display the gritty, sometimes intentionally overlooked aspect of war, the entire dirty ugliness of it.Brad Pitt as Wardaddy provides a solid leader persona. He's as consistent as he could be, and with the experience of war movie under his other belt, albeit a rather different one, it comes as no surprise that he performs amazingly. It's not a macho leader character as Wardaddy occasionally has doubt, mostly heavily suppressed. Shia LaBeouf as Bible is good, displaying better on-screen flair than most of his recent ones. Michael Peña as Gordo and Jon Bernthal as Coon-Ass (classy name) round up the crew.Peña works well, delivering a couple of good scene when least expected. Bernthal from Walking Dead has a certain niche, as an ally who sometimes looks like about to snap. Perhaps the highlight of Fury is Logan Lerman as Norman, the newly recruited crew. He's suddenly thrust into battle at its bloodiest. He gradually trades his innocence with experience of the horrid war out of necessity. Screenplay and dialogues are great, using direct, occasionally rude approach. The characters sound and act like soldiers, and it's not the usual presentable ones for cinema screen.What gives it more depth is how it's rooted on military. From inside of the tank or down time between skirmishes, every bit seems realistic. The strategy is sound, thus giving more weight to action sequences. This one is not for the fainthearted however, as limbs will fly or get chopped off clean. The movies doesn't dwell on particular gore for shock purpose, it simply brushes fatal graphic and burning bodies as if they are normal occurrences. Soundtracks are effective as well. While most tunes are subtle or orchestra for tense scenes, a few hymns, as if chanted by the soldiers themselves, are eerily moving.If there' are some minor complains of the movie, it's that the plot progresses in predictable way and the action in darker scenes are murky. Fury is a straightforward ride into the center of war. It's a less flamboyant, certainly not romanticized, but a damn fine one.","

"bob-the-movie-man","23 October 2014","I can't make my mind up about ""Fury"". As an escapist war film, it delivers well in a clichéd sort of way. But is it a true reflection on what the latter stages of WW2 were actually like? I doubt it. This film certainly doesn't paint American soldiers in a good light, although after slogging their way across Europe for months on end, facing sense-numbing death and destruction on a daily basis, perhaps it is a realistic portrayal? I just don't know, and would be interested to hear the views of any veterans who were there.In many of the classic war films of the 50's and 60's, such as ""The Longest Day"" or ""The Great Escape"", when people were shot they just threw their arms in the air and fell down: sanitised death – – ""war is hell"", but let's not show it on screen. Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" rather changed all of that, with 15 minutes of the most visceral footage seen to date, which even D-Day veterans agreed was frighteningly realistic. Spielberg followed that with the remarkable ""Band of Brothers"", with some of the scenes – notably those in the Belgium forest – showing a realistic level of violence but more importantly bringing home the true mental anguish of war. Brad Pitt in (and on) Fury David Ayer's ""Fury"" differs from this masterpiece in two notable ways: firstly, the 'Tarentino effect' seems to have been brought into play with a level of violence and gore that seems to have gone over the top: heads fly off and faces come off with gay abandon; secondly, the US tank crew at the heart of the film seem to be so cold and brutal that you care very little about what happens to them – cracks in the hardened shell of Brad Pitt's character are not referenced again or followed through satisfactorily. Even the rookie crew member (a very good Logan Lerman) turns from pacifist shirker to hardened nut-job faster than you can say ""Dead Nazi"". As such, your emotional attachment to him gets severed pretty early on (in fact this is such an unbelievable transition that a ""1 month later"" subtitle could have been judiciously added at this point).The tightly knit tank crew (Pitt, Lerman, Shia LaBeouf, Michael Peña, Jon Berthal) all spark off each other well, with LaBeouf as the bible-quoting Boyd Swan being particularly memorable.The gorgeously vulnerable Alicia von Rittberg plays Emma as the one and only love interest in the film: and for once, Brad Pitt doesn't get the girl! This tense encounter is one of the best dramatic moments in the film. And Harry Potter's Jason Isaacs also delivers a great cameo as a scarred and embattled Captain Waggoner.In terms of the film-making, it is an effectively put together film by David Ayer (""Training Day"", ""The Fast and the Furious"") who also wrote the film. Real life tanks, from Dorset's Bovington Tank Museum, were used with South Oxfordshire standing in for rural Germany. The 'Zulu-style' climax is tense albeit very far fetched, with German's conveniently choosing to regroup and think about it for a few minutes while dramatic and more reflective moments go on inside the tank.Music is by Steven Price (his first film score following his Oscar success with ""Gravity"") is effective – mixing electronica, orchestral and choral to good effect in the more dramatic scenes.All in all, an enjoyable if rather gory romp with some memorable scenes that stick in the mind after the lights come on. If you watch blood and gore films with your hands over your eyes, this is one you might want to miss: your viewing time will be severely limited! Certainly not as bad as it could have been, but more and better character development could have perhaps turned this from a good war film into a great war film.(If you enjoyed this review, please sign up to receive my future posts at bob-the-movie-man.com.

"richard-543-683365","12 July 2015","Reviewer after reviewer criticizes this movie for its phony depictions of the war, clichés and unrealistic battle scenes. There is only one significant fact that is crucial to know when it comes to the accuracy of the depiction; Shermans were going to be your coffin in a face-off with a Tiger. If you want serious historical detail then consider watching a WWII documentary. I think the overall depictions were secondary and only serve as the backdrop for the director's real message which was the painful slow process of the relationship that was built between these guys in a tragic situation. I think Ayers did a masterful job at this. You think Brad Pitt is a second rate actor? Watch his facial expressions during the scenes in the room with Logan Lerman and the 2 women; Watch his nervous breakdowns. Watch him in the ""Why are you such an asshole?"" scene. Watch him as he jokes with his guys about Hitler and chocolate bars. Even with Wardaddy's personal weaknesses, by the middle of the movie you understand why these guys liked, admired and respected him, and I'll bet you do also. His timing and delivery, in my opinion, are better than Tom Hanks on this best day. Watch LaBoeuf's nervous leg, and a list of other endearing nuanced details; He plays a very convincing religious proselytizer. During the tank battle if you didn't feel like your life was threatened then you were probably on xanex. I'm not sure that there is another film that conveys this kind of claustrophobic camaraderie from a tank crew's viewpoint. If there is, I've never seen it.","

"RatedVforVinny","9 September 2020","This film let itself down in the end but was the first U.S war film Iv'e ever seen depicting the reality, that American soldiers were mostly mopping up Hitler Youth fanatics. Also showing that U.S troops were capable of atrocities, just like any other combatant (from other nations). The best part of the movie was seeing a real legendary Tiger Tank in Action. The one that is used in this movie (the only working one in the World), is Tiger 131 (housed at Bovington Tank Museum). Obviously in real warfare it would have smashed those American tanks to a zillion pieces. The ratio of Tiger to Sherman K.O's is 14 to 1. One Tiger knocked out 50 T-34's on the Eastern Front. The ending is the most fantastical war scene I ever seen. All of a sudden 'Fury' turns into Star Wars but way less believable. How do 100's of Waffen SS soldiers fail to beat a a severely crippled tank. It's highly unlikely that they would have been there at the end of the war (singing along a road). The SS committed beastly war crimes (true) but they were also crack combat troopers. My 10 year old boy stated the pure obvious.! ""Why the hell did they not fire the boxes of 'Panzerfausts' they had at hand!"" I'm sure everyone apart from the Director, was thinking the very same absurdity. Still there is more to like than dislike, so settling on a 7 rating.","

"trublu215","15 October 2014","Fury pits a tank filled with five American soldiers at the tail end of World War II as they struggle to fight off a small army of Nazi soldiers that are closing in on them. David Ayer directs this brutal and grim war film with no romance to it. Ayer's film is grim, bloody and unrelenting and fully captures the absolutely horrific nature of war. Brad Pitt's Wardaddy is far from Lt. Aldo Raine in Inglorious Basterds, he is a man who is truly run ragged by this war. So much so that it is all the character knows. Followed by his brigade of miserable men played by the likes of Michael Peña, Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman and Jon Bernthal, Fury depicts not only the atrocities of war but the ideology of brotherhood with this film. Each of these actors, especially LaBeouf, give their all in roles that are merely supporting on paper. Ayer has an extremely keen eye for chemistry on screen and he directs each of these actors to deliver performances that are well beyond anything that could be scripted. These men truly feel as if they are brothers in arms and you buy into every second of it. The film on a technical level is terrific. Ayer ditches his hand held method for still shots and dolly rigs and it pays off ten fold. The film is visually stunning, a pure grit to the desaturated frame is present from start to finish. As I touched on before, Fury is a violent war film much so in the vein of Saving Private Ryan and Lone Survivor. You are subjected to every bullet wound, every explosion of sharp shrapnel, every wound with the utmost visceral imagery. It is disturbing yet necessary for a film like this. Deapite these dark tones and brutality, Fury does feature lighter moments especially with Logan Lerman who gives a seemingly bare-bones performance as Norman Ellison that is subtle but extremely effective as he slowly becomes desensitized to all the violence around him. His performance is constantly evolving along with his character, letting us see layer after layer until he comes full circle in a bloody final act. The best way to describe Fury is by comparing it to Wolfgang Peterson's Das Boot just with a tank instead of a submarine. Its claustrophobic, up close and personal, making the scenes of harrowing violence even more effective. Overall, Fury is a brutal war film that shows war exactly how it should be shown. Its disturbing, its violent, its scary. Fury really hits a home run between the sweeping cinematography, the phenomenal performances and the near perfect direction, it is one hell of a film that shouldn't be missed.","

"Reviewer99","4 June 2020","Exciting, well filmed, good acting, but the plot had holes. The major one being the ending. You do not stand and fight at your crippled tank. You take what you need from the tank, booby trap it, then retreat back to your lines while booby trapping the route of the advancing enemy.In the movie Platoon the soldiers had to stand and fight because they had nowhere to retreat to. That ending worked.And what's with the tank hitting a mine along a pristine country road with no signs of battle anywhere in the vicinity. Or the singing Nazi soldiers marching in unison in this countryside setting too.Oh the shark jumps ...","

"film316-125-427677","30 November 2014","People seem to think that war films are pretty hot right now, but they aren't. Having my ear so close to cinema I know for sure that there is always one or two war films floating around in the projection booths, but people are making somewhat of a big deal out of Fury, so I suppose the reel question is will this be a Flag For Our Fathers or will it make us wish for Apocalypse Now?So lets get this out of the way now. Fury isn't as good as Saving Private Ryan, but then I don't think it ever meant to be, comparing the two movies is like saying that Saun Of The Dead isn't as good as The Book Of Eli, just because both films has similarities (in as much as they are set at the end of the world) doesn't mean they are anything alike. These are two films that are near logger heads with each other.You see Fury is contained, and given an almost claustrophobic feel to it, the entire film is either inside or at close proximity of the tank that Collier commands. This gives the movie a focus, and a focal point. We are never given a rest from the tank and it's enforcing nature, we are given no repreave from it, just like the men themselves, we are trapped in a steel giant that is only purpose is to kill people.To say that Fury is bloodthirsty would be an understatement, actually that's not fair for me to say. Fury doesn't enjoy itself in gore, it only tries to give us an accurate portrayal of what it must have been like for those brave men and women who faced death on a daily basis.That's what David Ayer does really well, he controls his audience. In the opening scene we are shown Collier (Brad Pitt) ambushing and attacking a German officer, it is crude and desperate and over quickly but we can tell even then that is a man who cannot cope with the horrors he has had to endure.Looking back there are so many moments in Fury that stand out as impressive. There is a single second where Collier shows his true emotions and it is incredible to view. Collier is a man who is forced to be a hero, he never chooses it, he wants only to survive this war.Any war film can be impressive in it's action sequences, anyone can make loud noises and explosions and fighting, but if a war film can still shock and grip and captivate you in the slower periods, in the silences, that's when you know for sure you have an outstanding movie, and that is what happens with Fury.Like all war movies, Fury ultimately builds to a climatic finale and truly I think it's one of the best I've ever seen, not because of the action or it's quality of visuals but because we have invested too much into the characters we have seen on screen.The film of course would be nothing without the men inside the tank, those being Brad Pitt (who helms the best), Shia LaBouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal. With these men there is no star, or main character, outside the tank the two leads are Logan Lerman (Who plays the new recruit) and Brad Pitt, however once we are inside the tank all men are equals, and dare I say it, but Shai LaBouf is actually quite good in his role. It's also always nice to see Jason Issacs on screen (hello to you).Fury is a poignant and painful reminder of how much war can take from each of us, it is a film that never wants us to relax and we never do. Gory and gripping, Fury deserves a high spot in the history of war movies.","

"claudio_carvalho","19 October 2015","In 1945, in the World War II in Germany, the tough Sergeant Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt) commands a tank and survives to a German attack with his veteran crew composed by Boyd 'Bible' Swan (Shia LaBeouf), Trini 'Gordo' Garcia (Michael Peña) and Grady 'Coon-Ass' Travis (Jon Bernthal). He receives the rookie soldier Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) as the substitute for his deceased gunner and he tries to harden the youth along the battles. ""Fury"" is a war film with despicable characters and ridiculous situation in a stupid and unrealistic conclusion. The boastful nationalism of the writer and director David Ayer is laughable and the final scene with the five American soldiers fighting against hundreds German soldiers with a damaged tank is hilarious. However the production is careful in details. The execution of the German soldier and the behavior of Don's soldiers in the house of the German ladies is something that unfortunately happened during the occupation of Germany. However they are not shown in most of the American films that usually blame Russian soldiers only for rape and violence against civilian population and German soldiers for war crimes. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Corações de Ferro"" (""Iron Hearts"")","

"barjo-915-203229","26 October 2014","OK, lets face it. We are over movies where one American kills 20 Germans who seemingly can't hit the wall of a Barn. They were big in the 1950's, and 1970s, but not any longer.Fury is a gritty film, with great productions values, really period vehicles, settings and costume. The acting is good, but it is let down by tow things.Clichéd characters. There is the tough commander, the new kid, the slightly crazy guy. There are a lot of clichéd characters here.Unrealistic battle scenes. Seriously I just switched off in the last scene. 20 or 30 SS guys with Panzerfasut would have destroyed an immobilied Sherman tank in 5 or 6 minutes. BUT 200 CRACK SS soldiers can't destroy a tank with its tracks off, sitting in the middle of a road????? The tank only has machine guns facing forward, so most of its sides are unprotected. Germans are carrying bazookas, but instead choose to shoot the tank with machine guns, which would not do anything? Seriously, one of the silliest, most unrealistic scenes in any war movie. Really spoilt what could have been a good movie.","

"CalRhys","4 November 2014","I can gladly say that David Ayer's World War II flick 'Fury' lived up to my expectations. The audience are confronted with the horrors of war, accompanied with some truly spectacular well-crafted battle scenes that proves Ayer's desire to create something new and profound. Ayer keeps the gritty realism he employed on his other acclaimed films only this time uses it to depict the journey of a tank crew in Germany in 1945. The performances are strong from Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman and even Shia LaBeouf has proved he has a hidden acting talent after his heyday on the set of 'Transformers'. An emotional war-drama that packs a punch with visceral action scenes and an atmospheric score, definitely worth a watch.","

"niteliterr","1 December 2014","When one watches this movie you need to keep in mind that not all war movies are the same and the focus of the movie depends on who made the movie, how it was made and who is watching it? Make sense...of course not but in a nutshell keep an open mind. Is it about war? Yes some of it is. It is about bonding and camaraderie? Yes of course, it highlights strained relationships in very stressful and violent situations. I enjoyed the movie and being ex military in the 3rd Armour Division you do tend to pick things out BUT I could do that in just about any military movie I have seen especially from WWII to date. Without being too specific I spotted armor and infantry tactical strategies which confused me a bit but other than that I did enjoy this movie. War is ugly and this movie does not miss that point.","

"BrentHankins","16 October 2014","""Ideals are peaceful. History is violent.""These words, delivered by Brad Pitt's scarred and battle-weary Sgt. Don Collier, are meant to bring some level of comfort to Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman), the young man who found himself snatched unceremoniously out of the clerk's office and placed under Collier's command in the final days of WWII. Despite having no combat training to speak of, Ellison has been assigned as the new assistant driver of Fury, the Sherman tank that Collier and his men call home. Ellison has spent most of the war behind a desk, hammering out correspondence at 60 words per minute, but over the last few hours he's been gunning down Nazis in spectacularly gory fashion, and he's struggling to make sense of the carnage.Collier offers no other thoughts on the subject, having already forgotten about the previous battle and instead thinking about the skirmishes yet to come. He's a fierce figure who inspires confidence and loyalty among his men, who affectionately refer to him as ""Wardaddy."" But he's also terrifying to someone like Ellison, who finds himself woefully unprepared for the demands of his new vocation. During one of the film's early battle sequences, Ellison hesitates just long enough for tragedy to occur, and his subsequent brow-beating by Collier is followed by one of the most frightening and gut-wrenching scenes ever depicted in a war film. Ellison is quite literally forced to shun his own moral code and forsake any shred of humanity he still clings to, because Collier knows that if he doesn't, everyone in the unit will be dead.And what a unit it is, a motley crew of the highest order, comprised of a deeply religious gunner (Shia LeBeouf), a pugnacious redneck with a severe mean streak (Jon Bernthal), and a driver (Michael Pena) who drowns the filth and death in bottle after bottle of whatever booze he can find. But these soldiers are bound together by the sort of brotherhood that can only exist between men who have seen combat together: each is more than willing to die for the other, and the introduction of Ellison into their group is met with a hefty amount of resistance. The kid is an unknown, a variable they hadn't anticipated, and viewed as little more than a liability.But after proving his mettle during a nail-biting engagement with a superior German tank, Ellison gets the seal of approval from the rest of the boys. Collier even takes Ellison with him to explore an American-occupied village, and the two stumble upon a small apartment and its two female tenants. The film takes an interesting turn at this point, allowing the audience a glimpse into the exhaustion and sadness behind Collier's rugged exterior. A bath, a shave, and a nice dinner are a welcome respite from the day's butchery, but it's the second half of this sequence that truly shows how even the best of men can be transformed by the horror of war.Every member of the cast is at the top of their game here, even LeBeouf, whose well-documented public meltdowns feel like a distant memory. Despite being hampered by a script that regulates everyone but Collier and Ellison to skin-deep characterizations, the actors make the absolute most of it, bringing depth to characters that could very easily have been one-note portrayals. Pitt and Lerman, on the other hand, are given plenty to work with, and their dialogue exchange during the final moments of the film is one of the most emotionally gripping cinematic moments of the year.Director David Ayer does a superb job with some of the more human moments in Fury, but his skills are best showcased in the thrilling battle sequences, the majority of which were filmed using actual working tanks from the era. Interior shots are skin-crawlingly claustrophobic, especially when surrounded by the shouts, explosions and machine-gun fire that signify the chaos of battle. Exteriors are also handled well, although the film's frequent use of tracer ammunition makes some of the combat resemble the major clashes in the Star Wars films. Yes, it's historically accurate, but sometimes it's more distracting than engrossing.While Fury never quite ascends to the level of excellence offered by other WWII epics such as Saving Private Ryan or Cross of Iron, it remains a relentless, unflinching account of the unspeakable nature of war. To quote LeBeouf's character, ""Wait til you see what a man can do to another man."" When we see it, it's certainly not pleasant, and yet we can't look away.","

"Theo Robertson","29 March 2015","After complaining that the recent Neill Blomkamp film CHAPPIE suffered from a painfully ill thought out marketing campaign I must confess that David Aye's ferocious war actioner was an even bigger victim of poor marketing . Seeing the promos for this film last Autumn it was one movie I was going out of my way to avoid . You know the clips I'm talking about with handsome Brad Pitt bragging he'd been killing Germans all the way from North Africa to Germany . Okay I'll be the first to admit that some American units had this dubious privilege but compare this to many British units such as the 51st Highland division who'd spent 1940-45 fighting against the Germans non stop . That said I'm knowledgeable enough to realise that this pales in to almost insignificance when you realise the Chinese and Japanese had been fighting each other since the early 1930s . Europeans do have a very Eurocentric view of history but like so many people in Europe I wasn't keen on seeing yet another Hollywood revisionism of history especially when all the marketing material revolves around FOUR Americans in ONE American tank holding back hundreds of Waffen SS soldiers It's not often a film surprises me . No on second thoughts let me rephrase that and state it's not often a film shocks me but this is exactly what FURY did . For the most part it tries to avoid the Hollywood clichés and when it doesn't such as newbie and reluctant recruit Norman being introduced to the tight knit and battle hardened unit it does disguise the clichés quite well . Where the film works best is showing the relentless inhumanity of war . It's not a case of clean cut Americans with high moral values beating the ghastly Germans and nasty Nazis without suffering a scratch but a grim unrelenting battle to the death where there's no real winners until democracy triumphs over tyranny . Absolutely nothing is held back and as someone who has seen a lot of war films I was actually quite shocked as to some of the on screen incidents especially the scene where Norman is bloodied in to shooting a prisoner . This is a brutal and depressing film of the type I thought I'd never see Hollywood attempt especially since recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are still fresh in the memory It's hardly two hours of feel good entertainment but the bleak and nihilistic tone makes it an absolutely outstanding piece of American film making for the most part but then for the last half hour the film then proceeds to shoot itself in the foot , the head and every other piece of anatomy you can think of as Brad tells his men - all four of them - that they'll be defending a crossroads with their broken down tank against several hundred Waffen SS troops because ""I ain't ever run away from anything and I ain't about to start"" Bare in mind their tank has broken down , the war has only a few weeks to go and they could have easily made it back to safe lines without being charged with desertion or dereliction of duty so there's two options left to them . The sensible one that'll see them live and pick up their war pension or the stupid one that'll see them give the audience 20 minutes of ridiculous over the top mock heroics that the film company can stick in the trailers . I suppose being film characters they'd quite happily sacrifice their lives to do the film company a favour but at the same time I'd like to see a film where characters do something understandably human and sensible , especially if they've got American accents . The final climatic battle scene is as every bit as ridiculous and overblown as you'd expect to see in the worst Hollywood Rambo type flag waver as literally hundreds of Germans are mown down left , right , centre , background and foreground which goes totally against the bleak nihilistic scenes that preceded it . The fact that it ends with most of the Americans dead doesn't make it any less ridiculous This is a great shame because up until the final act I was very impressed with what I was watching . Again let me repeat this is in no way a feel good movie and if you don't like war films you'd quickly be turning this off due to the graphic violence on display and this refusal to sugar coat the grim and horrific face of conflict is what made FURY so refreshing to me . Such a pity the film had to end on a seen it all before cliché ridden denounment","

"bryank-04844","12 August 2015","When Brad Pitt signs up to kill Nazis in a WWII movie, you say, ""YES"". This particular movie is called 'Fury', and is a solid, very good war film. It's brutal, violent, raw, and has enough of a fresh feel to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire 134-minute runtime. Instead of being out in the open, walking the fields of France or another nazi occupied country, 'Fury' takes place mostly inside a small steel tank with five guys led by 'Wardaddy' (Pitt), during the final month of WWII. The claustrophobia sets in quickly and gives us an ample amount of time to dig deep into each soldier inside the tank.Writer-director David Ayer is known for his cop drama films, ('End of Watch', 'Sabotage', 'Street Kings', and 'Training Day') to name a few. And he pulls from his past work to take on the fierceness of this merciless story of a squad of U.S. tanks, winning the war against the Germans. It's a story you won't soon forget, yet in the final moments of the film, Ayer pulls a stunt that almost ruins everything that came before it. Despite that horrible aspect, 'Fury' is quite good.Wardaddy is a tank commander with the 2nd Armored Division who has been around for quite a few wars. He's a seasoned soldier, rough, tough, and has seen it all. However, there is something deeper inside him going on that shows us there's more to him than just being a nazi killing machine like we saw in Quentin Tarantino's 'Inglorious Basterds'. But his sheer barbaric ways show when he initiates a newcomer named Norman (Logan Lerman), a young kid who is a trained typist for the army, who is literally thrown into Wardaddy's tank as an assistant driver, even though Norman has never seen the inside of a tank. Wardaddy forces Norman to shoot a captured S.S. Officer point blank in the head, and that will be the first of many things Norman is forced to do over the course of this movie.The other soldiers inside 'Fury', which is painted on the tank's gun barrel are Boyd (Shia LaBeouf), a rough solider who is also super religious, Trini (Michael Pena), the driver with a drinking problem, and Grady (Jon Bernthal), the aggressive red neck jerk of the highest level. These seem like stereotypes, but I can assure you, Ayer has written them with a good amount of depth, particularly LaBeouf's character who hasn't been this good in anything for many years. As the war is coming to a quick end and as the Nazis are still fighting to their last breath, the Americans are taking town by town, usually led by Wardaddy's tank unit.After the successful take over of a nazi occupied town, there is a moment for some down time where Wardaddy takes Norman under his wing and up to an apartment where a mother (Anamaria Marinca) and her teenage daughter (Alicia von Rittberg) come face to face with the two U.S. soldiers. They are terrified at first, but Wardaddy puts them at ease, and the women end up making a meal and drinks for the two soldiers. This might be the best scene in the film as we get a small glimpse at someone who has been through hell and seen such horrible atrocities, still trying to have a normal life of routine and genuine pleasantries. But war is terrible, and this nice situation doesn't last long as the rest of Wardaddy's crew heads up to the apartment and ruins this seemingly nice setting. It's not their fault really, but it's rather what the war and the stuff they had to do to survive and win has done to them, turning them into animals.The climactic scene doesn't seem to make any sense as the Captain of the unit tells Wardaddy and a few other tanks go on a big mission to stop a treasure trove of Nazis that are headed to a certain location. Even though the war is quickly coming to an end, and this mission doesn't seem to have much of a reason, it's unclear why the captain would send these great soldiers on what seems like a suicide mission. And this we are in the steel tank again as our soldiers fight a never-ending stream of nazi soldiers. But again, Ayer pulls this wild card out of his back pocket, that completely negates anything that came before it, and almost destroys his own film.Pitt is great in his role and gives a few layers of depth to his brute soldier character. Lerman ('The Perks of Being a Wallflower') plays the newbie who is forced to hold a gun and kill any German soldier he faces very nicely. And the rest of the crew turn in amazing performances as well. The set pieces, uniforms, and tanks all add to the realistic setting of 1945 Germany. And Ayer's direction keeps you on edge, particularly during one of the tank battle sequences. 'Fury' is an ultra-violent and bloody war film and is a solid entry into the WWII genre, however it almost imploded on itself at the end, leaving a bitter taste.","

"BeneCumb","15 December 2014","Panoramic war movies with the participation of famous actors have always caught great success and ticket income. No exception is Fury, where Brad Pitt for ""older"" generation and Logan Lerman and Shia LaBeouf for ""younger"" generation are definitely the names to attract audience. And yes, they do great in this movie, pity that LaBeouf's character was not so elaborated and spent limited time on screen. All three have successfully diverged from plain ""nice-guys-with-cute-faces"" roles and have (Pitt, LaBeouf) or attempting to (Lerman) participate in something more versatile and dramatic.Fury has firm expectations for this, but unfortunately the script has focused on action and battling rather than smooth logic of events. Clichéd characters and unrealistic events and solutions prevail too much, and feeling of time and space is impaired on several occasions (the time-frame between Lerman's character detecting German soldiers and first shots from their tank is especially odd). Moreover, the ending is trivial as well.Thus, 8 points for acting and 4 for the plot from me, but if this movie has made the younger people pondering on and over the essence of war, then it has gained its end. Anyhow, there are too many movies focusing on visual effects and reasoning out there.","

I didn't really rate Pena until seeing End of Watch & this, I was dubious at first.Fury seems to have annoyed several historians, I don't know much about all that so my 9/10 rating takes none of that into account.I loved how gritty it was, reminded me of Saving Private Ryan/Band of Brothers & depicted how brutal war can be & is.Yes, okay, the final scenes might be a bit ridiculous & over- exaggerated but that takes nothing away from this film for me, I would recommend to anyone & everyone","

"Tweekums","1 April 2017","Sergeant Don 'Wardaddy' Collier is the commander of a US Sherman tank nicknamed 'Fury'; he and his crew have been in the thick of it in North Africa, Normandy and are now in Germany in the dying days of the war. Private Norman Ellison has only been in the army for eight weeks and is trained as an office typist until for some reason he is assigned to Collier's crew to replace a dead member he is definitely not ready for the terrors of war. He is certainly the outsider in the crew. As they progress through various actions he sees is baptism of fire and becomes a hardened fighter. Eventually collier is ordered to take five tanks to defend a vital crossroads; four are destroyed leaving 'Fury to defend the location then a battalion of SS turn up and one hell of a firefight ensues.If you are looking for a war film with lots of brutal action then this is likely to be the film for you; people are decapitated; burn and are blown up. There is also the feeling that secondary characters could die at any time and as the end approaches it feels as if anybody could die. There is a problem with the characters unfortunately; early on we see Collier forcing Ellison to shoot a German prisoner and the rest of the 'hardened crew' are even less likable I almost found myself cheering for the German Tiger tank that was picking off the 'good guys'. The action scenes were intense and nicely captured some of the confusion of battle even if, as others have noted, the tracer fire looked like lasers in a sci-fi movie. The ending definitely requires one to suspend ones disbelief as hundreds of Germans take enormous casualties before they make the slightest headway against this single tank even though they have anti-tank weapons. The cast lead by Brad Pitt, in the role of Collier, does a solid job making us believe in the characters even if some of those characters are pretty hard to like. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of war films; just don't expect it to be too believable.","

"meeza","9 July 2015","I feel that Writer-Director David Ayer's World War II film ""Fury"" got massacred with many unfair negative reviews. Sure, it might have been 20 minutes too long (so it wasn't too fast but it was furious), sure it mimicked ""Saving Private Ryan"" mucho with its many narrative missiles (whatever that means?), but I sure did enjoy it anyway. ""Fury"" stars Brad Pitt as Sgt. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier who commands a Sherman tank Fury and its five-man crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. Ayer based the film on real life war incidents told by former War veterans who manned Army tanks in World War II. It just seemed like yesterday or better said ""ayer"" when Ayer wrote the ""Training Day"" screenplay, and after a few solid directorial action-movie efforts including ""End of Watch"", one could say Ayer is a director for today's action movies, not yesterday's; you got all that. The cast of ""Fury"" was the bomb! That basterd Brad Pitt was on target as a Nazi Killer again as Wardaddy. Shia LaBeouf can still act, besides his real life garbage-head shenanigans, he was sound here as the preaching tank Private Boyd ""Bible"" Swan. Lorgan Lerman was a perk in the movie as the scared rookie Private Norman Ellison. Jon Bernthal was no ""walking dead"" tank Private as the aggressive Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis. And to round out the Tankers, Michael Pena was not as good as the rest but still did not misfire as tank sharpshooter Private Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia. Maybe the jury is still out on ""Fury"" and still has to pass the test of time, but I still think that this movie did not tank in my round of cinematic machinery. *****Excellent","

"Leofwine_draca","21 May 2016","David Ayer is an up-and-down director for me. For every film of his I love (STREET KINGS, SABOTAGE) there seems to be one I equally hate (END OF WATCH). Thankfully, FURY is at the top end of his scale, a straightforward war epic centred around the crew of a single tank as they trundle through the German countryside and encounter Nazis at every turn.This is a war film as it should be: gruelling, violent, and dehumanising. The attention to detail is remarkable and the action scenes are expertly staged, as you'd expect from the experienced Ayer; you really feel like you're on the ground with these soldiers and taking part in the combat. The first tank assault is my favourite scene, as it's an example of blistering, never-seen-before action, although the extended powerhouse climax is almost as good.Yes, the story is predictable and the clear-cut characters a little too simplistic. But Ayer counters this by incorporating interesting actors into the tale. A weary Brad Pitt plays virtually the same character as he did in INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS and is fine for it, while Shia LaBeouf gets to play a character support role for a change. Jon Bernthal (THE WALKING DEAD) remains a scene-stealer, and Logan Lerman shows a little more experience in his acting than in previous years. FURY is a dark and depressing film, but the vibrancy of the cinematography and all-out action makes it one to watch.","

"mjjusa-1","17 October 2014","It is hard to put into words just how loathsome a movie 'Fury' is. The self hating writer/director must have correctly calculated that any WWII veteran of the European Theater must be in his or her's late eighties by now, thus avoiding the real potential of one of them slapping the living scheisse out of him for this atrocity. It begins with a ridiculous scene, is of the war movie genre that demands German soldiers running upright and without cover toward machine guns so our anti-heroes can mow them down conveniently, and consistently opts for opportunities to shove the new hip narrative that lovingly depicts American soldiers as murderous, war crime committing, raping thugs. See: 'Inglorious Basterds.' Much of it is hard to watch, especially after 'Saving Private Ryan' which set a high bar for any war movie following, the rest is drivel. And, not even good drivel at that. High marks (pardon the pun) though, for the German soldiers surrounding the tank, who stop firing for inexplicable reasons, but which coincide with long discussions on war and friendship by the tank crew.","

"dougdoepke","11 April 2021","If you like lightning tracers, mass killing, no plot, and two repetitive hours of runtime, then this is your piece of meat. Of course it helps if you're a teenage boy with no knowledge of real warfare or death. Frankly the general outlines made me think of the cowboy flicks of my youth, where cavalry killed massed indians, no one cried out in agony or even bled, and the good, Bible-carrying guys always won. The battlefield logic here must have been hatched in somebody's cowboy movie dream, where the enemy simply crowds together waiting to be mowed down. On the other hand, at least this 2014 version doesn't prettify the guys or their battle-field surroundings, so maybe there's some progress in teen entertainment after all. But for those who take the two-hours as mere entertainment, remember that at a subliminal level you're being prepared for future wars, where good guys always win, death is quiet, heroes are made, and mass killing really isn't so bad after all. Regrettably that's apparent here, even if the visuals are colofully spectacular. Anyway, for this now 81-year old, it looks like few things change after all, especially in Hollywood.","

"azanti0029","23 October 2014","Its April 1945, the war is almost over in Europe and the Allies are pushing into Germany. No one wants to die in the last few weeks of the war and such is the challenge facing the crew of the Sherman Firefly 'Fury' - When their assistant driver is killed, newcomer Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman, an actor clearly with a long career ahead of him) is assigned to a tank crew in what almost seems like a clerical error. His crew are veterans since Africa and unsympathetic to his nerves and fears. As the unit pushes into Germany to relieve various stranded units and capture a town he is forced into a baptism of fire he will not easily forget. I went to see this film with my wife (Who hates war movies normally and I kind of tricked her into going) and a make up artist friend of mine and all three of us enjoyed it for different reasons. So hats off to the Director because my wife rarely enjoys a war movie, but she felt the film was good because it concentrated on the intimate relationship between the five men that is formed in such a small space and that is the focus of the movie. It has many similarities to the movie 'Lebanon' (A film set inside and told entirely from the perspective of a crew of a tank in the Middle East) in many respects - and although this film isn't quite totally tank interior POV as that one was it captures the grime, the sweat and the oil of the confined space perfectly. Writer / Director David Ayer has managed to present us with a environment that we have rarely seen before in a World War 2 movie. Despite the very English countryside being a bit of a giveaway to some of the location shooting, the Production Design here is top notch and for those into their history there is much to enjoy, not least of which is that this is the only movie in history to feature an original working Tiger tank, care of Bovington tank Museum. The acting by the five leads is solid with Jon Berthanl being especially unpleasant as the tanks gunner. Say what you like about Shia LeBeouf being an oddball, but he clearly can act and that is all I care about when I go to see him on the screen, Micheal Pena and Brad Pitt come over as the Mother and the Father of the group, with Pitt's pragmatic Commander teaching some lessons to their latest recruit with brutal reality. He doesn't want his men to die, and therein at least lies the one fault in the movie.Given a mission by local Commander (Jason Issacs rolling off his American Army Commander accent with ease) they find themselves alone having to defend a vital crossroads. Aware that the enemy are coming and may charge head long into a company of cooks and clerks down the road we're told they're all that is left to get in the way, but this doesn't really ring true. Its April 1945 and the Allies were superior everywhere and after the Battle of the Bulge Cooks and Clerks were well aware that occasionally they might have to pick up their rifles and could have done so here. But Brad Pitt's Don 'Wardaddy' Collier growls he is going to 'stay' and the rest of his men decide to remain, even though earlier he was very clear he wanted his men to survive the war. This was perhaps the only bit of the film that wasn't entirely convincing, but it didn't spoil my enjoyment of the movie though the battle at the end began to border on the unrealistic after a Germans began missing a tank with Panzerfausts from a range of a few feet. All in all this is a good solid film which is hard to fault. It presents a realistic depiction of war and shows things as they were. One scene where the G.I's capture a town and what can only be described as a consensual rape effectively happens will leave many people feeling uncomfortable but that is the reality of Germany in 1945, women weren't just raped by the Russians, but the Western Allied soldiers too, even if some of them were a little more polite about it. We might not like to talk about it, but it happened - In victory in war men do not always behave like gentleman and even the greenest of recruits can soon become a harden killer. My wife said she enjoyed the movie because she felt as though she had experienced and lived in a tank after seeing it on the big screen (we saw it on an Imax) and yes, while the final confrontation was more for entertainment than for accuracy, this is a film I urge you to see none the less.","

"lilgrasshoppah","31 October 2016","War is hell. It is a macabre sarcasm of Life. It perverts all normal socially-accepted truths. And, in such a hell, only demons can survive -- - only demons can know how to excel.War Daddy (the inhuman, nearly immortal, soulless, progenitor of all destruction) says it best: ""We're not here for 'Right or Wrong'... we are here to kill them.""Perhaps, one imagines that there will be peace and happiness, beyond the unrelenting violence... but, after such implacable destruction, not only of lives... but of Life... what consolation can there be?Every chicken-hawk, war-mongering coward, should be required to witness this film. It is harrowing. It is cleansing. It teaches that violence begets violence. All that is pure and good, is destroyed by war... and it is only the purity of goodness, that restores goodness after the war is over. One wonders if it does any good to know the fact... for the demons in charge refuse to learn. And their deaths, after a time, proves nothing.I am filled with unrelenting sadness over this film. Its perfection shall go on, unappreciated. Its unblinking honesty will go on, unheeded. For, there will be other wars (there are many, now). There will be other demons, who's lust for conquest will obliterate everything they know... even/especially the things they profess to love.Because war is hell, and paradise does not exist in this realm... or, even after. The perversity of war... the final image... testifies to this fact. Life with war, is tainted. A poisoned well does not come clean.","

"billygoat1071","27 October 2014","Fury strives to depict the true nature of war. There isn't much of a plot to discuss, neither any historical events worthy to mention within its World War II setting. It simply just pictures the job works: violence is scary, war changes people, and their journey could be a lot dreary than exciting. Director David Ayer is perfect when it comes to this strategy; this bleak, unfeeling atmosphere alone makes it quite compelling for its themes. But it also moves a little backwards when it starts featuring the main action. Though the precision stays faithful, the loudness and spectacle rob the focus of its more ugly view at war. In the end, Fury still deserves credit for both elements, even if they don't seem to fit appropriately for the central message.As said, it is not about the plot. We're basically just watching what soldiers experience in the field or inside the tank. There is no historical background needed to explore other than the fact that this is WWII. Another story here is about a recruit, whose only skill in the job is typewriting, forced to kill no matter how old or desperate the enemy is. His point of view is meant to portray a soldier's growth into the battlefield; we first encounter him known for his incompetence towards violence, and then slowly subsides his sensitivity and starting to gain the same attitude of his crew. Not only towards humanity it tries to examine, even the war itself may not be easy nor adventurous after all. Traveling through places, although getting attacked in unexpected minute and discovering bodies around the road, can be boring, which suddenly makes the crew bond every once in a while. Not everyone at the enemy side are bad, neither everyone in their side are nice. The film succeeds at breaking the misinterpretation of the context of war, giving awareness to what people actually struggle in this conflict.Once we get to the action, the tank battles are impressively constructed with consistency at showing each of the soldier's duty beneath their tank. There is suspense, violence driven in every set piece. The only setback in these sequences is how it tries to build some bombast at the explosions. No matter what, it's always going to be loud and there will always be lights flashing (especially when they have tracers,) but during the fighting, it suddenly becomes one sided, no longer feels for their enemy, unlike the complexity at the smaller scenes. The characters also don't get the development they deserve, they do have some intriguing backstory, but still remains being in one note. Thankfully, the cast helps adding some depth in them.Fury is solid enough, but the anti-war element can be a little unsatisfying. It portrays the horrors of war by heart and soul, and yet finds glory at the actual battles. The action could have suited better if the movie's only intention is to be accurate in a military work, but it come into question when it also have this strong sober perspective to human violence. The climax as well feels it like it belongs to a movie built for blockbuster filmmaking. But the thing is, none of them are actually bad; it effectively pictures what kind of hell war is and the action is terrifically directed. It's just that both aspects tell a different opinion. In spite of that, it's still one of the most absorbing films you'll see in a while, with excellent production and filmmaking. These are the qualities that endures the value of Fury overall, also witnessing real military routine, firearm, dirt and battles already makes it quite interesting.","

"sukanya-samy","1 April 2016","Ideals are peaceful, but history is always violent. And the history of humanity has been violent as hell. What is it in us that we fight over land, women and wealth? It is survival? Or is it the sense of power? These are some things I wonder about usually in a war movie. Fury was no different.Fury, released in 2014 is about an US Army Sergeant, Wardaddy (Brad Pitt) and his crew of 5 men. One of them is a rookie who was trained as a typewriter but was enlisted in the war. The story is about the last leg of the allies marching into Germany with Wardaddy and his Sherman tank called Fury. It shows the soft side of Wardaddy and his seasoned group of men and traverses how the kid, a typist, turns from his ideals to violence for survival.Story - There are parts in the movie that give you the chills. Like the story Gordo narrates at the table of the German house and makes you wonder just how violent and disturbed men and women become during war.Wars wound you psychologically and those wounds probably never heal.It also shows little instance of normality like Norman thinks he can stay in touch with the young woman he met in Germany after the war. Something I am sure many men would have liked to hold on to. Shows a multitude of emotions - fear, wrath, cruelty, warmth, generosity and rage. Some of it is unbelievable like the climax where they show one tank battling an entire regiment. That is where Fury lost out for me.Acting - I think the performances are stellar. Each of the main characters stands out in his own way. Brad Pitt as Wardaddy is a pleasant to watch. Pitt has been doing good movies and I think it is high time he wins an Oscar. Shia LeBeouf as Bible is serious and plays his part well too. Logan Lerman as Norman is the hero in the movie for me - as a rookie he portrays the disbelief and the innocence that young boys go into war with but come out as hardened men. The story shows how Wardaddy trains Norman to be someone who he is not.Direction - David Ayer, known for Training Day and the first Fast & Furious has provided specifics that a lot of American movies do not show. Rape, cruelty and homicides were part of American troops as well - they are no different from other countries. Its how humans react in extreme situations - some adapt to survive and some cave in. But some of the scenes (especially the last sequence) were not really believable. But having said that the camaraderie that Ayer wanted to portray comes through really nicely.Cinematography - I really liked the camera work. It looked real (maybe not as much as Saving Private Ryan or The Thin Red Line). It wasn't shaky and the sound effects were great with almost real sets.Special Mention - I really liked the dinner scene with Wardaddy, Norman and the two German women. It was at a completely different pace compared to the rest of the movie and I think it was supposed to build character. That's where you see the soft side of Pitt and how his crew has become what it has.All in all, it is a good one time watch but I wouldn't go back to it. One reason could be that though the performances were great, I didn't really connect with the characters as much. I would give it a B+.Let me know what you thought of it.","

Why go to the trouble of having realist weapons and armour depicted in your film, if such ridiculous things happen?

"classicsoncall","26 October 2014","""Fury"" is being heralded as the current/next great war movie but I think time will tone the rhetoric down. It doesn't have the epic sweep of ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Band of Brothers"", and when you come right down to it, it's not even about the second World War so much as an intense look at an American tank crew that views their job as 'the best one they ever had'. All quite facetious of course because war is hell, and scenes in the movie are intended to convey that fact.Overall it's a fine movie with exceptional performances by Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman as the new member of the Fury crew who learns the facts of war life real quick while under fire when hesitation can mean certain death. The understated message of the film is announced by Pitt's 'Wardaddy' character - ""Ideals are peaceful. History is violent"". With that as a reference point, I don't quite know what to make of the unplanned rendezvous with the German cousins. It seems to me you had three types of Germans during the War, those who were Nazis, those who supported them, and those who had to bide their time and not openly defy them as a guarantee of survival. Would a young German girl have been able to share a romantic interlude with an American soldier given the intense propaganda prevalent in Nazi Germany? Not impossible perhaps, but what are the odds? I guess the idea that was meant to be conveyed was best illustrated with the character of Private Ellison (Logan Lerman). Coming in cold, the newly assigned soldier encountered practically every conceivable emotion and situation that one might experience in an entire deployment, but in a span of only a couple of days. The idea was expressed at one point by a soldier who stated that the eyes take it all in but the mind is unable to process all the death, destruction and inhumanity of war and make any sense of it. Presumably because there is no sense to it, it's men following orders with a mission to defend their country.The final battle? Well it's a movie after all. My instinct tells me that five soldiers in a tank aren't going to be able to wipe out an entire German squadron with a kill ratio of twenty to one, even if that's the way it appears on film. The German soldier giving a bye to Private Ellison - it's not unheard of, but comes across here as just a little too unrealistic. I guess each viewer will have to be their own judge with ""Fury"", maybe more so than with most war films.","

However I think it is the best war film since Black Hawk Down! -The story was really good and it had a lot to offer in the way of grisly realism of war, as well as some more optimistic themes attached. The tone was heavy because war. The pace was better during the second half. In fact the film was a little 'eh' until about half way through, then it was fantastic.-The acting was on point. Brad Pitt was great. Percy Jackson was really great! And, to my great surprise, Shia LaBeouf was my favorite character! By the way, his character, called ""Bible,"" is a prime example of a well-done faith-based character in a non-Christian film! -The music was really good. Oscar nod incoming.-The cinematography was really good. Oscar win incoming.-There are some downsides and I will put them all under content.-Content: The film features some brutal war violence. It did not shy away from much of anything and even had a few (like 2) scenes where I questioned if that was needed or not. Also the film had strong language in it. It got a little bit better after the first half, but it was really bad.-So in all, Fury is a well-acted, well-made, entertaining war movie that is just great! It also featured the best tank fight in maybe ever. However, if you can't tolerate war violence and excess language, this is not the film for you. For those who can, I would say Fury is easily worth seeing in theaters! Solid 8/10.","

"BigGuy","20 October 2014","There is an ongoing trend in movies about World War II to be ""gritty"", in other words showing as many body parts flying as possible. Be it a leg amputated by machine gun, or a head vaporizing from a shell. While perhaps it is ""realistic"", it isn't necessary, and hides the fact that this movie is a string of clichés, with a few trite expressions thrown in to make Brad Pitt seem Oscar worthy.The most obvious cliché is the innocent kid getting thrown into the war and seeing how gruesome war is. He tries to maintain his ideals in the brutal face of war. Everyone else is already hardened and cynical and on the brink of being animals. The spoiler here is obvious, the innocent boy starts enjoying killing Nazis. The turn is actually terribly done, since basically he ends up killing some Germans and suddenly likes it. Just like that.Aside from the clichés and gore, it isn't badly done for a war movie. I have to sat Shia Lebeouf probably does the best acting of his career and probably does the best acting of any of the main characters.","

"staercke","4 November 2014","SPOILERS!!!I've seen the movie and I would rather have them describe it as a WW2 action movie instead of ""authentic"". Just because you show gore doesn't mean it's realistic. The last combat scene is a disgrace. I wanted to leave the theater.The Allied campaign in the West was NOT A WALK IN THE PARK. The allied casualties were staggering. Even when the Germans lost millions of troops in the East, battling at 3 fronts (Russia, Italy and the West) and the Luftwaffe was all but destroyed. After June 1944 the Anglo-American loses were as high as 2.000 troops per division per month. Educate yourself, don't believe Hollywood. Read books! Anthony Beevor has great books (Stalingrad, The Fall of Berlin, Normandy,...)SPOILERS!1) The scene with the German anti tank guns hidden in the woods. Very slow moving Shermans while the Germans had plenty of time to aim. They missed all shots. Of course the Allies quickly destroyed them.2) Brad Rambo commits a war crime by shooting an unarmed German prisoner. Although this happened on both sides, it was still a war crime. Funny thing is that they called the German a murderer because he wore an American jacket. Yet a few minutes later we see dickhead Shane from the Walking Dead wearing a German helmet and jacket... Double standards. 3) The scene in town. Fury comes driving slowly from behind a corner with a German anti tank gun aiming at them from within a store from 50 yards away. Yet they miss AGAIN.4) Don't get me started at the scene with the 2 women. 5) The Tiger battle: somewhat realistic that the Tiger knocks out 3 of the Shermans. Yet Fury gets hit twice (2 times) and survives. A good Tiger crew would just turn their tank on the spot to hide the thinner back side. Also, why do the other Sherman tanks blow up while getting hit from the front, while Fury survives 2 shots from close by? Also the Tiger is close enough the get destroyed by the standard Sherman gun. 6) last scene. A battle hardened Waffen SS battalion with every other soldier wearing a panzerfaust (bazooka). Fury stands disabled on the road. The Germans run like dumb chickens in front of Fury's machine guns over and over again. Even when the Germans start using the Panzerfausts, they seem to miss from a few yards away. They only use 3 panzerfausts... Yet they continue to shoot Fury with their machine guns... The Fury crew shoots around and throws grenades blindly, killing Germans with every shot/grenade. In reality the Germans would go to cover after the first fatality's, regroup, get anti tank equipment and take out Fury within minutes after the start of the fight. Fury doesn't have machine guns at the back or sides... Brad Rambo gets out starts manning the 50 cal but still NOT A SINGLE German hits him, until the worst sniper in German history hits Brad Rambo 3 times from 100 yards and he still survives. Also his corps seems untouched even with 2 German hand grenades exploding within a yard from him. 7) The last survivor of Fury hides under the tank. A young Waffen SS soldier sees him, but decides to let him be. Of course... every Waffen SS soldier would do that after they killed more than 100 of his comrades... 8) The last scene where the camera zooms out showing Fury with a mass of dead Germans around it is just plain dumb. ﻿","

"bob the moo","7 December 2014","This year has been a very busy one for me with time seeming to race by; indeed so much so that it did not occur to me it was getting close to awards season in early 2015. This thought entered my head a good part way into watching Fury; I was wondering why it was being the way it was and why it seemed so determined to be so very much one way, then I realized that this is one of many films that are mostly about awards success for all involved. The general narrative here is that we join an American tank during the final months of WWII, fighting their way as part of an assault into the heart of Germany. The small team are led by Don Collier, a tough and experienced commander, who has to keep his team focused, alive, and moving forward. A team where a death means that they are joined by green recruit Norman.This is the narrative, but really the film is not about a story so much as showing that ""war is hell"", with lots of performances, speeches, gore, and predictability in the plotting. To say it is relentless in this is an understatement – it never stops pushing this message and if there is even a small chance to remind us, then the film takes us there. Every character will die once we start to engage with them; any character that the crew engage with will suffer and die, and so on. As an exercise in nihilism then the film does mostly work because it is relentless in how pointless it is, whether it be cruelty of man, child soldiers, the horror of random violence, the physiological effects of killing, or anything else, the film is really on point for these. The problem with it is not these aspects but rather than it pretty much contains nothing else.There is the feeling watching it that as well as a script supervisor and someone watching continuity, we also had someone making sure that every single ""war is hell"" cliché was covered too. This continues through the film and to be honest the lack of anything else did make it less and less impacting as it went on – almost numbing, which in no way is the thing it was looking for. This is not to say that it is not professionally made and very authentic in its portrayal of life on the front, or the use of real tanks, but just that this cannot make up for the lack of content. Despite that so much of it is about the pointlessness of it all, the final section turns into a boys' own adventure where we see the SS mown down like we were still at war and this was a propaganda film showing the glory of death and sacrifice. It is such an odd change to the tone of the film, but at least it allows all of those involved an heroic Oscar clip death, and of course a brief (and ridiculous) moment of humanity to end the film on.The cast are all solid enough, but it is really hard to escape the feeling that they are all playing clichés to a certain extent. Pitt, Peña, Bernthal, Parrack, Isaacs, Henke, all do solid work but nothing really more than that in terms of characters. Lerman does as well as he can with a simple ""eyes of the audience"" character. Technically the film is very impressive whether it be the use of authentic tanks, the scale of the film, or the sound and gore, which are flinch-inducing. None of this is an issue, it is just that there is little beyond it and as a result the film does feel like it is hammering the same point endlessly, rather than telling a good story and letting this come out of it.","

"michaelRokeefe","8 June 2015","Based on actual events. As the war was grinding to a finish, Nazi Germany was nearing total collapsing. The five man crew of an American Sherman tank, nicknamed Fury, guided by a battle worn and tested Army sergeant named Wardaddy(Brad Pitt)gets the assignment of their most dangerous and deadly mission into Nazi territory. Because of loss of a crew member, a young desk jockey(Logan Lerman)has somehow been assigned into their ranks. The private of course is getting his first look at battle. The Fury is assigned to cover the flank of primary forces forging toward Berlin; the crew find themselves facing the brunt of the battle, out-gunned and outnumbered. The fate of the Fury darkens as the enemy fire becomes desperate and relentless with no hope of reinforcements being available. Against the staggering odds, Wardaddy's crew stays together as the Fury stands its ground to complete the mission.Strong war violence with grisly images and the expected strong language prevails. Even unlikeable characters change your opinions. For certain, war is Hell. The apt cast includes: Shia LaBeouf, John Bernthal, Michael Pena, Kevin Vance, Jim Parrack, Jason Isaacs and Alicia von Rittberg.","

"koltonbrett","16 June 2022","Starring Brad Pitt, Jon Bernthal, Shia LaBeouf, Micheal Peña, and Logan Lerman. Need I say more? Even if the rest of the movie wasn't any good, watching these 5 fantastic actors working so closely together for 2 hours was something I had to see. Their performances in Fury are captivating. The movie as a whole is enthralling. It did exactly what it should have: it focused in on WW2 tank life. The tank action is exciting, suspenseful, and fascinating. The battle sequences are epic and satisfying. The movie is marinated in melancholic ambience. Logan Lerman
gives one of his best performances as a young and innocent soldier who must adapt to the horrors of war. He beautifully expresses the toll it takes on the character he is playing. This is an emotional and heartbreaking movie experience. It left me in a
melancholic state after watching. That speaks to the
effectiveness of the storytelling and the acting performances. Also contributing to this tone is the beautiful soundtrack by Steven Price. Norman's theme song is one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking songs I've heard in a movie. I love it when a
movie makes me feel so deeply. This thoughtful and action-packed film is a success in every aspect.","

"russmillerwy-957-682439","19 October 2014","Fury has one of those ""the only good morality in wartime is no morality"" themes. I admired the sound effects in the battle scenes. They'll probably win an award for those. But I hated the script and the dialog and gave up on it altogether after about 40 minutes. It lacks class. It is in many ways the opposite of Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers, which were about redemption through suffering and sacrifice under extreme duress. Fury was about degeneracy becoming the new righteousness. Ugly, and maybe even downright revisionist and historically inaccurate. Almost like a pornographic comic book version of history designed to appeal to adolescent boys raised on Game of Thrones episodes and Grand Theft Auto video games. As somome who actually spent a couple of years as a cavalry scout in the army, I can also say that the battle scenes lacked authenticity. Particularly in the amateurish way the troops talked to each other and moved during combat. Again, much more like a dumbed down and superficial comic book or a video game than something trying to simulate historical reality.","

"fung0","25 October 2015","Having scanned the reviews of Fury, I was expecting a typical 'how we won the war' kind of B movie, with all the clichés in place. But that's not what I discovered upon watching the film. This is one of the more powerful anti-war statements I've ever seen on the screen, cleverly put together, tightly directed and remarkably well-acted.The title tells you what the film is about: *fury*. The fury that overcomes soldiers in war. This film, better than any other I've seen, demolishes the myth of the heroic warrior. Instead, what we see are the degraded, brutalized monsters that war creates. Brad Pitt, in particular, is brilliant as an utterly horrific character. He perfectly represents what a person must become in order to be an effective soldier.The focus of the story is on Pitt training a new member of the tank crew, a young guy who's previously only been a clerk. Pitt tries to tear apart this man's humanity as quickly as possible, for his own good and the good of the whole crew. At first, we can only see Pitt as an evil madman. But events in the film gradually prove that his attitude is the only valid response to the insane circumstances.The focus is on the US troops, but there's no favoritism. The action takes place at the very tail end of the European war, with the US marching through Germany. But the Germans (quite accurately) are shown as still highly disciplined, still dangerous, willing to fight to the last man. This movie isn't even remotely about which side was 'right' and which was 'wrong.' It's about the experience of the troops who are forced to make up in blood for what the politicians have failed to achieve with diplomacy.Previous war films have always held back a bit, stopped short of showing us the full horror of war. This one goes several steps further, and is therefore far more successful at showing us why soldiers return to society as crazed wrecks. This is the only film I can think of that really gives us a gut-feel for what PTSD is all about. We see what happens to men when they're forced to abandon their humanity in order to simply 'get the job done.' Ultimately, even survival becomes a secondary consideration. By the end, we begin to understand - with massive irony - what a 'good soldier' truly is. What he *has* to be.I wouldn't recommend Fury to everyone. The level of violence is gut-wrenching, partly in terms of visual gore, but even more strongly in terms of emotions. Things happen in this film that are truly beyond all reason, logic or morality. But that's exactly the point. Fury is a brutal, nasty movie, but it does give us at least a dim sense of war is *really* like. And therefore, what a heinous, unforgivable crime we commit when we allow wars to happen.","

"view_and_review","10 March 2016","I'm not a war movie fan, but every once in a while I will step outside of my bubble and sneak a peek at a war movie. I did this a few days ago and I liked what I saw. Yes, it was bloody, foreboding, gruesome and depressing, but amidst all that was a story of a small group that operated a tank called, ""Fury"".This group of soldiers was a real motley crew. For the most part you wouldn't bring any of them home to marry your daughter but they were a good bunch for the task at hand: war. War is ugly, so were they. War is uncouth, so were they. War is something you like to keep far away from home, as were they.It wasn't a superhero story though there was some heroism. It wasn't a love story though you can say they loved each other. At the base of it all was a story about how war can transform anyone, for better or for worse, by its very nature. It's an ugly topic but it was done well.","

"drystyx","21 July 2015","This war film set in Germany during World War II succeeds on all levels, and I think it was meant to do so.In order to do that, we get a few theatrics in the form of what appear to be coincidences, but in actuality aren't so coincidental.The theatrics of this tank being the only one to survive a big blow out battle of tanks is simply the result of one tank surviving. It happens to be this one. When one takes that into consideration, one realizes there is nothing really special about the five man crew or its commander.After that, we get a lot of realism and gore on the order of Private Ryan. What this and Ryan do that other war films don't do, is simply relate the gore without either glorifying it or reveling in it. We don't get immediate results of death, but we don't get the modern era reveling of seeing how long a burning human can scream either. It's all done on a relatively realistic scale.And that's what makes this action war film on a par with Ryan. In really has no more coincidences in it than Ryan does, a film that bends over backwards to save anyone from New York or California, magically unable to be hit by bullets, as Hollywood likes to do, However, the end game does have the cliché of ""order of deaths"" pretty much down, but one coincidence is to be expected in a melee of violence.The characters are probably even better than Ryan's characters. There are obvious similarities, whether on purpose or not, who knows? Sometimes a script may linger in a writer's mind for decades before it's penned, so there's no sense in trying to make too much of that. Certainly better than the cartoon cutouts of movies like Big Red One and Bastards.A mixture of many war film elements should satisfy everyone, and this passes all the tests. Will it pass the test of time? Have to wait 100 years to find out.","

The Americans, although on the side of the justice and righteousness, were equally ugly and disgusting on the battlefield. Unfortunately, the last 30 minutes of the movie tried to turn it into a heroic story, which was not in accordance with the first 90 minutes and became a political propaganda of USA.","

"ArchonCinemaReviews","3 December 2014","We're going to be doing one thing, and one thing only: killin' Nazis.Whoops, wrong movie! Brad Pitt stars and leads the expertly cast David Ayer feature film Fury. Told toward the end of the war, Fury is a sufficiently good war movie but unfortunately is underwhelming, at no fault of its own.Don 'Wardaddy' Collier, played by Brad Pitt, is the battle-hardened army sergeant leading a Sherman tank and his crew through German warfare in 1945. His platoon has been together for over three years and fighting Germans across three countries, and he made a promise to keep them alive. A rookie soldier, played by Logan Lerman, is enlisted to join their group and promptly disrupts the accord. American forces are outnumbered and outgunned but they soldier on against overwhelming odds to strike at the heart of Nazi Germany.Writer/Director David Ayer's script and film Fury of 2014 is typical of an Ayer production. It features subtly nuanced archetypes of the hyper-masculine male in a high intensity environment that does not romanticize the violence experienced when in said circumstances.Fury itself is especially well researched and transports the viewer to the horrors of American warfare of the second World War against Nazi Germany. The plot of Fury is a journey across the German landscape through the end of the war. It is also a journey of the characters as they are transformed by the combat battles of war. Ayer also utilizes his direction of the cinematography for beautiful but brutal shots to differentiate Fury from the more sentimental WWII films. Besides these key aspects and the notable first thirty minutes of Fury, the film is about as cliché as possible when it comes to a period-piece war film.Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal all do a commendable job as the weary soldiers. However, the characters are nothing new and are even roles they themselves have previously portrayed. This just exacerbates the stale sense of the film. With almost 70 years passing since the end of WWII, Fury is not distinctive enough to elevate the film above its predecessors.Fury (2014) is a good and entertaining film that will please viewers, especially the untapped male audience who will especially be engaged with the film.For more reviews of RECENT RELEASES, check out our WEBSITE.","

"hiebertkj","17 October 2014","I had high hopes that Fury might end the dry spell of good WWII movies. I could have forgiven the checklist of war movie clichés Fury manages to work in had it not been for a laughable final battle more akin to something from The Expendables than a serious war movie. The final battle consists of scenes where a battalion of seasoned SS soldiers run back and forth through our heroes' machine gun fire, only stopping when it is time for a forced emotional exchange inside the tank. While the director chose to have every other enemy brandish an anti-tank weapon in the ominous lead-in to the final battle, for some reason only three of them are fired, two which miss at unrealistically close range. The ridiculousness of it all turned me into that obnoxious movie goer that laughs out loud during what should be a serious and emotional scene. On the positive side it does manage the singular achievement of most war movie clichés fit into two hours:Kill a German officer on horseback - checkChristian singing hymns - checkMexican crew member made fun of for speaking Spanish - check Hardened leader with a unknown pre-war history who has a private emotional breakdown - checkYoung replacement who struggles to fit in with seasoned veterans but wins them over in the end - checkSoldier falls in love with local girl only to watch her die - check A final mission with impossible odds - checkMoment of doubt when facing certain death but where everyone decides to stick together in the face of certain death - checkRetarded enemy is almost defeated only to remember how to do war, and only after our team has completed their emotional bonding and character development - checkOne member escapes death against all odds-checkEnemy soldier shows mercy by not revealing hiding soldier - check....and many many many more.","

"bobsgrock","21 October 2014","In this post 9/11 era, war has reinvented itself as a morally righteous act, no matter the outcome or manner in which it is executed. The movies have reinforced this notion with films like Fury, a World War II adventure attempting to scale the heights of Saving Private Ryan or Platoon though ultimately regressing to its own variation of gratuitous carnage and destruction. Such films seem to have a chip on their shoulders; how does one portray an event so ubiquitous to modern culture and so thoroughly researched by historians as to give us a new angle and understanding of the dimensions of such an atrocious existence? This answer may never be reached, although Fury does make a noble endeavor to proclaim the bravery and courage of the American military, in this case the US Armored Division.Writer-director David Ayer, who has progressed from writing pulpy action scripts like The Fast and the Furious and S.W.A.T. to those of a more serious tone, nevertheless cannot seem to forget his roots as an action first, character second kind of filmmaker. Ayer has constantly focused on the 'brotherhood' of his characters, but that may be all he has to say about them. The four men occupying the tank in this film say they have been together since the Allied invasion of Africa, yet little else is mentioned about this. Furthermore, the script borrows far too much material outright from Saving Private Ryan, right down to the main characteristics of the main roles. Brad Pitt's Wardaddy is the quiet, unspoken father figure whose troops are willing to die with him (just like Tom Hanks). Shia LaBeouf is the Bible-quoting gunman who seems to have almost supernatural-like aim (just like Barry Pepper). And Logan Lerman is the young, totally inexperienced new addition to the tank who has not been trained for such an assignment but ultimately proves himself through a baptism of fire (just like Jeremy Davies). Does Ayer believe most of those who go to see this will have never seen Spielberg's earlier film, or does he simply not care about the similarities? It may be that he feels the message of such a story overrides any other details, ultimately rendering them unnecessary and minimal. However, other sequences are either taken directly from Saving Private Ryan and other such films, or seem to have little to no basis in reality or logic. One that many will call to mind is when Wardaddy and the newly hired Norman invade a German apartment after taking the town. They stake out the room, find two young women, force them to cook breakfast until the rest of the tank crew, drunk and disorderly, barge in and cause discomfort and awkwardness. What does Ayer believe this sequence says about the relationship between American soldiers and German civilians? The film says nothing, although given the manner in which it is shot, this seems to be a badge of honor rather than a criticism. Whatever the director's attitude towards such scenarios, the actors certainly give their fullest involvement. Pitt has ensured his lasting stardom through roles like this: brash, tough, yet endearing to the younger generation looking up to him. LaBeouf, for the first time in quite awhile, shows his true acting ability when he can remain focused and under control. His role is not huge but he plays it as serious and focused as can be expected. Lerman may be the weakest link, overreaching in his portrayal of an inexperienced, frightened clerk thrust into the deepest and ugliest recesses of the battlefront. He has his tough moments to be sure, but ultimately becomes somewhat cartoonish. The strongest aspect of the film is its action sequences, which may be all Ayer and audiences will care about or take from watching the film. Certainly they leave one completely entranced and utterly aghast. The showdown between our beloved American tank and an advanced German Panzer is fully engrossing and great fun to watch. Yet, is it supposed to be this enjoyable? The final sequence as well shows our heroes surrounded by an SS brigade trapped in their broken-down tank as they attempt to fight their way out, willing to die but only by taking as many Germans with them as possible. Such scenes ultimately begin to feel like video game set-ups. We cheer quietly and feel relieved at the sight and sound of every enemy soldier whose head explodes or is cut down by bullets at such a speed as to look like a fight scene from Star Wars. The greatest difference between Ayer and Steven Spielberg is that Spielberg never tries to excite the viewer through carnage. He is able to do this with less emphasis on grotesque shots of mutilated bodies and fiery crashes and more of a focus on the psychological and spiritual effects of war on the individual. Fury, for all its artistic merit and genuine entertainment, would rather bombard the audience with gore than invite a thought-provoking stimulus. For Ayer, the humanity of war remains out of reach, or perhaps not near at all. This film ultimately tells us war is hell; such a statement is one of the great understatements of history. Will future war films, with all the knowledge and understanding of hindsight at their fingertips, ever give us more than such a simplistic denouement or a visual repetition of events which need not be pounded into the brain?","

"anaconda-40658","16 December 2015","Fury (2014): Dir: David Ayer / Cast: Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Pena, Jon Bernthal: World War 2 is heading to its end but not before one last battle. The theme is the tanks either in America or Germany. Brad Pitt plays Wardaddy, who leads a small troop into Germany in a tank knowing it could be their death. This is a similar role to his Inglourious Basterds role yet done with less confidence because he is fully aware that he may not come out. Shia LaBeouf plays a character by the name of Bible because he can quote it and live it. His biggest test comes when applying his faith to those on the verge of death. Logan Lerman has the most complex role as a young typist brought in to replace a soldier on Wardaddy's team who was killed. Lerman is no soldier and is literally forced to shoot a captured Nazi. He will eventually hit his mark in the heat of battle. One of the quieter scenes involves Pitt and Lerman in the home of two German women whom are treated with hospitality when Pitt provides eggs for them to cook, and Lerman has sex with the younger one. Michael Pena is part of the troop and struggles with alcohol. Jon Bernthal plays the cynical hot headed soldier whose actions towards Lerman are harsh until one pivotal moment where he confronts his own actions. Directed by David Ayer who previously made End of Watch and Street Kings, both of which regard their own wars. Structure seems to be one battle after another but the action is exhilarating with explosive images outside the confines of a tank. The wages of war is death, even after survival when the fury passes and all one can do is wait. Score: 9 / 10","

"writers_reign","24 October 2014","... which is still out as I write this. Clearly writer-director has either no concept of or else no respect for Back Story, for he gives us a leading who is American and 1) fluent in German and 2) has a pathological hatred of Germans to the extent that he practically orgasms each time he kills one - or, in most cases - several. At one point he speaks of killing Germans in North Africa, Italy, France, Belgium and now - it is April, 1945 - in Germany itself. This makes it reasonable to assume he either enlisted or was conscripted around January, 1942 and thus has been a US soldier for roughly three and a half years; it would not be too difficult for a reasonably intelligent person to acquire SOME German in that amount of time and under those circumstances but not to become fluent. The character is not depicted as someone intellectually gifted or even someone who has been to college so we must assume German parentage or at least a fairly strong German connection. In the same way a soldier who has spent three and a half years in active combat will have presumably seen several comrades killed in action and may well develop an intense dislike of the enemy but again this would likely draw the line at pathological hatred. Four of the five-man crew of the tank have been together since North Africa yet none of the others displays the same hatred. In addition these men are Americans not English and the Germans never invaded or bombed America. It would be much more logical and credible for an American serviceman to hate the Japanese who actually destroyed the US fleet in a cowardly and clandestine attack than the Germans. These cavils to one side the film is well made and well acted with even a clumsy attempt to show another side of the lead character. At one point this man and his assistant driver enter a house inhabited by two nubile German women (albeit one is played by a Roumanian actress). The commander encourages his assistant and the younger of the girls to take themselves off into the bedroom and in response to the raised eyebrows of the older girl he says 'they are young, and alive'. He makes no attempt to molest the older girl and when, some time later, the other three members of the tank crew turn up and clearly intend to rape one or both of the girls he makes it clear they will answer to him if they do so. Ayers seems to be saying that 1) war is essentially pointless - in April, 1945 the war was, to all intents and purposes, over, with one month to go, yet instead of throwing in the towel and losing gracefully, the remnants of the German army fight on as though there was still everything to play for - and 2) that war is not only brutal but it also brutalises those who take part in it. Chances are both things are true but we have, Mr. Ayers, known that for some time now.","

"ZChrisJ1995","28 October 2014","While nowhere near as good as it obvious influences, such as 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'All Quiet on the Western Front', 'Fury' is still an effective and competent entry in the war genre, aided by its talented cast and intense, harrowing battle sequences.'Fury' follows the five-man crew of the titular tank as they travel across Nazi Germany during the later days of WWII, focusing on the atrocities they encounter, and sometimes generate themselves. Though the performances of all five primary actors are great, the two that stood out for me were Logan Lerman as Norman, who gradually evolves from an inexperienced typist to a battle-hardened warrior, and Joe Bernthal as Grady, a brutish, ill-tempered loader who constantly mumbles. Brad Pitt does his usual leading man gig without difficulty, and Shia LaBeouf and Michael Peña aren't given enough screen time, but work well with what they're given. The film's numerous set pieces are brilliantly choreographed and stylised but claustrophobic and intense at the same time. The scenes in which Fury's crew take on a German Tiger, as well as its stand against 300 Nazi soldiers, are some of the most effective I've seen in recent years. Like many of its forebears, 'Fury' strives the capture the insanity and chaos of war, not only that created by the 'enemy in the distance' but also by Allied fighters. Just as Nazi soldiers are displayed gunning down civilians, in several scenes Fury's crew harasses German citizens and coldly executes captured unarmed soldiers. In contrast, there are other scenes where not only Fury's crew, but also German soldiers, are seen acting selflessly. The message would appear to be that war can bring out both the worst and the best in people, regardless of their affiliation. Sure, it doesn't have as much emotional impact as say 'Apocalypse Now' or 'Platoon' in this revisionist, attemptedly unbiased approach, but 'Fury' still manages to be a hard-hitting, perfectly acceptable modern war film that doesn't shy away from portraying its protagonists in a morally ambiguous light.","

"grantss","23 October 2014","Good, but not great, WW2 movie. Written and directed by David Ayer, who gave us the brilliant End of Watch, plus the reasonably good Harsh Times, and wrote Training Day, you expect good plot, good action and, most of all, character depth. The action scenes are great - pretty much straight out of the Steven Spielberg/Saving Private Ryan/Band of Brothers school of realistic war action. Suitably gory, yet not gratuitously so.Plot is OK, but not brilliant. Some sub-plots feel contrived and the final scenes seem overly gung ho, sentimental...and very predictable and unoriginal. Furthermore, some scenes are very clumsily done, and/or plain unnecessary. (The tank's Commander and Assistant Driver in the women's apartment was the best example of this - has me squirming the whole time and it seemed to last forever).Moreover, the character depth Ayer built up in End of Watch is lacking here. Yes, there is some character depth, but it seems superficial. In End of Watch you ended up caring so much for both cops and couldn't imagine anything happening to them. In Fury you hardly get to know them - only the tank commander and assistant driver and then only to a limited extent. Makes you feel less engaged with regard to what happens to them.In keeping with the lack of dimension to the characters, the performances feel a bit wooden. Brad Pitt is OK in the lead role, but his performance lacked something. Similarly, Shia LaBeouf is OK, but his character is overly stereotyped. Logan Lerman probably gives the most convincing performance of the movie, as the rookie Assistant Driver.Overall, an exciting and entertaining movie. If more time was spent getting us to care about the characters, and less time on unnecessary, clumsy scenes, this would have been a brilliant movie.","

"PWNYCNY","21 October 2014","In terms of sheer dramatic intensity, this is an excellent movie. The movie explicitly depicts the brutality of war. In doing so, the movie takes certain literary licenses. First, the movie shows US Army soldiers committing war crimes, specifically the murder of prisoners of war and wanton acts of looting and plundering. The movie also depicts US Army soldiers as being intoxicated, both in and outside of battle, and fraternizing with the enemy. The movie also shows US Army units planning highly risky operations relying on only the flimsiest of intelligence regarding the disposition of the opposing forces who, even at this late stage of the war, are still formidable. Nevertheless, the five principal characters, the crew of the tank, are treated with reverence, and deservedly so. Although isolated, they remain at their post to complete the mission. The heroism of the US soldiers in the European Theatre of Operation is an established historical fact. This movie is a testament to that heroism. Brad Pitt gives a compelling performance as the tank commander Sgt. Collier who so closely identifies with war that he cannot separate himself from the instrument, in this case a tank, through which he acts out his violence. The rest of the cast is also excellent, but this is Pitts' movie and in this movie he is the star.","

"ssra1996","7 October 2020","Every director has their trademark. Michael Bay with explosions, JJ Abrams with lens flares, Tarantino with feet, you get the idea. David Ayer seems to have his niche with employing great casts, a promising concept, and high production value, and squandering it on stale, formulaic direction.
This isn't actually a terrible war movie, I can do a pretty good job of suspending disbelief of the inaccuracies, but what it DOES do right, other war movies have done before, and done better. It was one cliche after another. Even the relatively obscure Saints and Soldiers (a war movie that actually incorporated faith in a seamless way, unlike this one) was more emotional and enticing than Fury, and that was made by a low budget Mormon company.
If you're like me and you're looking for a few hours to kill while you're getting caught up on your laundry, Fury is a good, decently entertaining way to occupy some time. Entirely forgettable, though.","

"jimlacy2003","30 November 2014","Starts out pretty interesting. Captivating for a while.It's ""okay, see this?"", ""war really sucks"". Okay, got that. About 60% was this gritty in your face war reality thing. Probably a little over the top. Okay get on with it already!The part about the German armor being superior, understood. That scene with the Sherman's fighting the Tiger looked like a reenactment from a documentary I saw. Then all of the sudden, the movie took a weird turn that can only happen in Hollywood fantasy land. Went totally surreal, and partially turned into a 70's style Nazi revenge movie.Didn't anyone notice with the German column that about every third solider was carrying a panzerfaust (German anti-tank rocket) over their shoulder. What a continuity/story error! When the German's arrive they are noticeably missing them. I guess on the way they neatly packed them into crates because the commander says ""sneak these over and shoot that tank, this is all we have left!"". On top of that there were what looked like at least a dozen of them.Really? The Panzerfaust were not like the crappy British PIAT spring launcher models. One would have been enough through the back of a standing still tank (even one PIAT).Actually the whole thing was crazy nonsense at this point. It's a static (not moving) Sherman tank, the men on foot surely could have moved out of the way of the slow rotating turret as they were close and could have avoided the limited arc of the front gun. Apparently these were stereotypical ""dumb"" Germans that thought it would be better to run directly into the path of the machine guns instead.Way to go to kill a movie guys! It's like whom ever wrote this movie ran out of ideas and just gave up with a big heaping handful out of the bag of nonsense, stereotypes, and clichés. I felt insulted; as if everyone was pushed into the sub-moronic IQ level.It's too bad, I really wanted to like this movie. I'll give it some points though for still being entertaining at times.","

"celtic451-228-782719","1 February 2015","Even though I said this may contain spoilers, I will try hard not to write any. I think the writers made a big basic writing mistake: The main characters weren't likable(OK, I kind of liked the ""new guy"" character). They were jerks and bullies and immature acting and I ended up cheering for the Germans hoping they would kill them. And also, one of the main battles was just plain goofy. There were like 200 German soldiers trying to take out one tank, but there were waves of them running in front of the tank one way, then later another wave was running the other way with no real purpose. It looked really stupid. I actually started laughing because they looked like the Keystone Kops. It is just a really bad movie all around with very unlikable characters.","

"CANpatbuck3664","3 July 2016","I was so excited when Fury came out. I loved End of Watch (I still do, I re-visit it often) and seeing a gritty war movie with actors like Brad Pitt, Jon Bernthal and Michael Pena seemed like it was right up my alley. With Suicide Squad (David Ayer's new project) coming up, I decided to watch it again. I think this movie has a lot to offer, it does give an absolutely grimy look at World War 2 combat showing the evils of both sides but it has its flaws too and while I think it's easily one of the better war movies to have been made lately, it falls short of the very best of the genre (Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List just to name a couple).*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We start Fury on a deserted battlefield in Germany. The battle has already ended, the soldiers and the machines of war that remain are lifeless. The year is 1945, the tide of the war has already turned but the Nazi resistance has yet to stop. If anything it has gotten more fanatical for some and that much more desperate. A lone German rider trots across the field, surveying the damage, perhaps looking for survivors. He comes across what looks like an abandoned tank when something leaps from the shadows. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Brad Pitt) tackles the rider and stabs him right through the eye. He lets the horse go and returns to the tank. The tank has merely broken down and his crew is trying to fix it. His crew consists of Coon-Ass (Jon Bernthal), Bible Swan (Shia LaBouef) and Gordo (Michael Pena). There was another member of the crew but his remains will need to be scraped out of the tank when they get back to camp. After Wardaddy wails on Coon-Ass to get it started, the tank roars back to life and they head back to camp.You don't see too many movies about tank crews and one of the best things about Fury is that it's determined to show something different when it comes to WW2 movies. Every war movie shows you combat tactics and the civilian casualties but Fury really dives down into how appalling things got. The remains of soldiers get literally hosed out of tanks, food is traded for sexual services and child soldiers are forcibly recruited and murdered. It's really unpleasant to watch at times, there's a scene where Wardaddy and Norman (Logan Lerman) try to play house with a couple of German girls and it goes terribly. A lot of people complain about that scene and while it is disturbing and uncomfortable, I think it was important for the development of Norman's character and it's so tense you can't look away. We've seen a lot of movies about WW2 and it's a credit to Ayer and his crew for finding a different way to show how things really were.There's a pretty good cast here and while this probably isn't the type of movie that gets people nominated for Oscars, they all perform well. Although this is Norman's story, Brad Pitt is the star of the show. He's got a commanding presence as Wardaddy, he becomes a father figure to Norman over the course of just one day but to Pitt's credit he's never made to be completely likable. He's been through the ringer and he's the type of soldier who does the dirty work (both for the good and the bad) to get things done and Pitt is very good in the role. Logan is solid but he's not given a lot to work with. Norman doesn't have a lot of backstory but Logan is great at looking scared. Bernthal and Pena are both excellent, they're playing the more unlikable members of the crew and you get where they're coming from. The biggest surprise was Shia who was really good as Bible. If anything this movie proves that no matter how crazy he is, when he gets good material and he commits, he's actually a good actor.Getting to the action scenes, most of them are actually really great. You get to see ground assaults (they include the tracer bullet effects which was new to me), short air battles from the ground and actual tank battles. One of my criticisms of Fury is that the action scenes are so good earlier that they kind of point out the implausibilities of the final battle. There's a scene where the crew goes up against a German Tiger tank and it was awesome. The ending just doesn't seem as grounded and while it doesn't ruin the movie, it was a little disappointing.The only other thing that I didn't like was that it the movie took place over one day. The characters that they created were fascinating and I wish I could have seen them play out over a longer period of time (getting to know a little more about them). I get why they did it this way but there's so much in just a short amount of time, spreading it out might have been better.Fury isn't flawless but it is a good entry to the war movie genre. You get to see some different things including how awful the Allied soldiers could be at points compared to how terrible the Nazis could be at the end of the war (coming from Canada you only get the Allied side of the story). You also get to see the atmosphere inside a tank, how claustrophobic and dirty it was. David Ayer's commitment to creating an authentic ""on the ground"" war movie comes through and while it might not be my favourite movie of his (End of Watch), I liked Fury a lot. There's a good cast, a realistic environment and a good story to be told about how the lines of morality get blurry when a World War comes to a close.","

Fast forward eight years and I finally chose to give this another watch... and I have to say I'm glad I did.Setting in the last year of the war Fury follows First Sergeant Don Collier (Brad Pitt) of the 2nd Armored Division and his men. While this film doesn't do much in the way of story it offers some of the best tank battles and war sequences put on film. Both shocasing the destruction and savagery of war. The cinematography was great, the action fantastically shot, and all of it elevated on 4k Blu-ray.A well put together cast with every character offering something unique but all of them suffering from shared traumas of the horrors they faced through the war.Gut punching, disturbing, and at times difficult to watch makes Fury a good well done war film and experience I won't soon forget.IMDb: 8/10

"MovieMystro","4 December 2016","Black Friday Blu-Ray hunting led me to buy this movie. I had never seen it before and usually only buy things that I know are good. A great reminder to at least do your homework before buying anything, even at Black Friday prices.As I read another review here, ""Insulting to both Americans and Germans"" to say the least. This movie is the definition of dour stupidity. It's poorly written and is awfully paced. There are some good, strife-filled performances but certainly a film no one would ever want to watch more than once. It's sole purpose seems to try and link modern fatalistic anti- war sentiments with the past. Thus, it's main goal is to tarnish ""the greatest generation"" or reduce it to millennial BS perceptions. Everything about this movie reeks of a one dimensional tone and one long sour note.","

"airborne_trooper","17 October 2014","There are A LOT of WWII movies out there, some obviously stand the test of time and have become benchmarks in modern film, while others only succeed in doing a disservice to the brave who fought during that war. Fury lands pretty much in the middle if not swaying a bit towards bad. The production design was amazing and really captured the look of war torn Europe during the closing days of the war. Outside of that, this film lacks in almost every category.First and foremost-- the speaking in this film was horrendous. The lingo from that time period is hard enough to understand with people speaking clearly if you're not familiar with the era. The main characters in this film used some of the worst accents I've ever heard. It's safe to say that a good 60% of the film, you can barely discern what's being said.Next was the music, I don't know if the director was going for a dramatic effect, but the score was terrible and way over the top. A well done drama about such an important topic does not need music as a crutch. At times I felt like I was watching a video game.Last but not least, this movie literally had no plot. It went from scene to scene, with none being related to each other in any way at all. One scene takes up a large portion of the film and had nothing to do with the ending at all! There was no character development, no back story. Nothing. I don't even know what Pitt's character's name even was.Bottom line, if you're debating on whether or not to see it, I say save your money. You're not missing much.","

This is great because the movie is suppose to take place near the ending of ww2. There is lots of violence but what else would you expect from a rated R war movie. The acting is great, Shia was the best,John Bernthal and Michael Pena were fantastic. Brad Pitt did a good job playing a leader who has to make decisions that will not please everyone. I was not into Logan Lermans acting that much and there was something about him I disliked. But everyone else was fantastic. Overall the tank battle scenes are fantastic and so is the acting.

"mattchopping-39301","3 February 2023","Fun fact, I did 120 hours of community service at Bovington Tank Museum in the UK where the tanks in this film were sourced (long, non-violent story). This is clearly a source of great pride for the museum, as they have screens inside of it playing Fury continuously on a loop. I had watched the film before my unfortunate spell there, and as I mowed their grounds hour after hour I can't say I was exactly appreciative of the history around me at the time. As I rewatch the film now, I look back on my time eating lunch atop one their many tanks (not the last functioning Tiger in the world shown in the film sadly) and realise how lucky I was to be in a place so abundant with historical relics, aswell as a place so deeply connected to a major Hollywood piece featuring a cast of incredible A-list actors. Nostalgia aside, this is a great little film. Whilst it may be lacking a little in nuance and historical accuracy, it certainly isn't lacking in excitement and gritty brutal action. Watch this already! Bovington museum needs the shout out, and to hire a full time groundskeeper at last!!!","

"bowmanblue","2 April 2015","Okay, so I'm not the biggest fan of war films – my main motivation for watching 'Fury' was that it was filmed in my home town and I wanted to see which bits of my village I recognised! However, I was actually pretty glad I did. I'd heard mixed reviews on Fury – much of the negativity based around how 'unlikeable' the characters are. Well, that may be true, but it was sort of refreshing in a way.'Fury' itself is the name of our 'heroes' tank – part of a battle-worn American division deep inside Germany in the dying months of World War II. Basically, this tank crew (led by Brad Pit) have seen it all (and killed much of it). They aren't particularly nice people. If they once were then the constant slaughter has taken its toll on them and all they know is war. However, when they lose one of their crew a youngster is added to the mix, who doesn't share their particular attitude to the war.I suppose you could say that there's not much story here. It's pretty much one (rather impressive) tank battle after the next. Fury's crew were pretty grim, but seeing as all of them have been fighting it out for years and could be killed any day, I felt that that was kind of understandable under the circumstances. Whatever 'character development' comes from Brad and the 'newbie's' characters. One must learn to 'toughen up' and the other must relearn his sensitivity.It's probably a guy's film, as it does rely on the action scenes to 'wow' audiences. Although, maybe it was just me, but when the machine guns were firing, they kind of looked like either red or green lasers (definitely something out of Star Wars), but that could just be me.About the only time I felt it slowed down was during a scene in the middle of the film. I'm guessing it was meant to emphasis the two main characters and the change in their attitudes, but I felt it did just drag a little longer than it should.Overall, 'Fury' is a good watch, but you'll probably need to be into some pretty dark and bleak war films in order to truly appreciate this.","

"ferguson-6","18 October 2014","Greetings again from the darkness. When a filmmaker takes on WWII, he better have something new to say or a new way to show it. Director David Ayer (highly recommend his End of Watch, 2012) literally takes us inside a Sherman tank with its crew of 5 men, including their leader played by Brad Pitt.Having the tank as a centerpiece brings a level of claustrophobia to the treacherous German war front. The battle scenes are excruciatingly tense, and actually beautifully filmed. This may seem an odd description for a war movie, but bouncing from inside the tank to the German countryside is done with such style that it provides contrast to the brutality and violence of war.Pitt's crew is made up of Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal (especially good). They are forced to take on a rookie with no tank training ... but he can type 60 words per minute. Logan Lerman plays the rookie and he brings the natural sensitivity we've come to expect from his roles in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and Noah. We buy off on the difficult transition since the others have fought campaigns together in Africa, Belgium and France.What works here are the battle sequences. What doesn't really work are the numerous moments of personal drama injected to help us understand how war can change a man ... no matter how hard he tries to hold on to his humanity. The sequence with the two German women, a piano and fried eggs seems especially drawn out and unbelievable. We understand the point pretty quickly, but the extended sequence becomes quite awkward.The most interesting question the movie asks is whether a soldier can be so disgusted and sick of war, yet somehow addicted to the action. Mr. Ayers previously wrote U-571 (2000), so he is clearly interested in the mentality of soldiers in a claustrophobic setting. More of this approach would have been welcome here.","

"midas-jacobs","29 June 2015","Fury is about a group of guys in a tank. But at a certain point they get someone new in This is Norman (Logan Lerman). He has trouble killing people, and being in war. His sergeant has to 'help' him with this. But this is just a side story-line, and I just found that out when he starts killing people in the movie, which I didn't like. The main story is about the sergeant who has to guide a group of tanks through Germany. The movie is directed by David Ayer. I really liked the directing of the movie, they also went with this gray- isch tone. I really like that sort of style. Sometimes it is used right in movies, and sometimes it isn't. An example where it is used right: Gone girl, and THIS MOVIE. The action sequences are very well filmed, only in the beginning of the movie it was a bit fast edited. he acting in the movie was good. I really liked the chemistry between Don and Norman. Logan Lerman did one of his best performances yet. Really liked his character, also Brad Pitt did a good job, but less spectacular. This couple got the best lines and where involved in one of my favorite scenes of the movie (I have two favorite scenes the next one is a bit further in this text) the scene is when Don forces Norman to kill a German soldier, that was a very well written and acted scene by both of the actors. I didn't like Shia that much. I loved Jon Bernthal, you hate him at first, but you grow out loving him, he is also in my other favorite scene is when Emma died and Grady tells Norman that that is war. I also got attached to the characters, so I felt bad, when a lot of them died near the end of the movie. the writing was also pretty good, it wasn't anything amazing, but it was good. This was also done by David Ayer. They manged to replicate a realistic world war. and something I cant forget to mention: this movie is very gruesome, don't trust the parents guide with this one. There is very realistic and gory violence. I trusted the parents guide and I was kind of shocked when I saw the movie, luckily I can handle these parts quite a bit,but if you can't handle gory violence than don't watch the movie.And like I have said in the title of my review, the movie is not what I expected, I expected it to be worse because I have read a lot of negative reviews about this movie. Here are some individual scores, like I usually do:Directing: 8.5/10writing: 8/10Acting: 9/10Tension: 8/10Drama: 9/10 that is a total of 42.5/50 which is rounded an 8 or a 9 out of ten.

Brad Pitt delivers another solid performance, elevating an average movie. While not widely admitted, he is nevertheless one of the greatest actors of his generation and his resume speaks for itself; over the years he's wisely selected some terrific scripts to participate in.

"rtp4242","25 October 2014","Tank Commander Don Collier (Brad Pitt) leads a group of soldiers on a mission to hold a crossroads from a Nazi SS division in 1945. His loyal subordinates have fought with him from Africa to France on D- Day and now into Germany. The veterans, Boyd Swan, (Shia La Bouf) Trini Garcia, (Michael Pena) and Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal) try to break in a new assistant tank driver, Norman Ellison (Logan Lehrman) who used to be a clerk typist before entering combat. Can the tank soldiers hold the crossroads until reinforcements arrive?I have heard that Fury is based on a number of true stories from World War II. If that is the case, the collection of stories seem awfully disjointed, and lacking in continuity. Every movie about WWII had a mission to complete. In Saving Private Ryan, the soldiers try to recover a missing soldier, in the Great Escape, a group of allied POW's try to escape a Nazi POW camp, In Stalag 17, the allies try to uncover a Nazi spy in their midst, and probably the best of these is Band of Brothers, which follows the exploits of Easy Company the first parachute infantry regiment during World War II. There is no mission here, no cohesive story, the soldiers just hop from mission to mission, with seemingly no rhyme or reason. It's supposed to be a character study, but the characters are paper thin. Pitt is the leader of the group, but why do these soldiers follow him around through the whole war, and why are they willing to lay their lives on the line for him. The rest of the characters are little more than stereotypes, Swan spouts scripture at every turn, which is an insult to a true Christian. Garcia is a loutish Hispanic character, Grady Travis is the stereotypical Hollywood redneck, which is an insult to Southern people. And Lehrman is the new guy being put through the requisite amount of hazing before being accepted by the group. To top it off, the ending is shockingly unrealistic. If it wanted to concentrate on how muddy, and filthy and bloody war is they succeeded, but again, what kind of story do they want to tell, a heroic war story or a gritty anti-war war movie? The length of the movie, is far too long, and one scene, where the soldiers hold two women prisoner, encapsulates the problem. The scene goes on and on, and doesn't provide any insight to these men, or why they behave they way they do. 2 hours and 14 minutes is horrendously long for a movie with seemingly no point.The acting is underwhelming. Pitt gives a dull, listless performance, and expects the audience to follow him regardless. It's like he's saying, ""I'm a star, that's why you should spend 2+ hours watching me."" Sorry, that's not good enough. After two lackluster performances in 12 Years A Slave, and World War Z, I'm beginning to have serious doubts about Pitt's acting ability. He is capable of giving a good performance, he did give a great performance in Inglorious Basterds, ironically a World War II movie. Logan Lehrman gives the best performance, but the character is so hackneyed and clichéd, that it's hard to appreciate his performance. Shia La Bouf easily gives the most insincere performance of his life as a Bible thumping evangelical, and Michael Pena should be ashamed of the lines he has to say. If I want a sermon, I'll go to church, if I want a negative Latino stereotype, I'll watch John Leguizamo.There is one scene with outstanding cinematography, unfortunately it's the first scene, and then the rest of the movie is filled with a dull sepia imbued film. This is undoubtedly done for effect, but instead of illustrating an uplifting tone, it adds to a depressing tone. The pacing is slow and ponderous, much like a tank ride though Germany. The story meanders for a long time, before trying to build to an exciting ending. It doesn't.For more Pitt-thy reviews visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com.","

"martinrobertson300482","23 November 2014","""Fury"" is a brutal, action packed and well acted war movie that might not be one for those wanting an old fashioned heroic epic. But will thrill those looking for an explosive action film that has the guts to sometimes be as harsh as a real war can no doubt be. Think of it as ""Saving Private Ryan."" But without the perhaps unrealistically friendly heroes.What makes ""Fury"" stand out that little bit more is the fact that a majority of the film takes place in a tank. Its not so much about the soldiers running around with guns as it the ones trapped together in the shady darkness of a tank. Though it branches out to show us the disaster that's happening around these characters as well.Its not a completely offencive action movie either. A lot of war movies can perhaps cheapen war. But ""Fury"" makes you think about how brutal these kind of situations are. With actors that were apparently put through the paces to make the whole thing look as legit as possible. Brad Pitt is as good always. But its perhaps the other stars that shine through. I've always like what Jon Bernthal (Shane from ""The Walking dead"" can do) but even Shia LaBeouf was fantastic in this, and Logan Lerman is no doubt a young star in the making after this.","

"angelsunchained","28 April 2016","I liked the action in this film and the acting, however the story line was way over the top for a story which supposedly was happening during World War II. American soldiers are shown to be crazed psycho killers. They enjoy killing so much that they laugh and cheer every time they kill someone. Also, they kill everyone including surrendering soldiers. When they seize a town, they become ""mad hatters"", blowing up pianos, wearing gold chains and top hats, dancing around in the streets like a band of wild savages. The feel of the film is the area is not the 1940s, but the late 1960s when Viet Nam was lost and drugged out soldiers ran wild, or maybe not. Hollywood has a way of making ""Joe Public"" believe that a movie shows real life. But, this movie was a major hit, Brad Pitt is great, so who cares if it is realistic or not. It is a movie, nothing more and nothing less. For some action entertainment, I rate it a 7 out of 10. If you want to see a realistic World War II movie, see a Walk In The Sun with Dana Andrews.","

"Hunt2546","17 October 2014","The annoyance of this picture is the stupidity of some of the criticism. A Brit moron has already complained it doesn't show any Brits. Hello, chauvinist assclown, how many Brits were there in the Second Armored Division? As many as there were Yanks in the Battle of Britain. What utter stupidity. As for the film itself it's probably one of the best evocations ever of the squalor, waste, horror,filth, fear and general nastiness of war. An American Sherman , Second Armored Division style, rolls across Germany. The war's almost over, but people still die in the hideous hundreds every day and missions are only accomplished in blood expenditure. The central image, almost a lietmotif, is a closeup of a trank tread crushing through anything in its path. That's war: huge, brutal, sloppy, unfeeling, destructive. A crew calls their vehicle FURY and goes about business with weary, frightened but determined professionalism. The new guy is too tender for this rough treatment, but he learns. The Sergeant treats him with tough love. Meanwhile, everywhere, people keep getting blown up or set on fire. The lucky ones get a shot in the head. Real tanks are used, so the sense of them has hulking tractors of war is intense, and the movie creates combat more pursuasively than anything since ""Private Ryan."" (But wait? Where were the Brits on Omaha beach! Why it's a crime Spielberg didn't show them!) Some reviewers, with great talent for missing the argument, say all the guys are stereotypes, but that's the point, not the mistake: war grinds you to your elemental self. You cease to be who you were and become this new animal, tired, scared and, as the greatest generation happily proved, willing to serve and die despite the misery of the ordeal.","

"FallsDownz","25 October 2014","Fury is a movie about World War 2 that has a lot of famous actor like Brad Pitt , Shia LaBeouf , Logan Lerman or Jon Bernthal and they're all in the same team together in the movie which makes it kind a interesting .David Ayer the director and writer in this movie doing one thing really good and that is the feel of the war , it's intense it's brutal it's about people killing each other and i have to give him the credit.He also directed the action scene pretty well even though it's just look fake and too much heroic but it's fun and entertaining.But other than that the movie just falls flat , the plot is just mediocre and predictable and the characters is just meh i mean the movie try to make us care about them but the problem is they're just a bunch of a-hole which makes it's hard for me to even liked them and the movie doesn't give enough time to tell their background which makes the characters even worst they fell bland and i didn't care them that much even though i have to say that Shia LaBeouf show really good performance in this movie.Overall Fury is just another WW2 movie that fun to watch but that's it you will not remember it in the end of the year because it's does nothing new at all and the characters and plot just too mediocre and bland to actually make us memorable.","

"Snorreplop","13 January 2015","Sergeant Don Collier aka Wardaddy is the commander of a Sherman tank named Fury and its diverse crew. Situated in the last days of the second world war the allied forces are confronted with the last fanatical resistance of the German forces. Allied troops are facing low morale confronted with the absurdities and pointlessness of war.After the Fury turns back as the sole remainder of a mission, a green soldier has been assigned to join the crew to replace a fallen comrade. Soon the crew is on the road again and after some skirmishes send to protect a crossroads from an overwhelming enemy force, to prevent a slaughter of nearby unarmed allied army personnel.This war drama is gritty and raw without much humor. It made me feel uncomfortable at times, but not in a good way. Particularly the rookie initiation and dinner at the Germans scenes felt wrong and awkward. To sum it all up: Fury is a solid war movie with a nice cast and too few actual tank battle sequences.","

"Figgy66-915-598470","25 October 2014","25 October 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Not since Saving Private Ryan have I been to see a war film that has had my attention from start to finish. Fury is the story of a battle weary US tank crew, fighting deep in Germany towards the end of the Second World War. A new, and very young soldier called Norman joins their team, trained as a clerk and totally unprepared for any of what is to follow, he is pushed very hard for the sake of his own survival and that of the team. Given the horrific subject that is any war, this film, aided by it's excellent epic score, was a magnificent portrayal of life on the wrong side of the front line and how the soldiers look out for each other. It is not for the faint hearted, and indeed one person walked out before we were halfway through, but these are stories that need to be told to make sure future generations never forget what these people went through for the sake of our freedom. As expected blood was flowing freely and the cast of extras must have run into many hundreds. Brad Pitt played the part of Sergeant 'Wardaddy' with a compassion and sensitivity you wouldn't expect from this kind of film and his character held his team together, sometimes on a very thin thread, but commanded the kind of loyalty you only find in extreme situations. Not for the faint hearted but a cracking good film.","

"MattBirk","17 March 2016","David Ayer creates what is probably the best war movie of 2014. Fury is a gritty look at the life of a group of men confined in a single tank and their struggle for survival. Clearly a crazy life and for just about anyone it would be a very difficult life to have, but these few men make it work. Brad Pitt is definitely the highlight of the film, bring not only his men together but the garrison of other tanks during battle. While together in the tank they are a solid, fighting unit worthy of your admiration, but outside the tank 3/5 men are complete fools and it's hard to look past how obnoxious they are. So we are left with only 2 men, the new member, and Don, but Don shows his true colors when he executes an unarmed man (I completely lost faith in his character after that scene). And then the kid, unfortunately, doesn't receive enough backstory to make him seem like the 'innocence' character they want him to be portrayed as. Also, the movie would have been far more effective if it didn't go all out crazy with its climax, becoming too over the top for its own good. But outside of these flaws, the movie feels authentic and real in a sense and totally shows the horrors of war. But in the end, the movie will probably just be remembered as 'that tank movie with Brad Pitt'.","

"foulds72","27 October 2014","If you want to know about the war, then watch the amazing 'World At War' documentary series.If the point of this film was, as so many other reviews have said, to demonstrate the carnage, pain and suffering or war, then why is there no real context to any of the action.Why is Brad Pitt's body in one piece when the Germans explode 2 grenades at his feet, inside his tank.Why does a crack SS battalion continually commit suicide by walking in front of the machine guns of the crippled tank (instead of walking round the back) Why did the Yanks leave the spare machine gun ammunition on the outside of the tank when preparing the ambush? I know, it was so Brad could look heroic and get shot trying to retrieve it.The SS troops fired 2 or 3 RPG type rockets at the tank, caused damage and killed one of the men, then stopped firing them.The premise of keeping the crossroads was ridiculous. Anyone could just have walked through the adjacent fields if they wanted to get past.This film has pretensions of being a serious movie and the cinematography/soundtrack etc. are very well done, but the whole thing just lacks any reality or validity.","

"ironhorse_iv","2 November 2014","Fury is an intense film that use war to no clear beyond showing how ugly it can be. It's no way, go overblown patriotic like 1998's Saving Private Ryan does with its music. It doesn't romanticism the war like 2001's Pearl Harbor with its story. It's doesn't make war, an easier sit, acting somewhat like a propaganda film like 2009's Inglourious Basterds does. It's a very dark film with a lot of dark subject matter. It was a hard seat at times. I just glad, it didn't go too far into the horrors, to the point that it makes it really unwatchable like certain war films like 1995's 'Men Behind the Sun 4' or 2008's 'The Downfall of Berlin: Anonyma' due to the repulsion, nihilism nature. This movie belong in the same category as 2001's 'Enemy at the Gate' or 1985's 'Come and See'. It find a reasonable balance. It doesn't turn away audience members away due to the repulsion of war nor does it seem inaccurate or clueless to the horror of war. Directed by David Ayer, Fury is a fictional film about a battle-hardened army sergeant named Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt) whom commands a Sherman tank and her five-man crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines during the last days of World War 2 Germany. The film draws a composite portrait of tank crews and the final days of the war in Europe by using stories influenced by the service of veterans in his family and by reading books such as Belton Y. Cooper's Death Traps about American WW2 tank warfare. Ayer went to considerable lengths to seek authentic uniforms and weapons which fitted the final months of the war in Europe. He even got the rare Tiger 131, the last surviving operational Tiger I to portray the enemy tank. It is the first time since the 1946 film 'Theirs Is the Glory' that a real Tiger tank and not a prop version has been used on a film set. While some things are not historically accurate for a story set in 1945, the film is accurate enough. Still, there are a few inaccurate things, clichés, and tropes that anybody can nitpick on. As for story, the movie wasn't giving anything new to the table; after all, there has been hundreds of films like this, previously done before. The third act is basically Saving Private Ryan with tanks. While the plot of the film is fictional, the depiction of the tank Fury and its commander, parallels the experience of several real allied tankers such as the American tank commander Staff Sergeant Lafayette G. Pool. The action scenes mirror that of the real life Battle of Crailsheim fought in Germany in April 1945. The action scenes were pretty intense and gory, but it was indeed scale down compare to those of other epic war movies. What the movie does well is using the story of the transition of cavalry to mechanized warfare. A lot of horse symbolism. The horses symbolize over the course of the film is the difference between European WWII movies and their American counterparts. People don't realize that the German army was like mostly horse-drawn at the time. By the end of the war it was mostly horse-drawn, and there's an innocence about a horse. A horse doesn't know where it is or why it fighting. In a way, all of the horse slaughtering can represent the youth of the two countries. When, they talk about what they've done to all of those horses, and it's very significant in foreshadowing when they let one go. Lots of Christianity motifs. Just like the Bible, it is filled with harrowing violence, inhumanity, corrupted and fallen men, and a message of God's grace. The movie is a very raw film. Lots of tense drawn out lingering nerve biting moments. Some good examples are the scene where Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) was forced to kill an unarmed prisoner of war in the back & the frightening sexual vibe of the scene with German women where you don't know if they wanted to rape them or not. It doesn't help that song playing in the background at that scene is 'Virgin Slumber Song.' The biggest change to the WWII motif is the idea of brotherhood. In this movie, they really mistreat each other, both physical and mentally. This movie was no lovely dove bromance, 2001 Band of Brothers. The tank crew honest could had kill each other, any moment. All of the actors well-acted in this film. Before filming, Ayer required the actors to undergo a four-month preparation process, where it broke them down. He kept the actors to cold, exhausted, and miserable while filming. Ayer also pushed the cast to physically spar each other, leading to many black eyes and bloody noses. They insulted each other with personal attacks as well. On top of that, the actors were forced to live in the tank together for an extended period of time where they ate, slept, and defecated. It was pretty ruthless. Maybe, too ruthless, as one of the co-stars, Shia LaBeouf went a little bit crazy, and pulled out his own tooth, cut his own face and refused to shower in order to understand what his character would have been through. It really did angering much of the cast and crew that day. The film also caused controversy by shooting a scene on Remembrance Day in which extras wore Nazi uniforms, in which the filmmakers had to make an apology. The movie is beautiful shot. The opening shot, alone, has this Lawrence of Arabia feel to it. Then you got a lot of haunting scenes. Overall, Fury is a well-made depiction of the horrors of war that will keep you at the edge of your seat watch.","

"kosmasp","31 May 2015","Or wherever the road takes them of course. What a movie though? The ""intro"" itself sets the tone. This is grim and not for the faint hearted at all. There is graphic violence and the war situation is depicted as not heroic. You could argue that we get a couple of clichés thrown in for good measure, but overall the acting and the story are able to bind you and keep you at the edge of your seat.The characters show off a couple of side, not all are or could be considered ""good"". But that's the ""reality"" of war. Actually I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people despise Brad Pitts character ... only to sympathize with him a couple of moments later. To be able to make transitions like that speaks of the acting, but also the script at hand here. A really good anti-war movie, that is as gritty as they come","

"timbermisc","27 October 2014","If you would read the reviews that give 5 stars or less, you will obtain a more realistic view of this movie. The story shows an American tank crew headed across Europe in Germany during the last week of the WWII. It is April of 1945. This crew is multi-racial and it displays some of their conflicts with one another and their surroundings and German survivors of the War.The tank is disabled by a land mine. Two Hundred Germans, likely SS soldiers are marching towards the disabled American tank. The Americans have time to load up and transfer all of the extra stored ammunition which is hanging carried on the outside of their tank to the inside of the tank before the Germans come. They do not haul inside the ammunition until 200 Germans are shooting at them at close range. Hiding and running would have been a rational choice given that the War is about to end within 5-11 days. But Brad Pitt chooses to stand and fight. I mean, the Americans and Russians are overwhelming Berlin in April 1945. What would you do?Similar to a Rambo movie, the protagonists in the tank choose to do a stand-off while cowering holed up against 200 enemy soldiers who surround the tank. They could have hidden in the bushes; there was time, but no, they choose to stay in their disabled tank to ""stay with the Sergeant"" Brade Pitt. This means sure death for them. The Germans could have starved the Yanks out. Or waited until they wanted to go to the restroom. Then you shoot them with sniper fire as they get tired of smelling ""it"".The Germans do not seek cover against the firing machine guns of the tank. Rather, they run back and forth in front of the tank's blazing machine guns. I suppose the Germans are attracted to the firing machine guns like mosquitoes are attracted to heat and light. And this may be why the Germans lost WWII.The Germans put two hand grenades down the tank's top porthole. There is a hatch at the bottom of the tank for the Americans to escape. There is time for one soldier to wiggle out of the tank before the grenades explode. And he does this. All others, including Brad Pitt, are killed by the grenades. So, why didn't the soldier simply grab the grenades and hurl them out of the tank through the bottom porthole which was wide open? That would have taken 3 seconds per grenade and perhaps he could have made it, saving his team mates. The grenades have about a 5-6 second fuse delay.Then shortly afterward, an SS officer sees the alive soldier below the tank hiding alive and well. He doesn't shoot him. What does the SS soldier think the soldier is beneath the tank? He doesn't order him away from the tank. The SS soldier just leaves him alive without saying a word to him. I mean, who would be under a tank after a firefight?There is abusiveness by one American soldier to another who is new to combat. This is a kind of ""hazing"". Oh boy, adding ""realism"". He pulls on the ears of this new soldier. This abusive soldier handles the soldier in various ways to aggravate the new soldier. Doesn't it occur to the audience that in combat --you do this to a soldier and you could be ""shot by accident"" in the next firefight? Oh, yes, there is a scene with a blown up face sitting on a shelf in the tank. The 1/3 face has no scratches on it, and the eye is perfectly in the socket of the piece-of-face. How could an eye remain the eye socket after the head has exploded from an anti-tank round?If you will read the criticisms of other reviewers, the ones with 1 or 2 star reviews, they will detail more story errors.This movie is not a ""Saving Private Ryan"" level show. It shows soldiers taking unnecessary risks and then making bad tactical decisions. And that is what Rambo did. Rambo stood up to the enemy straight up and fired his machine gun from the hip. In real life he would last 3 seconds. And this is why returning Vietnam veterans were highly critical of Rambo and John Wayne movies. These movies give the viewer a false sense of security. You know what: If you have fears, it may be because you really are in danger. And if you want to live, you might be better off making like a mole. Yes, the grungy scenery, and the sleazy actor's lines may give this movie a sense of ""realism""; a tired soldier's viewpoint. But the macro view of this drama portrays unrealistic command decisions and motivations which may be acceptable in a video game only. To give this show a high rating is a disservice to critical viewers of IMDb ratings.I recommend movies like ""Come and See"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Platoon"", ""Das Boot"" for war movies.I suppose this movie was made without any consultation with real Tank veterans. But one plus of the movie is that it has a real ""Tiger Tank"" in it being driven around.So, go see this movie, but don't start thinking about all the unrealistic issues with it. If it makes you feel lucky to live in a Country not at war, then it has a positive purpose in your life. And it might make you feel further grateful to those tank crews that fought during WWII.So, this movie is 1/2 good, and 1/2 technically bad. It is more ""grinding"" than inspiring. ""B"" movie fits the description of this film.","

"stevenfreekin","24 September 2015","I really enjoyed this movie. The ensemble cast was terrific. David Ayer delivered with this film, which was actually shot on film, and it's his best film since End of Watch. His last film Sabotage was well...garbage. In this film we experience WWII from inside a tank, it's pretty grimy, filthy, gritty, and excruciatingly edgy. I would say this film is like The Alamo inside a tank. Yeah, it's that awesome.What i really appreciated with this film is that i was absorbed and immersed in the movie to the point where i wasn't aware i was viewing a movie at all, but simply an unspoken member of the team inside the tank. This happened because they avoided using the annoying, cliché, over-used hand-held camera crap that's ubiquitous today. The classical cinematography made it more realistic, raw, suspenseful, and tough to the point where you can almost smell the odor of the men and the dirt.Great job to the whole crew and cast of this marvelous motion picture.

"Quinoa1984","4 November 2014","I have to wonder if Fury had been made by, I don't know, Sam Peckinpah or Robert Aldrich or George Roy Hill or someone if it might be more effective or memorable. Of course, those guys have been gone for years, and David Ayer seems to want to aspire to those filmmaker's heights of having real 'macho' male cinema on a grand Hollywood scale with blood and guts and camaraderie for the characters and all. Fury is more ambitious for this director than some of his past work - think Hard Times with Christian Bale or even End of Watch, which had a wonderful script and performers amid some terrible direction - and he clearly put a lot of heart and soul in to it. Sadly, there's some Hollywood Movie-BS as well.This isn't to say the premise isn't intriguing, and one we might have not seen quite this way, though there have been countless WW2 flicks: a young man, basically untrained outside of clerical work (Lerman) is assigned to the 'Fury' tank led by Brad Pitt and including the likes of Shia LaBeouf (rocking a mean mustache), Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal, and among them he is by far the greenest of the lot. The men don't like him that much - the beginning of the film shows one of their men has just died, which is why they need a replacement - but have no choice as they plunge ahead in Germany near the end of the war.The problems with the story come from familiarity, and lots of it. It's hard, for example, if you have seen Saving Private Ryan to not see the similarity with Jeremy Davies joining Tom Hanks' bunch in that film. This time Ayer ups the sort of 'horror' quotient of war, like Pitt's Sgt making Lerman's character shoot a captured German soldier and it becoming a whole big thing. It's tough to watch, but more-so because it feels too melodramatic, even for a war film. Of course Pitt's character has his reasons: as he says he's killed Germans in Africa and throughout Europe for three years, and he's been weathered by the war. It sets up a natural conflict to have this newbie in their ranks who has to come up to snuff with where the real MEN are at (in caps).There's a lot of big talk, and even bigger war set pieces, especially when it comes time for tank vs tank (and while the Fury isn't the only one, there are a few others, it comes down to one tank vs the other and it is probably the most thrilling part of the film as far as the action goes). But the characters just didn't seem that deep at all, though the actors certainly try to imbue them with more. Pitt of course just has full-on Star quality, as he also did in his other (much greater) war flick Inglourious Basterds. LaBeouf is half very good and half... well, when he gets upset in a scene or emotional, tears flow and it feels just uncomfortable to watch. Bernthal is one dimensional. Pena is okay, and Lerman does what he can as the sort of ""audience"" surrogate.Fury does have a tremendous set-piece though, which feels almost like a short film amid the other set-pieces of the whole (its not like there's one mission for the Fury tank, it's a bunch leading up to the climax which Ill get to in a moment). But it doesn't involve a lot of violence on the physical scale really; the men take over a German town that's been a stronghold for a long time, and Pitt and Lerman see a couple of women looking at them from an apartment. They go up, and at first we're not sure what will happen. But Pitt... just needs a shave, and some food, maybe, and he can speak German which helps, and encourages Lerman to spend 'time' with the younger, more attractive (really, really beautiful) younger woman (I believe he says ""If you don't take her, I will""), and yet it's not savage, it's more delicate and about trying to find that human connection that, as the film drills into the audience, has been lost by April of 45.But this isn't all - the other men in the Fury tank come up to the apartment as well, and it becomes much more tense and awkward, especially with Bernthal's meat-head personage. The scene takes on so many qualities and feels like Ayer at his true strengths here: showing power dynamics, especially between men, how women figure in to it, and what trauma does if you stop and think about it. It's not like the film stops to have this whole scene in this apartment unfold, on the contrary it seems like it's from a better, more engaging film.Sadly, this doesn't last though, and the climax is disappointing mostly as the characters do what they do just because it seems like the time to do it in the story, and it gives one of the main characters a big 'out' that doesn't feel earned or properly explains. It just seems to happen because, you know, Screen writing-Hero reasons. Fury ultimately is a grueling, depressing and super-violent and grim film that may do what it's supposed to do for an audience, but it's also come after movies like it before and doesn't explore (with some exceptions) what can be more remarkable about a war film in the little moments.","

Although at times very unlikely and despite it was not particularly moving, still very entertaining. I liked it for its beautiful scenes and action and it kept me glued to the chair all the time.It is not a masterpiece but if you watch it by not expecting realism more then fun and bloody action then, it is an enjoyable war segment, with good actors and graphically unexceptionable.8+/10","

"JohnDeSando","17 October 2014","""Ideals are peaceful. History is violent."" Wardaddy (Brad Pitt)And violent Fury is, and old-fashioned WWII war story about the commander Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier of a Sherman tank, his crew, and a retinue of tanks, all heroically facing superior German tanks with their ability to destroy Shermans at will. The story is captivating, the soldiers believable, and the heroics inevitably sad. Pitt's similar role, however, in Inglorious Basterds as a Nazi hunter, was far more nuanced, and frankly, directed by the genius Quentin Tarantino. David Ayer's work in other men facing murderous times is still not competition for the sardonic Tarantino.Many war stories tropes are here, such as the young recruit who needs seasoning (Norman, played by Logan Lerman) and the scruffy crew of diverse characters: the outwardly gruff master sergeant (Pitt); the inebriated Mexican, Trina (Michael Pena); the bible- bookworm-killer Gordon (Shia LeBeouf); and the hardened tough guy Grady (Jon Bernthal)--stereotypes all but not overly so. This film is superior to George Clooney's The Monuments Men as the jokes are quiet, not taking away from the grim reality, and the incidents are coherent with the overall plot, not set pieces existing for effect rather than complement. That Pitt and Clooney are best buddies and recently married to accomplished women makes for a kinder comparison. Pitt, with his boffo performances in Benjamin Button and Moneyball and this one, is jumping ahead of his friend in the acting category but still needs to direct to compete overall. As the four tanks dwindle down to just Fury (the name painted on Wardaddy's tank), the intense warfare is mitigate only by a brief encounter between Wardaddy and Norman and two German women hiding in their apartment. What happens is not exactly what you'd expect and more illuminating about the tank's crew than you'd expect. Ayer expertly underplays this episode as he shows a deft hand at even quiet, non warlike moments.Norman will grow too fast for belief with each episode (it is only one day, after all) and Wardaddy's terse advice on matters relating to sentiment, survival, and slaughter: ""It will end, soon. But before it does, a lot more people have to die."" Exceptional heroics surface while everyone knows the German will surrender soon but remain steadfast with respect to their orders to stop the enemy. Although the final scene is hard to believe (at least 300 SS troops versus the tank crew?), the film is not compromised, for we are surely aware that this is not a good war, and war is hell.","

"MattBrady099","31 October 2014","If war every had a face it will be ugly.The story is about a battled-hardened sergeant, Wardaddy, commands a Sherman tank and five-man crew, aiming for the heart of Germany despite being out-manned, out-gunned and fielding a rookie recruit.Fury is a movie that shows what it needs to show, not like other war movies and that is it shows the brutal and hard things in war and how it effect's people, because Fury in opinion is the war film that get's it right just like Saving private Ryan and I'm not even joking.The good things in the movie: The sound in this movie when the bombs are going off or they are having a shoot out scene, it sounds so real and so in your hears loud I got to give the guy who did the sound in this movie a thumps up for that. Brad Pitt in this movie played the broken but still caring Wardaddy, you can see all the pain and stress in his eyes as he has been through wars that will scar a person for life. Logan Lerman did a good job ass well. He was great in this movie better than those Percy Jackson films. But they is this one actor in this movie that I've got to say that this is best performance yet, and that is Shia LaBeouf, yes he may went crazy last year and early this year, but in this movie he did a fantastic job.The bad things in this movie: The character's in this at times can be likable, but at times they not. Towards the end of the movie I started not to care about them because in other scenes their where acting like bullies and ass-holes, and I know they been through a lot of hard times with war and losing people and stuff, but this is a war drama and when these character's are in danger in the battlefield I want them to die, that's a bad sign When a viewer like me want the main character's to die.But overall Fury is the most realist, brutal and hard hitting war drama that I've since Saving Private Ryan.","

"engima571","16 October 2014","Fury was awesome. The camera work was wonderful, the sound was great, and it served very well as an unflinching look at the last weeks of WWII in Europe through the eyes of an armored crew.The primary flaw with the movie is its lack of originality in characters. You have your typical veterans (The leader, the vulgar one, the religious one, and the drunk) and a new fish-out-of-water thrown in with them, but they are all developed adequately in this case. Likewise, the plot is not so simplistic and clichéd as the trailer would imply, but it's still somewhat predictable. If you can get past the slightly formulaic plot and characters, it's generally very well acted and has some great talent driving it.As a WWII reenactor, I sincerely appreciated the effort that went into historical accuracy in the movie. While some of the stars had questionably accurate additions, the movie as a whole went very well. The units portrayed in the film (B Company, 41st Armored Infantry and the 66th Armored Regiment) were real units in the 2nd Armored division in 1945 and served with distinction, giving the characters some great background potential, and the tactics shown weren't too heinous either.You may need a drink afterward, but it's a very, very well done film and I'd highly recommend giving it a chance.","

"Horst_In_Translation","27 January 2016","""Fury"" is an American World War II-themed film from two years ago written and directed by David Ayer, the man who directed Denzel Washington to his second Oscar and is also in charge of the much-awaited 2016 film ""Suicide Squad"". For ""Fury"", he got to work with Brad Pitt, one of the biggest film stars on the planet, plus a fairly famous supporting cast. The outcome is disappointing. I quite like Pitt in some of his roles, but his participation in ""12 Years a Slave"" was already a major letdown and this film here is nothing different. He does not even come close to losing himself in his character. I always had the impression that I was watching Pitt. Zero character transformation from him. But it also has a lot to do with how the film was written, which was in a way that we never forget who the big star here is. The shirt undressing scene is about as cringeworthy as Lautner in ""Twilight"". In terms of the contents of the film, it was an underwhelming watch too. I may be slightly biased as I have never been too big on war films (without any comedy), but ""Fury"" offered absolutely nothing that hasn't been done in other war movies already and most of the time done better. It's tough to feel for any of the characters and the lack of convincing story cannot be made up by boastful special effects, explosions and tanks. So yeah, as a whole this was a disappointing watch, in terms of story and acting, especially the former. People who like empty war films that are style over substance may have a good time with ""Fury"", but everybody else can really skip it. It also felt overlong at no less than 2 hours and 15 minutes, during which it frequently dragged I must say. Thumbs down, certainly nowhere near Pitt's finest career achievements. Actually a contender for weakest, especially with him producing as well. And not a glorious hour for Labeouf, Lerman or Eastwood jr either. Stay away.Okay, the above was my brief review from early 2016 and I got to watch this again now in 2022 and I want to elaborate a bit more on some aspects and also maybe correct myself here and there. First, it can be said that the title is linked to the tank that the protagonists are in charge of. Mostly Brad Pitt's character. The connection with the famous horse is undeniable. The cast names I pretty much gave you already. Michael Peña can be added because he has a lot of screen time and he is the kind of actor you always recognize, but not too often remember the name. Jon Bernthal (mistook him for Tom Hardy) also has great recognition value, but more people will remember his name than Peña's I guess. And Eastwood's son really does not have a lot of screen time at all. Bernthal plays a character where you could think on one occasion he will maybe turn into an antagonist, but eventually the guys' common past helps that they all bond and the conflict at the German women's house also does not carry any additional gravity in the end and they overcome their egos. He also apologizes after all. This scene I just talked about showed us conflict within the group. I guess this is maybe what happens when soldiers are without women for too long. We do not really find out anything about their private lives. The fact that they have sex with German women implies that they do not have a girl waiting for them at home, but this is of course only an assumption. Pitt's character on one occasion says that the tank is his home, so probably no family for him either. This scene with the women also includes the slightly cringeworthy topless scene I talked about back then and I still think it was kinda hilarious in a gimmicky way when one of them loses his clothes and the other starts playing piano. Almost dreamlike, but very surreal and probably not among the film's best moments. Scenes that are memorable for other, for better reasons are the escalation I talked about earlier that followed this undressing I mentioned, the scene in which the new guy is pushed to shoot a German soldier, also before that the scene when he is not ready to shoot a young German and it costs them.One scene that many will like from a technical perspective is a fight between two tanks that surely made you think of two not very mobile, but very strong animals going up against each other. I guess mostly males liked this scene. I didn't really, but this maybe also had to do with the reference to the ""best job they ever had"" and how they all say so was a bit cringeworthy. I still think other than that the way Pitt's character was written was a bit exaggerated here and there how everybody really not only respected, but admired him and also his ""cool comments"" on quite a few occasions did not help, even if admittedly he still got away with those better than probably any other actor on the planet. Like the scene with the guy who responds to a strategic military question from Pitt's character that for all he cares the latter can enter the scene on a flying carpet because he knew what a high-quality soldier Pitt is. Or all the talk about how they are the only survivors and how he never lost one of his team and how he is still human saying he will take the girl if the young guy doesn't or how in the end he is ready to let his men leave before the spectacular final fight, so they keep their lives. Of course, he also saves the young man's life in the end pretty much by saying that he can hide under the tank. Interestingly enough, the young man there is spotted by a German soldier eventually, but the soldier decided to stay quiet. Maybe he was the young man's equivalent on the enemy side. A good German. That one was surely the exception. The film is very anti-German or anti-Nazi you could say. There are scenes that are maybe a bit questionable like when on two occasions for example captured German soldiers are shot in cold blood. The one in which the young guy is supposed to become a man or another when they have a large group of very young Germans capitulate. Their adult leader is killed for what he did. We also see people who got killed by hanging because they refused to fight in the war. Or even the significant others of those refusing to fight got murdered as well. Dark times. Germans are also called Krauts on many occasions. Is this racist? Maybe, but it is also accurate given the way American soldiers were talking back then. So all is good and I can even call the film a Kraut pleaser. Sorry, I just had to.What else is there to say? Oh yeah, you can wonder throughout the movie who from the bunch will live and who will die. I think the only option really was that they will all live somehow or that they almost all die. I kinda had a feeling the young man survives and with Pitt's character I was unsure. But he departs in a heroic way, takes out the one who opens the tank up there before finally dying. He also could only be gunned down from somebody in hiding, which is telling. Maybe it is really not particularly realistic that the rookie is the only one who survives. Or that the girl he just slept with is killed minutes later under the ruins. Then again, it is wartime, the year 1945 in Germany and nothing was really normal or realistic at that point in that country. What else can be added? The film scored some awards recognition for its performances and you could see here and there that LaBeouf would have a brilliant career ahead of him. Interestingly enough, the film was selected by the National Board of Review among the top 10 of its year. Quite an honor and maybe not really expected. It's the kind of movie you'd expect to get in at the Oscars maybe in the sound categories, but it came short despite previous recognition. Paul N. J. Ottosson did not manage to repeat his glorious success from half a decade earlier (The Hurt Locker), but ""Fury"" is one of his biggest career achievements nonetheless and probably will stay so as well. I am not sure if the title is a good choice, but I guess as you see the tank from beginning to end pretty much during this really long film, it makes sense. In any case, it is a much better title than the one they went with for the German release, namely Heart of Steel. So really extremely random and virtually no connection to the film itself. Could be used for any other military-themed film pretty much.War films are a bit of a genre that have always had a hard time with me or I should say that I have always had a hard time appreciating, but as I am growing older, I feel that it is getting a bit easier now and I enjoyed this film from a popcorn perspective indeed. Story-wise, it was alright too, but nothing special and it must be said that in some moments they really screwed up and the way Pitt's character is depicted and glorified here was frequently crossing the line, so I will not totally move away from what I wrote in my original review I must say. I do move away from the negative recommendation though and give it a positive recommendation now. It's a film worth seeing if you like (any of) the actors or if you are generally interested in war films. I would not say that being German (as I am) makes this film a better watch because of how it is entirely set in Germany. It could have been anywhere else too I suppose. And you should probably also watch other war films before this one or maybe skip it altogether if you do not like Pitt in general because, let's be honest here, the film is really full of him and his character from beginning to end and it may feel pretty false to people that do not like him the way I do and I would not even blame them. Technically, it is a really strong achievement of course. I think early on they still struggled a bit with the German characters because I as a German could hear that some of them spoke German with accents and the actors were obviously not German, but towards the end they got that right. With the two women for example or with the bad guys in the end too. So yeah, go see this one, preferrably on the big screen if you get the chance.","

"asfhgwt-1","25 October 2021","I was hopeful this would be a realistic WW2 movie but, unfortunately, it wasn't. A few examples:1. Pitt's tanks didn't use any tactics; they always just moved forward slowly while spaced close together.2. The German Tiger tank would never have moved forward while being charged by Pitt's Sherman. It would have just kept firing without moving -- and Pitt would have been toast. Tanks firing at each other from 10 yards away is laughable.3. Shooting and killing a prisoner -- in front of witnesses, no less -- is a war crime.4. The ending where Pitt kills wave after wave of enemy soldiers with his turret-mounted machine gun was ridiculous.5. The scene with the two women and our creepy hero's ""If you don't (screw her) I will"" statement.6. The usual Hollywood phoniness throughout the film.At least they tried; hence, 2 mercy stars....","

"mkbrrn","9 January 2016","I can't believe that people are reviewing this movie unfavorably. I have never reviewed anything on IMDb but I absolutely must make a stand here. This movie shattered me and made me reflect on my own mortality, the horrors of war and life itself. This movie takes what people are calling ""cliches"" and makes it as if it is the very first time that those aspects of the film have ever touched the screen. I never once noticed anything that was cliché at all, really. Only after I read the reviews on here did I find that people were not up to the task this movie demands. It runs deep and the acting is brilliant. These actors prepared for months and lived in a tank to achieve this level of acting for the film. The clash of personalities and the blend of tension among the crew at times is perfectly rendered. This gives us both the indulgent character of man as well as the regretful side that never leaves after one has taken something that is not theirs.The humanity of the characters is utterly obliterated but every so often, you will see it peak out a tiny bit from under the heavy burden of war that they carry. The contrast with the new face among the crew brings this out perfectly as this character attracts all of the humanity this film has but seems to fumble and drop it giving us more complexity and more to reflect on. These are complex characters given full room to breathe in this film.On the last scene- The last scene in this movie is absolutely brilliant. Is it realistic that this could actually happen in the war? Probably not, but the movie and scene gripped me in the inferno of combat that I never cared. The last scene is meant to illustrate the futility of war and the complete waste of human life it costs us. It is a metaphor. The enormous tenacity of Pitt's character and his futile clinging to his few ideals are what drive this scene. The brutality of his character is fully owned by Pitt. There is no more Pitt left in him. There is only the objective, the end that is inevitable but so far out of reach. I just can't believe that people are reviewing this movie unfavorably. IT is a fantastic movie that gives us what art about WW2 should do: remind us about the past and never let us forget the lessons learned.","

"deacon_blues-3","23 July 2015","I have read the many vicious negative reviews for this film, and I must say that I am at a loss to understand most of the complaints. Many condemned the film as unrealistic. I find this hard to believe, since I have seen almost every WW2 film ever made, including documentaries that used actual war footage, and I found this film to be perhaps the most exciting and realistic one that has ever been made.Consider: This is the only film to ever use an actual, working tiger tank, as well as actual, working Sherman's. In addition, the cast was trained by navy seals and army rangers in an 8-week boot-camp. The main cast was also trained in how to operate, drive, and fire the main Sherman, dubbed ""Fury."" In many scenes the actors themselves were actually operating a real Sherman tank during the live filming. The cast was also coached by four actual surviving WW2 2nd armored division veterans in their 90s to find out what actually being in combat was like, and to what lengths some of them had to go under extreme wartime conditions. Watch the special features on the blu-ray edition, and you will see how much painstaking care was taken by the production crew to present a realistic image of WW2 combat conditions.I'm assuming that most of the negative reviewers are not actual WW2 2nd armored division veterans, since there are only the 4 who consulted on this film still living; yet they posture themselves as experts. I can only assume that these people are armchair, primarily book-informed ideologues who think too much of their own second-hand expertise. Some reviewers complained about the language and behavior of the characters in the film, as if WW2 soldiers did not use profanity or vulgar innuendo, did not have illicit sex with European women, never shot prisoners, and were all Christian, god-fearing, faithful husbands. From all the evidences that I have ever considered on this war, their assertions simply do not hold water, and seem to deny any semblance of reality. Just because they were the greatest generation does not mean that they were all sainted, tee-totaling, Bible quoting, refined gentlemen. The Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier character was a chain-gang prisoner who was given the option of hard labor in prison or fighting and dying for his country. It is conclusive that many actual soldiers were in fact from such a background, and it is hard to imagine such people not using profanity, and engaging in many unethical activities under the extreme duress experienced during actual wartime.The tank battle scene was perhaps somewhat unrealistic, but when one considers the fact that there were only a hand-full of tigers left by the stage of the war depicted in this film, and that Germany had run out of experienced tank soldiers and would have been manning tanks with teenagers and even perhaps young girls, the idea that a tiger would not be able to destroy all the Sherman's, which was the usual outcome throughout most of the war, is not so far-fetched after all. Besides, the Fury's crew were portrayed as being highly experienced in fighting German tanks back to the battles in Northern Africa, so again, the idea that they would be able to at least narrowly survive such an encounter with a tiger while sustaining substantial damages, is really not so unrealistic as some reviewers assume.I do admit that I was a bit troubled by the fact that the SS battalion was initially presented as marching toward the Fury carrying what were obviously many anti-tank weapons, yet when they actually began fighting the Fury's crew it seemed to take the Germans a long time to resort to actually using these bazookas against the Fury. But I suppose some license had to be allowed for to make for an exciting final conflict, and for that I cannot fault the filmmakers too much. Perhaps the Germans were so surprised and scattered by the ruse used by the Fury's crew that they had no time to coordinate such an attack? Whatever the excuse, the final battle is one of the most poignant and moving battle scenes ever filmed, in my extensive experience of watching many other WW2 films.Some reviewers found the ending, where Norman survives even though he is discovered by an SS soldier who then inexplicably never reports finding him, preposterous. But I personally do not. I imagine that there were many reluctant recruits in the German army and even in the SS during this very late stage of the war; and, realizing that such a survivor was worthy of some deference for the courage of mounting such a suicidal defense of that strategic crossroads, decided mercifully not to reveal his whereabouts.All-in-all, I find the observations of the negative reviewers less than compelling, while the film itself I find enormously compelling from start to finish.Fury will forever hold a lasting, memorable place in my experiences of WW2 films; and I highly recommend it!So there!","

"rogerdarlington","26 October 2014","Brad Pitt and the Second World War. What's not to like? Even if, now 50, Pitt really is too old to play a front-line soldier. And the movie is rightly proving a huge commercial success. But haven't we seen all this sort of stuff before, most obviously in ""Inglourious Basterds""? Well, yes and no - ""Fury"" does have some distinctive features.First, it is not often that war films focus on the tank as weapon. The best example was ""Lebanon"" and, although a good deal of ""Fury"" is located within the soldiers' vehicle, the Israeli film was shot entirely within the confines of a tank. A major difference between the two films though is that, in the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, they faced no heavy weaponry whereas, in ""Fury"", we see the the US Army's standard armoured weapon, the M4 Sherman medium tank, facing the much better-armoured German Tiger tank and a sequence when four Shermans lock horns with one Tiger is one of the most viscerally thrilling of the movie.But there are other differences too. The Second World War is usually presented as the nearest we've had to a 'good' war: we know who is the evil invader and who is the noble liberator, who commits war crimes and who acts with unfailing decency. Except that ""Fury"" does not flinch from showing Americans behaving badly, even murderously. A final difference - which adds a certain poignancy to the film - is that it is set in Germany in the final days of the war when the Germans have no reason to keep fighting and the GIs just want to stop killing and go home.All these elements of ""Fury"" are the result of the writer and director being David Ayer for whom this is a very personal movie. Both of his grandfathers fought in the Second World War, he himself is a US Navy veteran who served on a nuclear submarine, and he has made a career out of telling stories about men losing their innocence (think ""Training Day and ""End Of Watch""). In the case of ""Fury"", the innocent character is Norman (Logan Lerman), a clerk suddenly forced to be a gunner, who comes under the unconventional guidance of tank commander Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Pitt). The other three crew members are a mixed bunch of veterans played by Shia LaBeouf (""Bible'), Michael Peña (""Gordo""), and Jon Bernthal (""Coon-Ass"").At so many levels, this is an outstanding work. The direction, the cinematography and the sound are superb, while the vast crew who made the Herfordshire and Oxfordshire countryside of rural England look like the war-blasted Germany have done a terrific job. Ultimately, though, this is two films presented as a single adventure. For the first two- thirds of the movie, we have a traditional 'war is hell' approach. Then, when the tank called ""Fury"" loses its track, we lurch into another kind of film altogether, one in which 'fury' becomes an adjective rather than a noun, one that recalls the final body-fest in the conclusion to ""The Wild Bunch"", one in which war may be hell, but damn it, it's also incredibly exciting and oh so heroic.","

"phd_travel","23 October 2014","Put aside preconceptions about this movie and you will be surprised. Firstly it's not that violent by today's standards. No way it's in the 'Saving Private Ryan' category. What was cringe inducing was the romantic interlude in the German town with the two German women that was drawn out and clichéd. The ending went a bit over the top in a fantasy hero ""Lone Survivor' way but it isn't 'Inglorious' crazy just a bit unrealistically brave. The atrocities shown weren't that gory. Just Brad Pitt's character shooting a POW and some Nazis stringing up Germans who won't fight. Don't expect a realistic historically based true story type war movie and you won't be disappointed.The good points are: gripping tank photography both during the battles and inside the claustrophobic tank. The cast is mostly likable with Michael Pena and a mature looking Shia. Logan Lerman is well cast as the fresh faced idealistic typist plunged into the horrors of the war. In fact the movie is mainly from his POV and he is a sympathetic character. Brad looks older and I couldn't understand too much of his dialog. In fact a big weakness is the dialog which was too thickly accented and almost unintelligible except for the expletives.Overall this was entertaining (if not realistic) and not excessively violent well photographed war movie with a likable cast.","

"davidmvining","22 November 2019","Tough, wounded men arguing with each other in a metal beast upon a scarred patch of earth. Their tank needs some electrical work before it will move again, and everyone's growing impatient with the increasing sense of danger around them. As we learn later, all four of these men have been fighting in that tank, named Fury, since the Allies first landed in Africa, but now it's 1945. The German war machine is broken but not gone, and Nazis are still trying to protect their homeland as America rolls across the German countryside towards Berlin.I loved how this movie looked. Dirty, grungy, and smoke-filled, it looks like a dirtier Ridley Scott movie. There's one scene where one of the characters gets clean, and the event occurs in the middle of the tense central section where cleanliness ends up feeling wrong somehow. Everyone is always covered in dirt and blood. You can almost smell the weeks of sweat and mud and grease clinging to them.The story is rather simple. The tank, having just lost its assistant driver, picks up a new guy to fill the post. He's been in the army for eight weeks while they've been in the war since Africa. They must go from town to town, engaging what little, but dangerous, German forces are left and ultimately defend a crossroads for the furtherance of the army as a whole. That simple story, though, is supported by a simple element. Its structure is centered around the new assistant driver, our eyes into this world. We are there as he goes from refusing to fire guns on possibly dead German bodies to mowing down lines of SS marching towards the tank. The execution on the journey (some might call it a character arc) is so well executed, and I knew it within the movie's first 20 minutes.At the center of that journey (the exact center of the movie, actually) is the scene where Brad Pitt's character cleans up. The tank has advanced into a German town, wiping out the handful of German soldiers and our main character has joined Pitt by invading a small apartment that houses a middle aged woman and her teenaged cousin. The entire point of the movie is to watch humanity strip away as people wade through war, and seeing these two women cower in fear at these two American soldiers creates a sense of unease and unpredictability. But the scene flows from one emotion to another. Tension gives to innocent love and breaks down into sheer terror. It's a fantastic little journey, as claustrophobic as life in the tank.Outside of that, though, are a handful of action scenes that are completely convincing in their brutality. The standout, of course, is the final battle at the crossroads. Heavily inspired by Audie Murphy's heroic action that bears some similarity to the action on screen, the battle is an extended descent into Hell as battle surrounds a broken down tank housing our heroes.Oh, David Ayer...what happened to you? Immediately after this you gave us Suicide Squad. What happened to the efficient and focused storyteller? I would blame Warner Brothers, but then Ayers gave us Bright.","

"joncha","23 August 2020","""To Hell and Back"" meets ""Saving Private Ryan."" The movie accomplished the goal of showing that war is hell and cannot be refined, to paraphrase General Sherman. Even the American ""good guys"" can be as bloodthirsty and barbaric as the Nazis or the Russians. The final ""Battle of the Alamo"" is certainly heroic, but seems far from realistic, mainly because it is hard to believe the SS troops would just throw themselves at one tank en masse without pulling back and planning some better strategy. But who knows? If this was based on any true incident it's one I've never heard of. It certainly shows how short a tanker's life expectancy must have been when confronting the superior German tanks. Also, there probably were cases of clerk/typists being thrown into action. I suspect, however, that they were usually given a rifle and sent to the front lines rather than being tossed into a job requiring some previous mechanical training, such as tank gunner or bomber tail gunner.","

"CinePendejo","5 March 2016","I am not exaggerating with the title there. Considering the shallow 300 RISE OF AN EMPIRE, the even more shallow American SNIPER, to the serviceable UNBROKEN, it seems like 2014 has conjured quite an abundance of underwhelming war movies. That is not to be expected, since at the time we have been engaged in an actual war, and the prospect of delving into war movies that might draw comparisons to real situations seemed much of a stretch, even compared to war movies back in the 20th century. However, there is one war movie that stuck out from the crowd, not so much by story and character, but by grit, depth, and the ability to go full-force with what results from such war that parallels the current one so well. That movie is FURY, directed by David Ayer. Despite a few missteps, this movie easily accomplishes what most war movies sorely lack in this time. POSITIVE: Say what you will about David Ayer, he is one clever man. Most of what I desire from his movies is added depth and tangibility for otherwise sick and depraved people. With TRAINING DAY taking a good-cop/bad-cop story and creating smart, insightful deconstruction of right-abusing cops and ""by-the-books"" moral ism that somehow makes us root for the characters, even when on the edge of degradation. Thankfully,FURY is no different. These characters, however done to death, are greatly humanized thanks to the script and the conditions they must adhere to. Brad Pitt's stern but sympathetic leader character with too much to lose, Shia LaBeouf's Bible-carrying saint faced with a major reality check, and Jon Bernthal's despicable degenerate character, who is still somehow the most sympathetic at all; these characters are done to death, but are excused thanks to a sharp writing and the conditions of what they go through. War is hell, and the gruesome depictions of it makes these characters makes more sense than the simple man caught in the wrong setting. Speaking of war, another Ayer perk is how much he holds NO punches. We see blood, heads blasting, people being set on fire, numerous firefights, among other things that would've fit in a dumb action movie. But, as stated before, it is not dumb, and they way they depict these scenes is out of grit and not lunacy, thus adding to the realism and dread of the setting. This is also buoyed by Ayers still- impressive directing talent, with great composition and editing skills. All while adding what is considered easily the film's highlight, the tense-building and seldom depicted tank battles.NEGATIVE: Sadly, Ayer isn't all too perfect. As much as I loved END OF WATCH, TRAINING DAY, etc., I just could not ignore the way he ends his movies. There is just a nagging feeling that he should patch up the overlong and, at times, ridiculous climaxes. FURY, as it turns out, is one of them. During the groups one last push against the enemy (which, to be fair, is amazing) the characters get axed off one by one in a way so heavy-handed and extensive it kind of jerks me out of the movie. VERDICT: In the end, no matter how cliché and predictable this movie turned out to be, all it matters is how much it works. And FURY definitely works! Trust me folks, give it a chance!RATING: 8/10","

"deloudelouvain","22 March 2015","Well I read some good and bad reviews here and both probably have a point. Okay some scenes might not be realistic enough to make them believable but if I want to see an accurate thing about the war then I just watch a documentary and not an action war movie. Saying that this is a bad movie is ridiculous because all the actors are doing a great job and the way of filming is excellent. The point of the movie is to let you see how ridiculous a war is and how many soldiers die for a cause that is not theirs. Like in any war the real army commanders are not risking their lives and are in fact big cowards. The foot soldiers are the only one that you can call heroes even though killing other people doesn't make you an hero in my eyes. Only saving people can make you an hero. Anyways, I enjoyed the movie and if you like action war movies then you can't go wrong with this one.","

"fathersonholygore","1 December 2014","David Ayer's new thriller Fury is by far one of the most brutal and honest films set during the Second World War ever made. Not only does it present the agony of war, it also works as a great character piece. Brad Pitt leads the cast as Don 'Wardaddy' Collier, a sergeant who rides aboard the titular tank, Fury. Alongside him are his three most trusted men. However, after one of those men dies the crew is saddled with a fresh young army recruit (Lerman) hauled from desk duty to fight in the second Battalion. The five men continue through Germany together, killing every Nazi they find, and try to hold onto their humanity in the face of war and death.The film looks beautiful and everything feels very real (this also marks the first time an actual Tiger tank has been used on a movie set). Ayer shot with film instead of digitally, which gives Fury a very bleak, grim feeling as the tanks and the troops behind them trek through miles of mud. The way it's filmed gives an almost nostalgic feel reminiscent of other great war pictures. No doubt there will be more than a few comparisons to the blockbuster Steven Spielberg film, Saving Private Ryan. Regardless of its predecessors, however, this film holds its own as one of the best World War II films out there.Fury is not delegated solely to bombs, bullets, and the horrific images of war. Ayer wonderfully crafts the film from its opening with a blurry shot of a figure on horseback. It moves slowly through an area where a fight has recently occurred. Bodies lay everywhere. Ashes and fire are all around. The figure, a German, comes into view riding a pale white horse: one of the Four Horsemen, symbolizing death. Wardaddy ambushes the man, killing him, and sends the horse on its way. For a moment he has driven death out. Later, we see the white horse again galloping away once more. When the film nears a close you begin to understand Ayer's use of symbolism.Fury is mainly about what war does to those who engage in and are surrounded by it. It is a film about men trying to hold onto their humanity under the most gruelling conditions. One of the central struggles of the characters is their justification of death as preventing worse deaths for others. How does a man keep on being human even after holding a gun to another man's head and pulling the trigger? And what if a man is forced to do that is worse? Ayer explores these dilemmas throughout the film with help of some stellar acting on all parts.Pitt earns his keep as a continually interesting actor. His portrayal of Wardaddy is fairly subtle and restrained. He looks and acts the part of a haunted war veteran. In solitary moments where the camera sticks on him Pitt conveys a side of war not often seen, as he fights with the emotion inside him trying to escape. The supporting cast is just as top notch. Shia LaBeouf proves capable of playing a quiet character instead of the usual loud cockiness he displays. Joe Bernthal, best known from AMC's The Walking Dead and Michael Peňa who starred in Ayer's earlier film End of Watch, are both in fine form playing men who have seen and done too much to simply return to normal after the war is over. However, it is Logan Lerman that really shines. Playing the rookie soldier on the tank crew alongside Pitt, he displays great acting talent, and conveys the terror of many young men drafted and thrust into battle during World War II without ever having so much as fired a gun. Overall the main cast works together to depict the weary strain of war on those who've fought.I cannot recommend Fury enough. The cinematography is something to behold and really captures the grit of World War II's muddy trenches. There are fairly divided opinions on both Shia LaBeouf and Brad Pitt, and depending on which side you fall it could skew how the movie plays, but I believe they each put in a fantastic performance here. This is a tightly scripted film driven by the emotional force of the actors.There are countless war movies out there. What sets one apart from the pack is its honesty. Ayer pulls no punches about the realities of war from the script to the action sequences. Many war veterans often say that the real heroes never came home, and Fury is a cinematic testament to this statement.","

"bankofmarquis","26 November 2014","FURY is a very fine WWII tank movie. I would even go so far as to say FURY does for WWII tank movies what DAS BOOT did for WWII submarine movies. It is a frank and honest portrayal of how road- weary and worn out Allied troops were by the end of World War II, it is not a glorified ""patriotic"" movie, but rather a grim, dark and dank film about survival punctuated with some intense tank battles.So, why didn't I like it more?The answer is simple - I just didn't care enough about the 5 people we spent over 2 hours in a tank with. Start with Brad Pitt's Sgt. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier. Clearly, good at what he does and clever enough to keep his ""band of brothers"" alive, Pitt's portrayal is gritty, dim and dark (in keeping with mood of this movie). It is a more realistic, restrained character/performance than his Lt. Aldo Raine in INGLORIOUS BASTARD. The trouble is - I rooted much more for Raine than I ever did for Collier.Add on top of that, Jon Bernthal - channeling an R-Rated version of his character Shane from the Walking Dead, Michael Pena being ""gritty"" as Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia and fresh faced Logan Lerman as fresh faced Norman Ellison - all right out of central casting - and we have a group that was really hard for me to root for, or worry over.Only Shia LeBeouf's Boyd ""Bible"" Swan was a character that I cared about. I caught myself midway through this movie thinking ""Gosh, LeBeouf really can act."" I then realized I had to take the surprise out of my voice. Let's hope he builds on this and quits his real life ""crazy"" act and all those Transformers movies.As for the rest of the movie, director David Ayer keeps the action moving and stages some wonderfully intense tank battles that makes this movie worth watching.Just don't get too attached to the characters.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)","

"phatrick88","2 November 2014","I walked out of the theater speechless, that it is 2014 and we can still produce movies that are so historically inaccurate. Heck I dug up my old IMDb account just to neg this movie.Like my title says, this movie is an absolute slap in the face to the millions of World War II vets who fought to secure our freedom. The conduct and parlance of these soldiers was extremely out of character with the 1940's. Please, don't curse like it's 2014 when you're portraying an event that happened 70 years ago. They couldn't even display proper military discipline. I knew it was going to be bad just from a the first few minutes of dialogue and acting, then the combat scenes began!So totally unrealistic you can't even suspend your disbelief and enjoy it. Were the Germans firing blanks? Hundreds of dead Germans with only a few GI casualties. The Waffen SS - the most revered fighting force of the time - running aimlessly into machine gun fire like a cheap video game. Missing their mark at point blank range. Germans typically portrayed as weak, inferior and dumb. I think you could live in a test tube and probably be smart enough to realize the final battle was a JOKE. So silly nothing more needs to be said. The reality is, all four tanks would have been likely knocked out in the first battle by the Germans in the tree-line with their AA and panzerschrecks. The Tiger tank in the second battle would have knocked out all four Sherman tanks, on the first shot, Fury never would have got behind it to make the kill (research some famous tank battles). The SS in the final battle would have made short work of their disabled tank in a few short minutes. This movie best exemplifies the quote:""History is written by the victors""","

"Wuchakk","14 December 2014","RELEASED IN 2014, ""Fury"" details the exploits of 'Wardaddy' (Brad Pitt) and his Sherman tank crew during the final month of the European theater of World War II. A meek new guy who knows little about tanks, Norman (Logan Lerman), joins the crew and must learn to kill. Making a final push into the heart of Nazi Germany, the Fury crew makes a heroic stand when their tank breaks down. Writer/director Dick Ayers wrote the screenplay for 2001's excellent ""Training Day."" In ""Fury"" he successfully shows the soldiers' view of WWII through the eyes of a Sherman tank crew. I know of no other war film that sets out or accomplishes this; Oddball and his crew from ""Kelly's Heroes"" (1970) perhaps comes closest.I mainly judge films by whether or not the story keeps my attention. After all, what good is great action, thrills and incredible special effects if the story (or the way it's told) is dullsville, like, say, ""The Mummy Returns"" (2001) or ""Man of Steel""(2013)? ""Fury"" kept my attention from beginning to end and the characters are all memorable. Speaking of which, the three remaining crewmembers are 'Bible' (Shia LaBeouf), 'Coonass' (Jon Bernthal) and 'Gordo' (Michael Peña). 'Bible' is fittingly an evangelical who strives not to lose his spirituality while brutally annihilating people in the name of war, whereas newcomer Norman is a mainline Christian (Episcopalian). A handful of scripture passages are quoted during the course of the movie, including a couple near the end by Wardaddy. This is an interesting revelation because Wardaddy has become hardened by the war after three years fighting from North Africa all the way to the nucleus of the Nazis. This implies that he was a devoted believer before the war but only a glimmer of his former spiritual affection remains. There are other quality character bits interspersed throughout the film, like how annoying drunk bastages may not be so bad once they sober up.Beyond the above, the film offers the typical tragic insights about the nature of war. The long final stand in the last act may be unlikely, but it makes for a heroic and thrilling ending to a war movie (yes, it's a MOVIE, not a friggin' documentary). At the end of the day ""Fury"" arguably ranks with the best WWII movies, like ""Where Eagles Dare"" (1968), ""Enemy at the Gates"" (2001), ""The Eagle has Landed"" (1976), ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957), ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967), ""The Thin Red Line"" (1998), and ""Inglourious Basterds"" (2009). As far as comparing it to the overrated ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), the first half hour of that movie is great, but the rest of it leaves much to be desired (remember the lame dog tag sequence?); ""Fury"" is leagues better IMHO. The melancholic and moving score by Steven Price is a highlight. Alicia von Rittberg (Emma), Anamaria Marinca (Irma) and Jason Isaacs are featured in fairly notable roles. Speaking of Emma, the brief romance between her and Norman is decidedly forced, which is one of the few negatives of ""Fury,"" but I get the point of that sequence.THE FILM RUNS 134 minutes and was shot in England.GRADE: A-","

"dworldeater","20 May 2018","Fury is an excellent and action packed WW2 movie by one of my favorite current film makers David Ayer. He is best known for working as a writer and/or director on a lot of excellent police thrillers. Besides the cinematic abomination known as Suicide Squad, I enjoy the movies he works on. This is unlike a lot of more one dimensional jingostic WW2 movies. The film is very gritty and violent and portrays a fairly bleak view of survival of Brad Pitt and his crew fighting the Nazi's and doing their best to survive inside a Sherman tank, which is inferior to the tanks driven by the enemy. This gives a fairly sound depiction of the horrors of war and what these men must endure. The performances are very somber and very good. The actors had great chemistry. The overall tone and mood of the film brings to mind the band Discharge, which would be a good aural companion piece to the film. Fury is a very good film, that is solid and well made.","

"wijajo-72563","15 February 2017","**Contains mild spoilers**The WWII battlefield has been retold countless times. As such, a new approach can be hard to create.The film starts well, unlike most modern WWII films it focuses on an experienced tank crew headed by none other but the charismatic Brad Pitt. Against all odds this tank team seems to have survived multiple battles and the films begins showing a severely religious and naive new recruit commanded to join the tight-knit team near the end of the war. It becomes immediately clear that part of the film will evolve around the changing psyche of this new idealistic, utopian-minded recruit.The film is explicitly gritty, showing the true horror of war. One particular memorable, albeit brief, scene shows a body being run over by a tank. Another shows bulldozers clearing away a small mountain of dead German soldiers. It seems to denounce the reality of war as any good war film will do. Yet, despite this fantastic start the film made, it soon descends in terms of script, characters and story-line. The transition of new recruit ""Norman"" is so fast as to be unbelievable. Meanwhile an against-the-odds action-focused scene at the end, shows the Nazi enemy to be inept rather than the feared experienced enemy they actually were. In the end, the film seems to glorify violence that it earlier seemed to condemn.The film is easy-watching, at times shocking and well produced but in the end is ultimately forgettable. If you are just looking for a general war film to fill the time, this film will fit the bill.","

"questl-18592","27 July 2022","I now officially want more tank movies. The movie itself, the actual story, and the movement of it was pretty generic but the tank aspect was really fascinating and different feeling. More than the tank though, the performances here were all really on point. LaBeouf nearly stole the movie but everyone here is solid and on point. Lerman's character is a little too green at the beginning for my liking but it does further highlight his transformation. The only other downside I really have? I feel like the ending cheaped out a little and I would've loved it to be even bleaker to reflect the horror of war.Really enjoyed this one. It could have so easily been just another generic war movie but it really stood out to me. Definitely recommend checking it out, just be aware of the violence that it doesn't shy away from.","

"ravitchn","15 April 2017","Not a fan of war movies and battlefield scenes I had no expectation that I would enjoy this flick. And enjoy is not the right word because it is very long and certainly difficult to deal with. But there are two reasons I believe the movie is to be praised. First the hardened leader of the tank squad, WarDaddy played by Brad Pitt, reveals deep down a sympathy and a compassion for a young soldier way out of his element, an office soldier who somehow becomes a victim of army procedures and was sent to fight in a dangerous showdown with SS troops desperate to save the Heimat from the Americans in the last days of the war somewhere in western or central Germany. Pitt is tough, hard on his comrades and even harder on the Krauts he encounters. But he also, my second point, is able to be somewhat sympathetic even to the German civilians he encounters, whether they were or were not Nazi believers. The scene in the German home with the two women and the battle scared veteran Americans, plus the coming of age there of Norman the young soldier mentioned above, is very movingly done. Pitt's character is complex: a mixture of needed brutality covering perhaps a sensitivity as genuine as Norman's. You don't see this very often in these movies and I applaud those responsible for seeing past the obvious. I am not sure whether Norman's life is spared by accident or by a German soldier's sudden decision to be merciful; if the latter is meant then even a German soldier can have compassion. This did not occur often -- especially not on the Eastern Front -- but it did occur. Germans are after all not that different from us, as much as we should like to think and as much as we are justified in being skeptical.","

"prahladagarwal","28 January 2015","Fury by David Ayer is a brilliantly made war film which directly takes you to the battlefield without any introductions or developing historical references. It can be summed as watching a WWII archive through the eye of a battle tank. Fury shot in a crude, gory and brutal fashion, is a story about courage, glory and pride of a tank and its people. The theme is very straight-forward with episodic clashes and encounters. Ideals are peaceful, history is violent is one of the many beautiful dialogues which reinforces terror and fear in a war situation. Fury deals with story of a tank which manoeuvres Germany and briefly stops at a house where the tank leader takes a moment of peace. Next the tank runs into a Nazi contingent and decides to defend its location with 5 people and limited ammunition. With Fury, Brad Pitt moves up the food chain after a super performance in Inglorious Bastards. The cinematography of Fury is noteworthy and appreciable, it keeps the set-up relevant to the audience. The incredulous ending has not been distorted but rendered memorable with a neat cinematography/VFX. Highly recommended as this type of work is rare!","

"Wizard-8","12 June 2015","In some aspects, ""Fury"" feels like an old fashioned war movie from several decades ago. The movie does dabble with character clichés that are right out of the golden age of Hollywood (the green recruit, the ethnic soldier, etc.) Though the war films from the golden age usually went into better depth with their characters; the characters here are somewhat thin. In its defense, the movie does make the interesting decision to not make all of its main characters completely likable; they all are shown to have some negative aspects. And while their constant swearing is a little annoying, I think that's how many soldiers in the battlefield talk. The movie is also more explicit than older war movies with its violence. There is some truly graphic violence here, but it's depicted in a way that shows that real warfare is not fun and games - it's serious business. I will admit that some of the tactics used by both sides in warfare in the movie are a little hard to swallow, but the battles are compelling all the same. And while the story suffers from the fact that it's basically a collection of (long) vignettes instead of one solid story, the movie is not boring despite lasting more than two hours. While I wouldn't say the movie is worth paying top dollar to see, it is worth a viewing under less expensive conditions, like when it comes on cable.","

"dplowsav","1 April 2019","Fury is a great tank flick of a film that focuses on tank warfare, sort of focus that is quite rare. Not only that, I'm pleasantly surprised to see them use genuine Sherman and Tiger tanks (working museum models) which shows they put a lot of care in getting across the historical accuracy of how these tanks operated.With that said, can't say the same for the actual script, tactics and methods used here. My favourite scene being the Tiger battle against the Shermans, and sadly, my least favourite would have to be the ending.The ending was your typical cliche hollywood last stand as the 'heroes' of the film face off against the germans in a last ditch suicidal effort because 'reasons'. Reasons that are never really explained other than a sense of hatred for the SS, and it so happens that an SS Platoon is making their way to them.All in all, a disappointing finish with a last stand that made absolutely zero sense because of the german inability to flank and surround an immobilized tank. But hey, if it made sense, then we would probably get a very different film.And maybe just a slightly better visual experience than what we ended up getting.Regardless, Fury is a great watch up until the ending, and should be enjoyed for what it is; TANKS!","

"rmax304823","6 August 2015","I expected more from the movie but more turned out to be less.It's really a ""last stand"" story except that in the Spring of 1945 American tankers weren't making much of a last stand. That's the way the movie presents it. But the real 7th Cavalry was the Wehrmacht, who were just about out of everything except boys and old men, fanatic SS troops, and great big-assed Tiger tanks that our M-4 Shermans couldn't hope to cope with, despite the newer model having been up-gunned and despite there being far more Shermans than Tigers. We also had air superiority and a vast advantage in artillery, so we were plowing our way through a nearly spent Germany. Yet that doesn't stop the movie from turning It's a grim story, all rain, muck, and mud, and a Sherman tank with ""FURY"" painted on the barrel. That barrel was part of a high-velocity 76 mm. cannon, which was an improvement over the earlier variant's 75 mm. But the movie doesn't explain any of that because that's not where it wants to go.And that raises the question of where the movie DOES want to go. My answer is firm. I don't know.It's another CGI extravaganza but not that much of an improvement over the ""Great Tank Battles"" that can be seen on YouTube. Brad Pitt is the tank commander and he's a pretty lousy guy who commits war crimes and tells the newly arrived audience proxy member to go screw a German girl they've discovered in an abandoned house. ""If you don't take her in the bedroom, I will."" Improbably -- IMPOSSIBLY -- she seems to fall in love with him after one roll in the hay, and after these five greasy aliens have occupied her shabby flat and eaten her food.Pitt's main characteristics, aside from his authoritarianism and sadism, is his desire to kill Germans. In the end it leads to the death of all the crew members but one.The supporting crew members are grimy stereotypes: the Bible-thumping gunner, the Latino driver, and the drawling Southern loader. The junior soldier is a greenhorn clerk redirected into tank service as the assistant gunner. He gets a swift, wide-eyed education in warfare while desperately trying to survive and integrate with his unwelcoming, veteran crew mates.One of the crew -- I forget which -- is given an especially repulsive appearance and demeanor. He slobbers freely. He has a distinctive and very ugly haircut. I had a feeling that the director and the make up folks would love to have shaved his head bald and given him a Goth tattoo but even THEY realized that it might give the game away.Well -- a virtue of the movie. You get a better feel for the crowded, painted, steel interior of the tank that I've seen in any other movie.Otherwise, if you need a mindless adrenalin fix, this is probably the answer.","

"Screen_Blitz","28 January 2015","David Ayer's dark and gritty take on World War II boasts a powerful representation on the horrifying reality of war. In short words, it has nothing to say other than ""War is hell"", or as Brad Pitt's character puts it ""Ideals are peaceful, history is violent"". Shining on screen is a stellar cast of actors taking on roles of soldiers in this violent, gory World War II flick that shies away from director David Ayer's typical works which often deal with police drama ('End of Watch', 'Street Kings'). And what David Ayer pedals on screen this time is a crew of soldiers who face the unforgiving reality of war on the European battlefront, which is no stranger to lead Brad Pitt who wielded the role of Nazi-killing Lieutenant Aldo Rain in Quentin Tarantino's 'Inglourious Basterds' five years ago. In further detail, he proceeds not with the goal to give viewers a bleak history lesson, but to simply tell a story that feels parallel to what being in active combat feels like, even if the plot feels slightly run-of-the-mill. Set in April of 1945 near the conclusion of World War II on the European Theater, Brad Pitt plays Wardaddy, a war-hardened staff sergeant leading of his crew of men in an M4 Sherman Tank through the European battlefields to strike at the heart of Nazi Germany. His courageous crew includes a religious soldier named Boyd ""Bible"" Swan (played by Shia Labeouf), flamboyant gun-loader Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis (played by Jon Bernthal), Mexican tank driver Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia (played by Michael Pena), and the newly hired assistant driver Norman Ellis (played by Logan Lerman). Together, these crew of men fight through the violent fields of Germany while struggling to cope with a bloodshed horrors of active combat.Although David Ayer's rendition of World War II on the European front doesn't flourish the same emotionally gravitas as 'Saving Private Ryan' (unsurprisingly), it paints a highly disturbing portrait of the harsh reality of war in a way that rarely pulls the punches. When the crew enters the battlegrounds, heads are blown off, soldiers are engulfed in flames, bodies are torn apart, and our characters bravely pursue through the fields knowing they can be killed in any second. If there are any moments that offer levity, they cam from the occasional humorous one-liners that the characters spit out every now and then. All in all, they do little to sugarcoat the grueling atmosphere that pervades this emotionally blistering trek. The story focuses on a crew of men crammed inside the tight confinement of a Sherman Tank, and newest member on the ride is Logan Lerman's character Norman Ellis, a young typist who's inexperienced in active combat. Upon first entering the battlegrounds, Norman struggles vigorously on coping with the horrors of war as opposed to Brad Pitt's Wardaddy who's seen it all since the beginning. As the story proceeds, Norman grows a broader eye on the truth of war that puts to maximum test in the climatic battle sequence during the final third. And his character's growth from cowardly to bravely is handled mostly well, though it feels a little rushed towards the end in the aforementioned battle sequence. As for the rest of the characters who are left in a two-dimensional state (except Wardaddy), they are not only fortunately energized with cast's solid performances that speak high volumes of the actors' talents, but very human in their portrayal (though Jon Bernthal character's shows slight resemblance of a caricature).Fury is gritty, violent, but highly entertaining World War II flick empowered by a powerful direction by David Ayer and solid performances by a likable cast. While the film may not hold the same amount of emotional gravitas as other high-ranked films of the genre, it is honest in it's portrait of war and stands strong as a powerful picture.","

"harry_tk_yung","25 October 2014","I cannot claim that ""tank movie"" qualifies as a separate genre by itself but those who enjoyed ""Battle of the Bulge"" (1965) half a century ago would love ""Fury"". Both anchored on the post-D-Day period when the Nazis made a desperate final attempt to turn the tides of war by unleashing the last instalment their still superior hardware: Tiger tanks. While ""Bulge"" is a dramatic (actually somewhat melodramatic) heroic epic that essentially entertains, ""Fury"" is an intimate account that entertains, probes, moves and challenges.""Fury"" can boast of the distinction of being shot with the ONLY remaining real, working Tiger tank in the world, ""T-131"", that was captured from the Nazis during the war and still kept intact in a museum. Pitched against Tigers were American Sherman tanks, decidedly outclassed in both fire power and armor protection.With some simplification, I could say that ""Fury"" is a brief (a few days) account of intimate scrutiny of 5 people who man the titular Sherman tank, starting with the arrival of newcomer (replacement of a lost assistant driver) Norman (no reference to ""Psycho"", I think) who was obviously in the wrong place, having joined the army for only 8 weeks, ""fighting"" with nothing deadlier than a typewriter. You can look at this multi-dimensioned movie as a coming-of-age story of Normal, well performed by Logan Lerman.The soul of the movie however is squad leader ""Wardaddy"", superbly portrayed by a Brad Pitt who never stops surprising the audience with his virtuosity, such as the dumb idiot in ""Burn after reading"" (2008) that you would never have associated with him until you see the movie. In ""Fury"" the first impressive I have is that I have never seen Pitt so old, not old as in Benjamin Button, but in the sense of being world-wearied and war-wearied. Shia LaBeouf finally capitalizes on a role that can showcase his acting ability, a soldier nicknamed ""Bible"" which quite aptly defines the character. The delicate bond between Wardaddy and Bible is quite subtle but still palpable. The other two members are nicknamed Gordo (Michael Pena) and Coon-Ass (Jon Bernthal), two varieties of the gruffly, macho soldier from the grass root.The one thing that must be remembered is that except for newcomer Norman (who finally got accepted and earned a nickname ""Machine"") these people have been through hell, over and over again, in the claustrophobic interior of a tank. The bonding this has on them is something that we can only try to appreciate, but never truly empathize with.Those looking for action should be well satisfied with the final two set pieces. First, we witnessed several Sherman tanks destroyed one after another by a Tiger which was ultimately vindicated by Wardaddy and his boys through skill and courage in maneuvering Fury. This level of excellence in filming a tank battle you have never seen before. In the grand finale, their tank, the only one remaining in the group, got stuck after hitting a land mine. All alone in the middle of nowhere, working to repair the tank, the found (through Norman posted on a watch) that marching towards them in a collision course is a troop of some 300 German infantry, too many for 5 men to cope with, even with a stalled tank that can still fight. The war was on the verge of being won and the logical course of action appears to be to hide in the woods until the troop passes. But ""No"", says Wardaddy, ""this is my home"", patting Fury with deep affection. The rest is history (for the movie).There is one interlude that deserves mentioning. I shall not go into details but briefly, during a respite in a German town captured, Wardaddy and Norman find a moment of quiet domesticity in an apartment where two attractive German women where to prepare and share a quiet meal (eggs provided by Wardaddy – don't ask me how he got them) with them. While Normal is drawn to the piano and plays from the music scores there, the younger of the two women (a girl, essentially) is drawn to him and starts singing to the music. This leads to a tender love scene that is left mostly to the audience's imagination. But when the other three members of the crew walk it, real drama and tension starts - a mixture of absurdity and reality.Finally, I must mention the opening scene which could be a tribute to a similar scene in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" – a faint dot appears in the center of the screen and is gradually reveals as a man approaching on horseback. This underlies the mesmerizing photography with which ""Fury"" is shot.","

"spiff-12","19 November 2016","I don't know who they got as their 'Military expert' but it must have been some homeless guy in fatigues who wandered into the studio after a fresh haircut. I like that they portray the gritty realism of war. My grandfather was in the first World War...and the stories that I heard? You don't want to know. This was during the ugliest time of WW2 when Hitler and his coterie of goose stepping goons were throwing women, children and the elderly in the path of trained, seasoned soldiers. The arm of instigators who were responsible for brutally enforcing this order was the Waffen Schutzstaffel (SS; Elite troops). Anger toward the SS meant that, Generally, a surrendering SS could, at most, hope for a quick death. Of course an elite soldier who knows that, for him, there is only victory or death, is going to fight like hell.The movie falls apart in the ridiculous amount of tactical and physical flaws regarding the hardware.-A whole SS division isn't going to be marching down the road toward a battle scene in close formation.-A Panzerfaust uses a shape charge. Though impressive penetration at it's optimal range (given no other factors), the effect on the armor is localized and should not 'Blow Through' the other side.-The Fury obviously has a 76mm High Velocity gun. It could have killed a Tiger at 1000 yards...no problem.-The crew waits until the SS close marches to right on top of them before engaging. They could have engaged them at 200 meters with 2 .30 Cal. MG's a .50 cal MG and a 76mm using HE. They could have gotten 3/4s of them and bugged out using smoke...before they even got close.-American Grenades explode on impact but the German grenades give Brad Pitt enough time for a Soliloquy. -Even a 75mm could pen a Tiger side max armor in 250 meters. You don't have to get right behind it.-The tactics the SS employ make them look like absolute idiots. Did the real SS change clothes with some Civies!?It is like someone who was supposed to do proper research that didn't know anything about the subject matter or even basic tactics. Who thought the knowledge came as easy as watching some Youtube video (and I think I know which one)...without cross referencing the data. There are plenty of people out there who know this stuff intimately. It just reeks of Laziness that the producers didn't find one!","

"vandykeu","30 October 2014","Fury is unflinching in its portrayal of war, and is probably the most honest, least patriotic American anti-war film made about WW2. The only alternative I can think of is Steve McQueen's Hell is for Heroes. Saving Private Ryan, this ain't. It's one of those where you get the feeling that everything on screen probably happened, at least once. The only exception is the final battle, which is a bit Hollywood but at the same time not entirely impossible either, if you read of Audie Murphy's last battle.Technically, it is incredibly well-researched. The details of the tanks, the crews, and armored combat are spot-on. It doesn't glorify anything, and shows both the positive and the negative qualities that Americans likely had in abundance at that stage of the war. The only thing it doesn't have is the smell. The sound effects are incredible.Dramatically, watching it was a soul-shattering experience. It builds tension, both in and outside of combat, in a realistic way that few movies pull off successfully, especially most Hollywood war movies. The battle with the Tiger for me was especially tense, especially to anyone familiar with how Shermans had to fight Tigers in order to win. The actors disappear in their roles- even the big names. I believed every one of them could have been real.I think the comparisons that have been made with Das Boot are very apt. I also saw similarities to Platoon, but it is done better in Fury because there is no clear good guy or bad guy, as Barnes and Elias were in the former. Judging by the reviews it's gotten, it probably won't be recognized as such, but I think this is one of the great anti-war movies of history. It's certainly one of the most realistic.","

"dusan-22","16 January 2015","This film contains two faces. One represents good filmmaking and pretty good war drama depicting, some drama realism of the war that we haven't seen in the US movies for a very long time. In that way, this is one of the best war movies that Hollywood has ever produced, from my point of view. The war atmosphere, social profile of the soldiers in the US army and their dialogs are among the best I have ever seen regarding the American movies. We have all been used to watch the American soldiers in the US movies as the charming knights in the shining armour but in this movie it was far from that and much closer to reality. Acting was very good. I also think that the director has seen the Apocalypse Now and the Iron Cross but also Russian 9-th Rota, and utilized everything he liked from them.However, the other face of this film is an irritating low sense for technical and strategical military reality of WWII:Battle scenes are more suitable for a fairy tale than for a war movie: Germans in an AT ambush are being ambushed by the four Sherman tanks, kind a ridiculous. Tiger tank which was a heavy tank with a much longer shooting range than the medium Sherman tank was never running towards the incoming tank group but rather shooting from a distance (or retreat if necessary) where the enemy tanks couldn't have reached it which was its main advantage. Its like you're holding a gun and you see four guys with knives running after you and instead of shooting at them while retreating, you start running at them, like – now I'm going to smash your had with this gun! Above all, lets mention that Germans put their best men to be the tiger tank crew so it was almost impossible to destroy that tank from the ground. This is why the US Air force was sent after tigers in most of the cases - US dive bombers dropping huge bombs on the tiger turrets were the only real weapon against these tanks, cause even if you ambushed them with medium tanks, you couldn't approach them as they were always escorted with light or medium tanks.Killing 300 SS soldiers with a non-mobile Sherman tank is more for some Disney Cartoon (I won't go into the details where SS soldiers are aiming a tank with a panzer-Faust from the 3 meter distance even though that weapon could shoot from a range from 30 to 150 meters. It's like you approach to 30 feet range to shoot an enemy with a sniper rifle . And one Molotov cocktail ends the tank that can't move in a jiffy.Also, a tank lieutenant that is jumping on a highly decorated SS officer on a horse and killing him without problem is more suitable for some John Wayne movie and has nothing to do with WWII reality. There is an idea that the group is experienced Africa corp unit but you got to now then that they were fighting the more experienced and incomparably more trained, armed and successful German troops here. Also, few scenes where Germans beg for life which is more than ridiculous cause Germans were fanatics and such thing didn't happen with their POW. Don't forget, Germany was fighting USSR and the US at the same time and still was so hard to break their spine.","

"antoniotierno","16 June 2015","One of the best war movies ever, a masterpiece close to the levels of Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, as far as I can see. Fury has the admirable ambition and achievement of showing how even the Greatest Generation could brutalize and be brutalized by war. Brad Pitt, you'll recall, already won World War II in Inglourious Bastards, well over here he's perfect as well, along with the rest of the cast. The story is intense and suspenseful with strong performances and has also an unsentimental approach as to show the dehumanizing side of war in its raw, the unflinching details and what makes us humans, like the bravery and mercy found in people in the worst of circumstances.","

"graupepillard","22 November 2014","Director David Ayer's horrific war drama, FURY - starring Brad Pitt as the lead honcho, a tough father figure of a Sherman Tank crew of 5 men, including a virginal, brilliant blue-eyed ""rookie"" as the gunner (Logan Lerman), a boy/man whose unshaven cheeks are as supple as his belief in the ""goodness"" of his fellow human beings, even in the most grisly of circumstances. His transformation into steeled ""manhood"" is a painful reality to observe. Like the Battle of Thermopylae the odds are stacked against this team of hardened, profane, American warriors fighting the Nazis on German soil in April 1945 - a last ditch violent effort by the Axis to prevail, realizing that defeat was fast approaching. The cinematography with its deep, muddy browns and fiery oranges casts a blazing light which permeates into the conscience and hearts of the characters. War is not exonerated or laundered; it is bloody and dirty - one's moral compass is abandoned in the effort to survive slaughter and death, be it by one's own hands or at the hands of others. It is hard to imagine going through this experience and not returning home shell-shocked and psychically wounded.In the platoon is a soldier who puts his belief in God's will and protection, nicknamed ""Bible"" (Shia La Beouf,) an actor who has never been able to seduce me.until now. In FURY I finally understood La Beouf's appeal, with those dark penetrating eyes and a smile that conveys the Divinity's rapture; he is a symbol of underlying goodness prevailing over his own destructive power and the carnage of the ""enemy.""","

"twanster-97655","14 May 2021","Seriously people, get a grip! This movie is an action war film, it doesn't pretend to be a true story. We all know the SS wouldn't have attacked a tank head on and we all know a busted tank in a road would last less than a minute against 300 SS troops but this is Hollywood, you don't watch braveheart or gladiator or movies like 300 to be educated, you watch for the action and the gore, the fights and the drama and this has it all. There is alot of over used things in the film, every American movie has a thought guy,a new guy, a crazy guy with bad teeth and a religious guy.. They even squeezed in a minor live story ina n attempt to tick every box.. The film could have been better, it needed more tank battles, as usual the good guys die at the end, other than the new guy who you assumed would die at the start that is.. The battle is unrealistic but epic, the film is a hit, a film you'll see more than once, acted brilliantly, casted well, fast moving plot, had there been more tank battles it would have been better but its still a classic!","

"danielgroza","3 November 2022","With ""Fury"", director David Ayer takes the idea of showcasing the horrors of war literally, fully embracing the visual technology of this great art we call cinema by displaying as much gore and body horror as he can without damaging this movie's already high R rating. Still, while he does his best to envelop the entire world in the horror of the Second World War, there's still one thing lacking in flesh, and that is character development.The movie stars Brad Pitt as Don 'Wardaddy' Collier, a tank commander who has both physical and emotional scars and is careful not to attach to anyone too much for obvious reasons. His crew is formed of the religious Bible (Shia LaBeouf), the Latino-spirited driver Gordo (Michael Peña) and the loose Grady (Jon Bernthal). The movie meets the crew at a low point, after losing their gunnery chief but there's no time for mourning. With the US Army knee-deep in Germany, the movie accelerates its pacing by introducing the greenhorn Norman (Logan Lerman) as the crew's new gunner--but he is a typewriter with zero war experience.Ayer passes Norman through the meat grinder, mercilessly transforming him from an every-day office-working moralist into a man stripped of nothing but his survival instincts, becoming like his peers. But while this 180-degree turn serves to show just what kind of brutality is needed to survive a war--and how little room there is for petty morality--it also happens at an unnatural pace, giving no time for the character to consume, comprehend much less adapt to these new ideals. They are heavy concepts, but they are being jetted at Norman through a garden hose.It also doesn't help that Don's entire crew is taken straight out of a Hollywood template. The guys act tough with Norman to strengthen him. He retaliates, preaching rights and wrongs which have long abandoned war, his lack of experience and of understanding leading to more death. He is berated again. He retaliates again. He eventually adapts. The crew continues their abuse, Don straightens them out as well. It works because they respect him. They respect him because of his experience and attitude towards them--or maybe is just his sick low-fade. Anyway, you get the picture.The actors all try their best at their performances and they are pretty well cast, but there is only so much you can coax out when you are working with such defaulted personalities. Brad Pitt in particular leans on his male charm to deliver an authoritarian performance as a guy you really don't want to mess with but can't help but respect--even if his character is not deep enough to tell us why. Meanwhile, Shia LaBeouf looks ridiculous even when he is not acting as such.So, this is a fast-moving movie and its action scenes are nothing short of impressive, particularly one involving a tactical tank battle against a more powerful German Tiger. It does slow down eventually during a scene in a captured German village. There, Don invites Norman as they head inside the apartment of two German women. Don immediately commands the people in the room--including Norman who is ordered to take the other girl in a separate room. But while Don exercises authority, he is never abusive making this the only scene in the movie in which Ayer flushes out his characters. Even so, it lingers for way too long and doesn't culminate in much of a conclusion beyond the already well known realization that guess what? War is hell.But just to be clear: I am not criticizing Ayer's focus on aesthetic horror and visual impressionism. It definitely gets the point across and it's not focused on glamorizing war like ye old Hollywood used to do, but rather to demonize it. A particular scene in which dozens of planes are shown flying in formation sticks with me more than the pounds of flesh ""Fury"" insists upon. It sticks because it's a blunt reminder of how big and inescapable war is, present on both land and air, and it's almost claustrophobic as it seemingly transforms the entire world in a caged battlefield. What I am criticizing though is how Ayer fails to extend his attention to other things that make a movie great: like human ruminations and insight--not to mention a ""final battle"" which is way too overblown.Very guy-centric and macho, ""Fury"" acts tough as a means to survive. And while the visuals are top notch, they can only get you so far.","

"boiannus","6 November 2014","One of the crappiest war movies I've ever seen, if not the worst!Firstly: No story, no real plot. War is almost over, maybe in 2-3 weeks and there are just 5 guys driving around in tank and fighting still resisting Germans. And than suddenly everything depends on them. Namely unit with cooks is left defenseless and if they got beaten whole division would be lost. OMG!!! And we all know what could happen then. The war would be lost! Luckily for mankind there is this Sherman tank equipped with Brad Pitt eager to do whatever it takes to hold the Germans and save the cooks.Well, to this point it wasn't so bad. Battles were OK displayed. It was interesting to see from tank's crew point of view how it looks to fight. But then, we have most ridiculous and naive war scene since ""Rambo 3"".They got stuck on some crossroad in the middle of nowhere. Tank can't move and 300 SS troops are approaching towards them. Typical cliché scene where everybody (normal) wants to abandon tank and retreat, but no, Brad just won't do this, even if he must fight alone by himself. Naturally the rest then decide to stay(and to die like idiots).When battle starts, man just starts wondering how Germany managed to beat anyone and occupy anything with so dumb soldiers. And this is SS company, not some regular soldiers. Even they are so retarded, so they are attacking tank only from the front side practically running to the bullets. Sure they have bazookas, but why using then?!? Let just shoot the tank with machine gun. Then one blind SS soldier with IQ over 80 came to side of the tank with bazooka to try to hit it from 2 meters distance.... AND MISSED IT!!! OMG, if they are not stupid, they are totally blind.Epilogue: Long story short. Brad Pitt & Co. resisted until they are out of ammo. Brad got shot by sniper 3 or 4 times in chest, but it is just not enough for him to die. He still has time to chat with Norman then to kill one more German, more chatting... Ordinary men would die instantly, but this is Brad Pitt for God sake. Anyway acting was pretty good (3 stars are for this), but script was so awful. Cliché scenes, cliché characters. I'm truly sorry, cause this could be descent war movie.","

"thomas-w15","20 November 2014","Fury: I have seen at least two dozen different WWII movies in my life and with the exception of Saving Private Ryan, Fury is the best WWII film I have ever seen. Sergeant Wardaddy says ""Ideals are peaceful, history is violent."" This film is not for the faint of heart because it is not afraid to hold back on the brutality and utter gruesomeness that war brings to the world. Some of the images are horrifying to watch but are necessary to establish the theme of the film. I rarely see a film like this one. With ingeniously-crafted intense war scenes, strong acting across the board, and a new somewhat claustrophobic setting, a tank, Fury has become the best war film of the past five years. I had to think really hard about what I would have changed for this movie. Aside from a somewhat laughable moment where they had to find an excuse to have Brad Pitt take his shirt off, I could not find anything to criticize. Some people say this film suffers from a plot that does not seem to go anywhere, but I thought it knew exactly where it wanted to go. A soldiers life does not have a clear-cut path that he has to follow. The plot follows as such a soldier's life would go-in all directions. From what I have heard since I have never been in a war, Fury is very realistic. It does the opposite of holding back. It shows gives you the horrors of war and how soldiers have to respond to them. It has you like a character one second showing you how great they are, then shows you the character dead in a pile of rubble. It's not glorifying the Americans at all times either. It shows the pure hatred the Americans had for Germans. This is something we would all feel though and shows how one day of war can bring that hatred out of someone. The tank is also something I have never seen before. Fury is the first film to use a genuine Tiger I tank in the making of a WWII film. The tank called ""Fury"" serves as the main setting throughout the film and it is amazing the type of shots their were able to capture inside an actual tank. Outside of a couple of scenes from Indiana Jones: The Last Crusade, no other director has even come close to the scenes captured in this movie. Hats off to David Ayer!The people that served in WWII were never the same because of the experiences that had. It is very hard to actually convey this type of emotion and character in acting, but I surprised that everyone involved in the film did an incredible job. They were all perfectly casted. I know a lot of you are thinking right now ""even Shia Labeouf was good?"" Yes, as much as it pains me to say it, he had the strongest acting in the film. Even a little better than Brad Pitt which is really hard more me to say. Brad Pitt stills did a great job, and Logan Lerman easily had the best performance of his career along with Jon Bernthal and Michael Pena. Suffice to say, this movie has no shortage of outstanding acting.If you can handle some very intense war scenes and also love incredible films, I highly recommend Fury as your first choice going into the theater.

The film concentrated on the tightness of the group , the camaraderie shown to each other , they're a close knit team . As for ' we've seen it all before ' comments , well I guess you can say that about a lot of films , every film takes a little something from others , it doesn't make them bad . In this case we are shown what a Tank Crew went through in the War , what part they played , I can't remember anything like that before other than say ' Kelly's Heroes ' so from that point of view it's original . Could it have been better , well yes , could the ending have been better , well yes - but it is what it is , a damn good piece of entertainment , a rollicking adventure and that's all I ask from a film at times .","

"nadblaster","14 December 2019","The most frustrating part of this entire movie, more than anything else, is that it was so close to greatness, and let a couple of weird lapses in judgment drag it down to ""not a total waste of time but not great at all"" territory.There are lots and lots of subtle little things that this movie likes to do that elevate it above most other war movies. The sky is perpetually grey and cloudy, the times the sun shines are extremely rare, and you better believe that that was intentional. The ""good guys"", the American tankers, are barely-restrained animals, with rotting teeth, frayed clothing, permanent filth in their hair and on their faces, etc. The movie at large does a really great job of showing the more animal side of warfare, insofar as how an extended period of total warfare can twist even the most righteous person into a growling barbarian.The acting is all well above average, to the last actor. Brad Pitt is a personal favorite and as the weird, violent but caring Wardaddy he is a natural. A total prick, a fierce warrior and a harsh taskmaster, he swings between screaming, slavering killer and protective father figure. Pitt himself did a great job of showing that his character wasn't always that way; there is a scene where his civilization shines through and it's actually touching. Shia LaBoeuf does a top-notch job as the proselytizing ""straight man"", trying to stay right with God while doing as much damage to the Reich as possible. It's magical and I honestly feel that this is LaBoeuf's best performance of his life. The scenes where the tank crew jokes around and messes with one another are great and do a fantastic job of showing how close five men can get when they live, fight and die together in a closed, dark and dangerous casket like a Sherman.Why isn't this a 10/10 then? Because for all the amazing stage-setting they do, for all the trials and hardships and laughs we experience with this close-knit tank family, there are a few scenes that are so creatively and fundamentally bankrupt that they completely and utterly obliterate the setting and tone. There is a truly touching and genuinely incredible scene about halfway through the movie, and it makes you think, makes you feel, it's amazing. Then five minutes later there's a huge explosion and that scene is literally destroyed, no reason, no warning. I understand it's probably meant to show how random and senseless war can be, but I left that scene thinking ""man, what a waste of time"". Maybe it just went over my head though.Finally, I'm sure there are hundreds of other reviews about this, but the final scene is so unbelievably stupid it boggles the mind, and I am absolutely gobsmacked that this somehow made it past the scriptwriter. In fifteen short minutes all suspensions of disbelief are instantly dismantled and all the stage-setting that was done is hurled out a window. The dumbest, least sensical ending I have ever seen for a war movie, and I've seen some pretty damn dumb movies.Overall a movie worth watching, but it's more notable for how good it could have been and almost was.","

"Hollywood_Yoda","2 February 2015","In Brad Pitt's latest film, we see the final days of the war in Germany, via a tank commander and his men, circa 1945. It is in a word, Gruesome.However, very realistic in it's nature of showing the war and its effects on the men who fought. It was not pretty and romantic like the liberals want us to believe. No, the men didn't dance the night away with Hitler like so many liberal wet-dreams. It was ferocious and bloody like depicted.I am really surprised the film was SNUBBED by the Oscar committee for consideration at the 2015 Academy Awards. Why? It's a great period film, maybe not completely historical, but a great film nonetheless. Should have been at least nominated for Best Picture. Wonderful film.","

"bob-rutzel-1","28 January 2015","Tank Commander Sgt Collier (Brad Pitt) is ordered to hold an intersection so the German troops won't get thru. The problem is that the Sherman tank (Fury) is disabled and the Germans are marching their way. This can't be good.What makes this a good war story is the cinematography. It is better or on a par with all previous war movies we may have liked. No, I changed my mind as I feel it is better than all other war movies. You almost feel like you are there. That is how good the cinematography is. The photography and the details shown are incredible. Kudos.I kind of wished this was a true story and maybe it did have elements of some true stories. I mean there is nothing new under the sun (except for CGI and Star Trek type stories) and the cinematography and heroics seen gave this impression to me. Also, in the beginning we are told by notes on the screen that the German Army possessed far superior tanks than us and we know our forces will be in for the fight of their lives.The acting all around was good. No Oscars, but good. The supporting cast (Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena, Jon Bernthal) were spot on and when soldiers kill for a living and don't like anything to get in their way, they have a sort of superior attitude about everything. This showed up in spades. There was some very uncomfortable moments when Sgt Collier and Norman (Logan Lerman) the new guy to the tank crew, find a German woman and her cousin and decide to have dinner with them. Then the rest of the crew find them and well, here we go with the uncomfortable moments with these ""superior"" soldiers. Downside: The tank is immobilized. The Germans find them. The spare ammo is attached to the outside of Fury. Why is this when they know they will be in the fight of their lives? Whaaat? The Germans fire RPGs and miss. Whaaaat? Germans run in plain sight of Fury so Sgt Collier can mow them down. Whaaaaat? Two hand grenades go into Fury next to Sgt Collier and later we see Sgt Collier intact and not blown up. Whaaaat?Those were the most glaring errors or mistakes I saw. But this does not take away from the movie as a whole. There is enough tension and suspense to hold you throughout the entire movie. Keep in mind this is a movie for entertainment purposes, but it also shows us the brutality of war. When the credits run we see footage of soldiers on both sides during WWII. Again, it is the cinematography that makes this a very good war movie and yes, I did wish this was a true story, and I have to satisfy myself with knowing that some elements were true. (you said that before) (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.","

For disclaimers isn't better than Saving Private Ryan, but it doesn't try to be , it is a good War world 2 movie and if I should which WW2 film copies, that is Das Boot, but it is more that has similarities with it rather than a rip-off.To the performances ,amazing, everyone plays great their role and the commitment to the project was apparent. It said that LaBouf to be in his role he didn't was during filming and he stinted show bad that the rest of the actors couldn't be near him for long! OK that is crazy and the guy must have some issues ,but at least he showed acting skills for ones after the Tranformers apart from Lawless. Also it is in my one of the best WW2 movies after the turn of the century (But lest be honest the Pianist (2002) and Der Untergang (2004) are the best!).In any way you see it is a good War movie with great action, a fine story and characters you care about. It isn't a masterpiece , but at least is really well made and definitely you should watch it if you love WW2 flicks like me.","

"JaydoDre","19 June 2016","There is a part of the movie where the heroes come up against overwhelming odds and the leader decides to stay and tells his men to go but the men go, ""Nah, we stay with you"" as the emotional music plays in the background. Checkbox checked.Besides this cliché and a few others about how bad war is, there is unfortunately not a whole lot to this movie. ""What is this movie about?"" someone will ask. ""About a tank crew,"" I would answer. ""What does that crew do?"" ""They kill a bunch of Germans."" The sacrifice made by the main characters does not feel like it's for something. Many of the events and much of the dialogue feel forced, like the movie is looking for something of substance to add or make things seem more awesome than they are.The good part about this film is how well it is made overall. The camera work is solid. You can tell what's going on and there are plenty of epic shots. The music is epic too. It has that classic instruments foundation but it is layered with good atmospheric effects. The action feels weighty, despite the battles being fairly small scale. There is at least one really cool tank fight.The acting is good. Of course, with Brad Pit at the lead you pretty much guaranteed a solid performance but his support crew area all doing a good job as well. The Mexican character played by Michael Peña is funny but not so funny as to be overbearing. As with the rest of the movie, unfortunately there is nothing special about these guys. The naive noobie gunner at the center of the film is a walking stereotype of that type of character. The others are kind of blank. There is a scene that feels like it serves to give more background to the rest of the tank crew but it does not deliver a whole lot.Is it a very realistic war film? Well it has a scene or two that treat the enemy with a lot of respect and show the dirt of war, but the film can't help but revert to the super hero Americans theme we have grown sick of.Maybe in the end we need more movies that aren't about something. Meaningful epic movies have in themselves become a cliché. This film flows logically, looks good and doesn't overstay its welcome. If you are interested in World War II or in tanks then this is a must see.","

"tinoid","16 June 2015","Because it was excellent .. Sure, you can even find fault with the Mona Lisa if you want to but trust me she will keep smiling. This one takes you hostage to the last second. Armed to the teeth with credible, gritty and raw images of mortal combat, it made me feel like I was deep inside the belly of the beast and I could smell the iron vapor of blood, rust and gasoline. Sure, it's slightly over the top at times but hey it's a Brad Pitt production, so you shouldn't expect a dusty history lesson. The story is sturdy, the camera work and special effects really earn their stripes and the acting takes no prisoners what so ever. The picture and atmosphere of Germany in the 40's marvelously dictated. I never actually liked a single war movie. This is the first one that didn't blow up in my face and it lacked the dreaded stench of self righteous American veterans that always has me running for cover.. So don't trust the false propaganda out there and enlist to find out for yourself !","

"meritcoba","8 September 2015","Whenever a Tiger I tank and SS troops appear together in a movie you can bet the federal gold reserve on it that this movie is not about historical accuracy. This doesn't mean that Fury has no a sense of historicity, but world war II movies are actually never about world war II but about the spirit of the time they are made in. If you don't believe me, just (re)watch Kelly's Heroes and compare it to Saving Private Ryan. The spirit of Fury isn't a pretty one if we are to take our queues from the crew that operate her. During most of the movie they never display any redeeming quality; these are a truly sad crew. We have truly reached the bottom of the well as far as humanity goes. Even Apocalypse Now isn't as gloomy as this one. These are dark times were the best are the worst or the other way around. Well, not as bad as the enemy perhaps, who even hang their fellow country women for refusing to resist the invaders in a time that resistance is futile, but as bad as can be and only marginally so. The key scene is one where Brad Pitt together with Rookie invade a house where two German women hide out. It is one long protracted threat scene that screams rape with every frame. If you have seen Der Untergang, or have read the Last Battle by Cornelius Ryan, you will be aware of how these women would have felt. It isn't a pretty sight to behold. Fury has a scary anchor point, which is that it doesn't matter what you do as long as you do it because you have been told to do it and nothing else matters. It reminds me of a phrase of the game Mafia II: in the war the president pointed the finger at whom to kill, now it is the hand that pays me. This movie is thus about moral bankruptcy. In a human society there is no place for any of the crewman of Fury with an exception perhaps for the rookie who is the least tainted. Society can not work with the scumbags that war has created, and who have traded in their morals and compassion for the command: go forward and kill. They are the walking dead. It just needs a German bullet to remind them that they are.","

"sddavis63","7 December 2017","If you're looking for a deep and well developed plot, then ""Fory"" will probably disappoint. It's a very straightforward and even simple story of an American tank crew in the last days of World War II. Battle hardened and perhaps a bit cynical as a result, these Americans for the most part are not the honourable heroes that American movies usually portray. They've become as vicious as anyone else. They'll mercilessly kill their prisoners, they'll rape German women. There's repeated reflections on how bad the SS are whenever they're encountered - but under the surface there's a sense that this particular tank crew at least isn't all that much better. They kill indiscriminately, with little hesitation and few attacks of conscience. It's all to paint a broad picture of war as brutal and ugly. It dehumanizes warriors, turning them int killing machines. It's a very bloody and graphic and violent movie, featuring some of the most vicious tank battles I've ever come across on film. It isn't a movie that's going to give you the warm fuzzies, nor does it create heroes. It's not a very likable movie - and yet, I enjoyed it.First, I liked the lead performances from Brad Pitt as Sgt. Collier (the commander of the tank crew) and Logan Lerman as Norman (a clerk typist who somehow got assigned to tank duty. Logan was not welcomed or respected by the crew. He didn't want to kill; he didn't really want to fight. He wanted to type. He still saw the Germans as people rather than enemies. I liked the portrayal of the bond that developed between Collier and Norman. Collier took him under his wing in a sense - protected him somewhat from the abuse of the crew and treated him decently, all the while preparing him for war. Norman gradually evolves and - sadly in some ways - by the end of the movie becomes a savage warrior like the others. I found myself kind of wanting Norman to stay more human; his gradual transformation was a little bit sad. The rest of the tank crew (played by actors like Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal) were pretty one dimensional.The best scenes of the movie are probably in the German apartment where Collier and Norman hook up with two German women - one of whom seemed very young and innocent - much like Norman, actually. There's a tension to those scenes. Norman takes her into a bedroom and we assume they have sex - but it didn't seem to be a savage rape. This was Norman. The two seemed genuinely to like each other and found something with each other in the midst of the insanity around them. The girl's death as a civilian casualty when the Americans are attacked seems to be the turning point for Norman.As I said, this is a pretty simple and straightforward movie - but it does have some good moments of reflection and humanity.

"jagreen70","5 November 2014","I recently saw the new movie ""Fury"" with Brad Pitt, and keep reading how ""realistic"" it is supposed to be. Here is my take on this movie (SPOILERS): Brad Pitt plays a psychotic tank platoon sergeant who kills an unarmed, clearly surrendering POW to teach a new tank crew member ""how to kill"". No officers or senior NCOs make any effort to stop him. His company commander next gives him an important mission for his tank platoon. On this mission, thru poor crew discipline, poor road march discipline, and very bad tank tactics ends up getting his entire platoon wiped out. If you look closely, this movie is just a very cynical version of ""Saving Private Ryan"" with some ""Cross of Iron"" thrown in. It reminds me of those ""Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos"" comic books of the 60's, and the end is very similar to the ""Ghost Tank"" story lines in that comic book. In fact, I suspect strongly that this scrip started out as a film script version of that comic book. The vast majority of the real members of the 2nd Armored Division were not psychopaths, and by April 1945 they had very good discipline and knowledge of tank tactics. Despite the hype, this is another case of Hollywood WW II, not the real one. Brad Pitt's character needs to be given a Section 8.","

"petarmatic","14 January 2015","I saw many WWII films but this one is very high on my list. It has action, and good plot, acting is excellent, not the forget visual and special effects. Especially I like editing, which I understand this film obtained some awards about it.My main question is, of course, is it historically accurate. I talked to some people who participated in WWII during tank battles in the western front, and they told me there are some accurate elements, on the other hand there are some which were not that accurate. For example, they do not believe that crew of one tank could of held for so long on its own, other is for example young German soldier leaving alive young American soldier who was hiding under the tank.Altogether, I think really had fun watching this film, and I would recommend that you watch it too. Two thumbs up!","

And honestly, while watching it, i was on edge for a good portion of it.There is some truth to me saying ""little to no backstory"", and that means there is a bit of backstory missing from some characters. But, there is enough main story to make the backstory obsolete. The main story is really interesting, and it was really unpredictable. The only thing you can do is wonder whats gonna happen next. And yes, there are epic battles.An interesting side note: The tanks used in the movie are real tanks lent from museums.All in all, a really cool movie that is worth a watch.","

"Fluke_Skywalker","17 October 2014","Though it can't seem to avoid dusting off nearly every war movie cliché imaginable, 'Fury' is well made, well acted and features some of the most white-knuckle battle action ever captured on film.The still somehow underrated Brad Pitt commands the screen just as his character Wardaddy commands his men. It would've been easy for Pitt to simply give in to caricature here, but he's become much too fine an actor for that. The rest of his men are more than equal to the task of overcoming their stock characters, particularly star in the making Logan Lerman.'Fury' is no flag-waver, yet it also never strays into the realm of moral relativism that typically plagues modern war films. Instead any message fittingly gets lost in the haze of battle.","

"lesleyharris30","2 May 2015","Fury is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a brilliant cast. It's a fine war movie that is intense from start to finish and, I feel, it captured Germany during the second World War very well. However, it definitely thinks it's better than what it is, judging from the actors portrayal of the characters and the music that accompanies it, they were all expecting this movie to become the next Schindler's List or Apocalypse Now, but the story and overall the acting simply wasn't strong enough to have a lasting effect on me as those movies did. Brad Pitt is in great form as Wardaddy and if it wasn't for him I would be giving this a lower rating, I felt the other four men overacted, but Pitt was real, I felt for this character and believed he was a real person, when an actor can do that you know they're doing a good job. It has its flaws, but Fury is still a powerful and intense film that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or war movie. An army sergeant leads four men in a tank through Nazi Germany as the second World War approaches an end. Best Performance: Brad Pitt Worst Performance: Jon Bernthal","

"PyroSikTh","28 October 2014","Fury is a war movie with many war movie tropes and clichés. The cast of characters, for example, is one big cliché; there's the hardened veteran who's respected by everyone he commands, the Christian guy who keeps spouting bible verses, the bulldog who is so brimming with testosterone that he almost becomes a parody of himself, the Mexican who keeps getting told off for speaking Spanish, and of course the new recruit that they all bully until he proves himself worthy of their respect. So it's interesting that the movie decides to take a character-driven approach seeing as all the main characters are shallow stereotypes. Fortunately it kind of works in being a vehicle for the movie's themes.The biggest theme of the whole movie is certainly anti-war. It shows the brutality of it in all it's gory and psychological glory. It's a heavy movie to watch, both visually and emotionally, and that cast of characters are what helps push this along. But first the gore and violence. I mean, it's a war movie, this level of violence comes with the territory, however I'm shocked this got such a low rating (15 in the UK). The new recruit's first task is to clean up the mess of the guy he's replacing, whereupon he finds half the guy's face splat on the wall. The journey to his first mission ends up with their lieutenant getting set on fire and ultimately shooting himself in the head to make the pain stop. Yeah, this isn't a movie for the light-stomached.But back to the character focus and how it aids the themes. While the movie might be visually challenging to watch thanks to all the gore and violence, it's also hard to watch because of the emotions and psychology at play. It's these emotional situations that really lift the characters out of their pigeon-holed stereotypes. Again, focussing on the new recruit who was never trained with a weapon or how to kill, he struggles to kill the German soldiers. Taking a life is taking a life even if it is a you-or-me situation, and he's adamant to keep his conscious clean. He's also bullied on by the other members of his crew because of his ""weak"" mental state, when in actual fact it's them who have grown apathetic and desensitised to the horrors of war.The acting is the single-biggest driving factor of the movie. The characters may be weak, the plot simple, and the themes and ideas mishandled, but the sheer quality of acting on display makes sure that you never really notice how weak the characters are. Each and every actor shares a great chemistry with his fellows that instantly lends to these four guys having been together as long as they claim. Each one also manages to individually add a surprising depth to their otherwise two-dimensional characters. Brad Pitt's Don is indeed the hardened veteran he's made out to be, wise and commanding respect wherever he goes even though he's not the highest ranking soldier. However he is also a bully, running Norman hard and against his ideologies. But he's human as well. He's respected because he's a nice guy deep down and he's committed to his cause. A two-dimensional character he is not.Every major character is given this same amount of depth by their actor. Logan Lerman's Norman may be the weedy greenhorn, but he's not a pushover nor is he socially challenged. He often goes toe-to-toe with the other members of his crew, giving as much as he takes, in defence of his stance. Shia LaBeouf's Bible (the Christian, if you couldn't tell) isn't your regular goody two- shoes that type of character is often portrayed as. He doesn't join in with the bullying as much, but he doesn't do anything to stop it, and in fact sides with his crewmembers even when they're being unreasonable. Of all the crew though, he's the one who gets most attached, so whenever another crew member dies, he's the one to add that emotional weight. I don't care what anyone says, LaBeouf is an astounding actor that deserves more credit - personal life be screwed. Jon Bernthal's animalistic Grady is every bit as macho (and slightly dumb) as his stereotype requires, but is again still human. He never quite reaches into parody land, and his short heart-to-heart with Norman near the end goes a long way to show that he's not just a brute. Michael Peña unfortunately gets the short end of the stick with the under-developed Gordo. Much like his Mexican stereotype, that's about all that's particularly memorable about him, and other than straggling the line between Bible's good nature and Grady's masculinity like a happy medium, he doesn't have a particularly well-carved out role within the crew (other than being the driver).Fury is a suspense-filled, nail-biting war movie that will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat. It's the first movie I've seen that gives proper credit to the armoured regiments and this alone makes it stand out from the sea of WWII movies that are out there. The characters are weak, but the fantastic acting gives them the added dimensions they need, and the messages and themes are good and come across really well, but they sometimes become a detriment to the overall movie. Critically, Fury is a movie with many faults deserving of no more than a ""good"" 7/10, although I personally enjoyed it enough to maybe have rated it higher.","

"Laakbaar","1 November 2014","This is somewhat of an overwhelming movie. It shows the last ""total war"" at its most desperate. We see -- no, we smell – the excitement and the horrors experienced by a single tank crew. This movie jolts you into realizing that much of what we've seen on the screen over the last 70 years about this war has become cliché. Most of those who lived through the war are dead and we can now dare to imagine what it really must have been like and tell stories that we didn't dare tell before. These men were both heroes and ""inglorious basterds"". Surely that's the way it was. The movie clichés are trotted out and then dealt with brutally.A cinematic decision was made to show everything. In modern times, we need to see this to understand what total war is like. These are the things your granddad and dad refused to talk about. But if you're squeamish, be warned. Further, this movie provoked a huge emotional response in me. Bring a hankie. Yes, sweat, blood and tears -- this movie is an experience.I have never seen armoured operations, tank battles and tank activities so well depicted on film, However, the German military seemed strangely ineffective at times. I suppose this was to give the film dramatic tension and showcase our heroes. It felt artificial. Pitt and Lerman are very good, but it was Shia LaBoeuf who really shone. What a fine actor. This was a larger than life tank crew (something unavoidable when Pitt and LaBoeuf are in your tank). It bothered me a little that this crew was so ragtag and maverick. Hollywood loves this kind of thing, but it is not realistic. Some of the scenes involving the interaction between the sergeant and the newbie also seemed unrealistic. But the decision to tell this story more or less through the eyes of Lerman's character was brilliant. Sensitive, intelligent, conscientious, not combat trained, lacking acculturation to military life and battle, his main asset is the ability to type 60 words a minute. Now if this doesn't speak directly to the hipster-reddit-twitter generation, nothing does. Norman Ellison is a young man from the 2010s, not the 1940s. It worked very effectively. I'm glad they referenced the Falaise Gap. Now THAT might be a movieHighly recommended!","

"nmholland","13 May 2016","Fury is directed by David Ayer and stars Brad Pitt as Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier, the leader of an American World War II tank squad. During this time, German tanks were very superior that of the American models, so being in a tank squad was a hard job to commit to. However, once Logan Lerman's character, a drafted clerk named Norman, is assigned to Wardaddy's tank squad, he learns the true nature of war, and just some of the horrible things humans can do to one another. I would, in a heartbeat, call Fury one of the best war films ever made. Fury almost perfectly follows in the footsteps of other legendary war films such as Saving Private Ryan (1998) and Platoon (1986), which are both recognized as amazing feats in filmmaking. Fury is very close to perfect, and does almost everything right. Besides one very small issue, I loved every single minute of Fury, and felt that it's a fantastic movie.The absolute best thing about Fury is the comradery between the men in the tank squad. The close friendship between Wardaddy (Pitt), Bible (Shia LaBeouf), Gordo (Michael Pena), Coon-A*s (Jon Bernthal), and, eventually, Norman (Lerman) is incredible. Due to the comradery expressed between the men, the audience begins to feel for each and every character, and have large amounts of both sorrow and pity on their behalfs. All of the actors do great as well. Fury is Logan Lerman's best work to date, being slightly better than that of his performance in The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012), and way better than the Percy Jackson series. Brad Pitt also does amazing, as usual, along with Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal. Although I don't like him as an actor, I do have to say that Shia LaBeouf did really good in his role. His character was near flawlessly well rounded, and I felt for him and his situation.The direction, by David Ayer, is amazing. Each and every shot of just how grotesque and awful war really is was shown magnificently, and brought a harsh realness to Fury. Also, however small the tank may be, the direction impressively seemed to enlarge it, as if there was actually room for five grown men to live regularly. The tank, called ""Fury,"" is given the feel of a home, and begins to feel comforting to both the characters and the audience. However, it also feels claustrophobic, which was a great movie on Ayer's part. While giving the tank room to open up, it also felt very closed, which was a great aspect of Fury.My only real problem with Fury was a small portion in the middle of the second act in which roughly twenty minutes of the runtime takes place in one small apartment. Although we learn insightful things about our characters, and the scene does feel necessary, it tends to drag on incredibly, near boring the viewer, and makes the film seem a lot longer than it actually is. This sequence was good, no doubt about it, but it was too long, and dragged on to the point of slight exasperation.The last point I'll make about Fury is the gruesome aspect of it. Although some people can't handle over the top violence, Fury goes for the R rating with open arms. The war violence is over the top, almost to the point of insanity, but it gives a realistic feel to the film, as well as adding some gut wrenching scenes of death and destruction. Not everyone likes violence in movies, and that's understandable, but, for a war film like Fury, it works in every way possible. The extreme violence is acceptable for Fury, because of the point it tries to express: war is bad. War is disgusting, grotesque, and not a pretty thing. However, as humans, we have to accept that as a fact of life. This message is wonderfully displayed through the utmost violence and death.Overall, Fury really is a great movie. Almost everything about it works in a positive way, and there's much enjoyment, and a good message, to be had in it. I'd recommend Fury to anyone who can handle a large amount of war violence.","

I'm talking about not being able to hit a tank from just yards away. I'm not kidding. Also they had a nasty habit of running straight into machinegun fire instead of just going around or in back of a broken down tank where it was perfectly safe. Weird. I also learned Brad Pitt can take 3 shots to the chest AND 2 grenades exploding practically in his lap and STILL NOT DIE!!! Amazing. Also it's OK to kidnap two German women because...um...you're the good guys...? I guess?... Oh, and let's not forget that it's perfectly OK to murder an enemy prisoner as long as you are doing it to teach the new guy an important lesson about ..you know....war stuff. I learned all this and so much more from Fury. Hope you did too. One star. This movie was about as much fun as a root canal. You've been warned.","

"Cinemaniac1984","25 January 2015","Fury is another war movie that does not hold back on showing the horrors of war and its unflinchingly graphic violence. The violence is certainly not over the top nor does it have graphic violence for the sake of it. It is real and it shows the viewer that war is hell, and in no way should the makers of the movie apologise or have to justify themselves for exhibiting such graphic violence. Fury may not be right up there with such classic war movies as Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now or Platoon, but its still an entertaining and enjoyable war movie.Brad Pitt is the hardened and battle weary tank commander Sgt Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier who has been responsible for leading his tank affectionately named Fury as well as his crew through many campaigns in World War II. His experienced crew includes the deeply religious and God-fearing Boyd ""Bible"" Swan (Shia LaBeouf), the tank driver Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia (Michael Pena), and the vicious and volatile Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis (Jon Bernthal). After one of their crew members is killed, a fresh-faced Army Clerk Norman ""Machine"" Ellison (Logan Lerman) who has not been in combat is called in as a replacement and dropped right into a baptism of fire. The crew at first treat Norman with disdain and contempt , but once Norman is able to overcome his fears and proves himself in battle, the men start to treat him like one of their own.Brad Pitt shows that age 50, age will not weary him and he still shows the same clout as a box office draw card that he has always possessed throughout his career. Shia LaBeouf may be regarded as a person who is not quite right away from the cameras, but in Fury all that is put aside as he puts in a very likable performance as ""Bible"". Logan Lerman is a standout as the Army Clerk inexperienced on the battlefield but gradually becomes hardened by the horrors of war and shows that he has an intense hatred for the enemy. Michael Pena is always a likable actor no matter what movie he is in. Jon Bernthal of The Walking Dead fame came across as very unlikeable and volatile, but after a while he shows that he is a human being who has almost lost his humanity through the horrors of the war.Director David Ayer (Street Kings, End of Watch) does a great job bringing Fury to life with Brad Pitt and the rest of the cast as well as the story that has you hooked from start to finish. David Ayer also hammers home the message that war is hell and affects everybody on the battlefield.Although Fury does not reach the same groundbreaking cinematic heights as other classic war movies, nonetheless it is still an entertaining movie that is highly recommended.8/10","

On paper, the film feels like it could be a tad formulaic and generic but the end product was something really intense and filled with great acting by the entire cast. Granted, my only complaints about the film are I wanted more development from a couple of the characters and due to its length and shocking visuals, I'm probably not going to watch this a lot in my lifetime and the replay value might be a tad low but, beyond this, I really dug the film.","

"oscar-35","27 October 2014","*Spoiler/plot- Fury, 2014. Film follows a 2nd Armored ""Hell on Wheels' Division tank crew invading Germany near the end of the European Theater April 1945. The Sherman tank crew has been together since North Africa, but has recently lost a crew mate. They receive a untrained reluctant replacement soldier who causes problems for the tank crew and needs to adapt to his new job as assistant driver. Drama ensues.*Special Stars- Brad Pitt, Shia LeBoeuf, Logan Lerman, Michael Pena, Jon Bernthal, Scott Eastwood.*Theme- War is serious and important work.*Trivia/location/goofs- Filmed in England. Fury marks the first time a genuine Tiger I tank has been used in the production of a WWII film. Fury features ""Tiger 131"" from the UK's Bovington Tank Museum, the only fully functioning Tiger tank in the world. Shia Lebeouf reportedly pulled out his own tooth and did not shower during filming. Fury is about the U.S. 2nd Armored division. The 2nd Armored is also known as ""Hell on Wheels"". The Assault Rifle carried by Brad Pitt is a German made StG 44 also known as a Sturmgewehr 44. A gun personally approved by Adolf Hitler for his SS troops. The fight with the Tiger tank clearly shows rounds from the Sherman tank guns bouncing off the Tiger's frontal armor. The L40 76mm M1A2 gun mounted on Fury was easily capable of penetrating the front armor of a Tiger tank at ranges of 400 to 700 meters. The fight was clearly under 200 meters, at which range the rounds from the 2 76mm armed Sherman tanks would have penetrated the Tiger's frontal armor. An experienced tank commander would attack the Tiger from the side, where the armor was only 60mm thick, rather than from the rear, where it was 80mm.e GOOFS: The mouths of the Waffen SS troops are not singing during that road marching scene to the crossroads were 'Fury' was stopped by an German anti-tank mine.*Emotion- An extremely well produced and acted story about how tank crews bonded, died, and fought in Europe. Good demonstration of era tank tactics and daily life.*Based On- Loosesly based on many Allied tank commander's experiences in WW2.","

"covingka","18 June 2020","I like movies that have heart. Guess I'm a sucker for the light in the darkness aspect that these kinds of movies sometimes sneak into the story. I enjoyed this film, but it didn't have that element.*Spoilers Below*Norman, young, green, and terrified, shares a look of love with a beautiful young German girl who moved out out the way of the tanks with her bike. This kind scene- with their eyes meeting and communicating so much h- is typical of the love at first type moment. I mean she was just beautiful and he was clearly enamored. Not only is the moment interrupted by the crudest of jokes, but we not 15 mins later see that she's been hung by the Nazis. I was disappointed there wasn't going to be a future with her.Next, he falls fast for an equally beautiful girl at a house him and Wardaddy come across in a town they take. They are clearly taken with each other, and are distraught when they must part. Maybe he can get back to her after all the dying is over? The war is almost over anyway.... Sadly, no. Not ten minutes after their separation, we see her lying in a pile of rubble, dead.As others have pointed out, this movie tells a message. There are war heroes, but nothing is heroic or romantic about war itself. There is light in the darkness (of war), but the darkness will snuff it out shortly.There is nothing in this movie that is redeemed. Nothing salvaged. It just ends.","

"SnoopyStyle","5 March 2015","It's April 1945. The Americans are making the final push into Germany. Don Collier (Brad Pitt) commands his Sherman tank with his war-weary crew Boyd Swan (Shia LaBeouf), Trini Garcia (Michael Peña) and Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal). Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) is a green recruit destine for clerical work when he's push onto Collier to replace his dead assistant driver.What David Ayer gives is an ugly portrait of war. There is no prettying up these characters or these situations. They are worn down to their animal cores. Some may be displeased at an American soldier killing a prisoner. The most disturbing is the approval of all the soldiers around them. This is not heroic at times putting survival above all else. Yet at other time, it is heroism at its highest. The blood and mud is easy. The acting is the hard part. The four hard worn veterans have the dark animalistic feel. Logan Lerman gets to grow his character. They all get that dirty feel of war. The story is a bit predictable with the third act playing out without much surprise. Nevertheless, it is a compelling watch all the way to the end.","

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","12 May 2016","David Ayer's Fury is the most fearsome, unrelenting war film of the decade and quite the experience to sit through. One stumbles out of the theatre as shell shocked as the brave soldiers we've just witnessed on screen, needing time to wind down from the horror, after which we realize that among the thunderous bravura and non stop, head shattering combat are moments of tender humanity and ponderous reflection, just enough to contrast the madness. Logan Lerman has the pretty boy look, which is quickly stripped away and replaced by frenzied terror and confusion, playing a young army clerk who hasn't seen one second of combat, suddenly tasked with joining the ranks of a tank warfare crew. They are each hardened in their own way by what they've seen and done. Brad Pitt is Wardaddy, their iron jawed commander in a gritty, unstable and altogether brilliant performance. Jon Bernthal is the obligatory redneck Neanderthal, a big lug whose brutish ways mask a childlike yearning beneath. Shia Leboeuf is the restrained one, a bible reader and thinker whose resentment of the war radiates from his eyes like sad and sick beams of sympathy. Michael Pena, reliably excellent, is the closest to neutral of the group. Ayer airdrops us right into the action without pretext, warning or proclaimed intention. This isn't a 'men on a mission' war flick, this is a single harrowing day in the lives of men at the end of the world as well as their ropes, an intimate study of the horror inflicted on both body and soul, both soldier and civilian, the collective horrific impact of the war refracted through the prism of a small period of time. Such a tactic has huge potential, and here it works wonders in brining us closer to these characters, as well as anyone they meet along their way. Pitt leads this ragtag band with the indifferent sentiment of a hardened, brittle man who has been in one too many a tight spot and seen one too many a comrade fall under his care to waste time with compassion for the enemy. Time and tide have turned killing into a purely instinctual, second nature business for him, and we see this unfold in a kicker of a scene where he forces Lerman to murder an unarmed German private who begs for his life. Such is war, and such is Ayer's film, free from Hallmark moments and structured escapism. Midway through, the film stops dead in its tracks for a beautiful, tension filled sequence in which the band finds temporary refuge in crumbling abode with two German girls. The culture shock is numbed out by the extremity of the war, and these two groups are forced to coexist, if only for an hour or so. The youngest of the girls (Alicia Von Rittberg) is stunning, a baleful example of the corrupts of innocence, her character arc a testament to the senselessness of war. The combat scenes within the tank clank with clammy, claustrophobic dread and desperation, helped by the fact that for the most part they filmed inside real replicas. Jason Isaacs shows up in yet another war movie role as a grizzled commander who briefly assists them, and (of course) steals his two quick scenes in the process. War films often struggle to find humanity amongst the ugliness y trying a little too hard, and by being a little too obvious. This one is frank, unrelenting and assaults you with a deafening roar of chaos, with a few extremely subtle moments of introspect and emotion. It may just have cracked the formula for finding the comfort in such turmoil: less is more. One of the best war movies I've ever seen.","

"aylwardpaul","26 June 2022","Could have been a good war film, but it is completely ruined by the ridiculous final battle.As if an elite experienced battle hardened German unit is going to attack a stationary incapacitated tank head on.And how nice of them to pause their attack every time a member of the allied tank crew is killed or wounded.Films are better when you show some respect for the opposition.What we have here is the equivalent of an old western movie, where the indians are shown to ride pointlessly around circled wagons for no purpose other than to get shot.This film is watchable for the decent production values and battle effects, but it is just too dumb to rate higher than 6.","

"Troy_Campbell","25 October 2014","Following a tank crew on their trek through Germany, this WWII saga is a mixed bag; it has a list of flaws as long as a small novel, however it also has energy, intensity and acting prowess to burn. David Ayer (End of Watch, Street Kings, Sabotage) has always been a take-it-or- leave-it type of filmmaker that has split critical opinion, and his latest won't change minds on either side of the Ayer-fence. A mishmash tone that swings from earnest war drama to Hollywood action flick and a propensity to linger too long on certain scenes are the primary faults that stop this motion picture from soaring. Yet somehow it still comes out the other end as a largely entertaining and gripping film with glimpses of brilliance. There are two tank battle set pieces that are utterly enthralling and showcase Ayer's obvious skill for action, whilst Roman Vasyanov's magnificent cinematography – all gloomy clouds and dirty, muddy realism – brings a sombre atmosphere that lends the film an extra layer of gravitas. Ultimately, though, this a showcase for the ensemble cast to shine. Brad Pitt is commanding as the gruff and uncompromising tank leader who just wants to keep his men alive; Shia LeBeouf defies the Shia-haters with an impressive turn as Pitt's emotional right-hand man; Logan Lerman delivers the finest performance of his burgeoning career as the inexperienced newby; and Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal round out the gang solidly. Despite not being the Saving Private Ryan of 2014 it could have been, Fury remains a tense and occasionally fascinating cinematic experience.","

"Eddie_weinbauer","29 November 2014","FuryAnother slightly more gritty Hollywood movie, about how the Yankees won the war all alone. I never liked brad pit as a sole lead carrying actor. Simply cause I have never seen him play lead in anything worth watching. I've seen movies where does a good job, by all means. But he was never the lead in those movies, he starred alongside actors bigger and better than him. That's not the case her. This movie they have gathered a bunch of B/C grade actors (seriously. Who the H*ll, cast Shia LaBeouf in anything serious?? The guy played in transformers for Christ sake) But brad Pitt is suppose to carry this film on he's: I'm-a -larger-than-life- seen it-all-bad ass-war-veteran,with a thousand-yard stare look. The problem is,he's not believable, not even remotely He's too baby faced, and don't really have what it takes to play those types of roles, which for me he proved pretty much in Inglorious bastard. He look like someone impersonating a war movie character. It gets stupefying when they portray the Sherman's as a super tank,that can go head to head with a tiger. It was a piece of sh*t casserole with a gun turret, and everybody knew it. The Sherman was simply not created for Tank vs Tank fight. The Tigers would have turned them into pot stew in 5 minutesI've seen interviews with the poor people who drove Shermans,were they stated that it was no match for the German Tigers. So when a Sherman takes up to 3 direct hits from a tiger at close range, and the shell just bounces off,then you start laughing. Its just too stupid and unbelievable. It gets even more amusing when there's German artillery coming out of nowhere and manage to pulverize everything all around their position,but not one tank. Especially when they stand in a town square surrounded by buildings that get blown to pieces. I find it a bit amusing that they seem to have unlimited ammo. Cause whenever they face a sniper or an ambush by machine gun, they just load the main gun, and blow em away. Every little problem they have, they just load up the main gun and blow it up. Though as other have stated its a truly gritty movie, the poor acting,the missing story line,and the gaping plot holes just destroys it. They don't use tactics, everything is just charge forward come what may,guns blazing etc. And the story line is none existent. This would have gone straight for DVD if it wasn't for brad pit***************Warning spoilers************************** There a scene were their tank hit a mine in a middle of a muddy road. Yet they don't advance carefully. They just jump down of the tank,and walk around without a care in the world. I know antitank mines usually require some heavy pressure, but I believe soldiers would still be weary about walking around them. And what was the big show down at the end all about?Brad holding this big speech about holding the crossroad come hell or high water. It's a cross road in the middle of nowhere,and holds no strategic purpose whatsoever. The German could actually just walk around it,because there were nothing but open fields as far as the eye could see.. 300 Germans with panzerfaust,against one broken down Sherman...Only in Hollywood And the Germans crack soldiers just wanders aimlessly around while under fire,just so he can get moved down,at one point it almost looks like the Germans are lining up juts to be shot down.300 Germans with panzerfaust,can't win against one broken down Sherman...Only in Hollywood","

"socrates99","29 January 2015","Having been around awhile I've seen my share of war movies. Back in the last century most were about triumphant, courageous types who were luckier than lottery winners. Bullets always seemed to just miss them while their shots almost always hit the mark. It was a simpler, more simple-minded, time. I think 'Fury' would have appalled 'the greatest generation' having been weaned on John Wayne and Audie Murphy.There's no way to explain it. Brad Pitt and Shia LaBeouf have a better grasp of warfare than your average recruiting sergeant. Their performances here evoke a better sense of battle and war than any I've seen. And I felt as if they were bringing to life exactly what needed to be seen: those scenes between brothers in arms that 99% of soldiers know, no one will ever know or understand.It's a terrifying movie to watch and I'm glad I didn't catch it until the DVD came out. I was able to stop it when it got too intense which was a couple of times. Every performance is beautifully delivered and that's a miracle too. How did the director get these young men to understand what most men never will? It's beyond me.This story is a moving experience but probably not destined to be everyone's favorite, especially women. The only scenes not hip deep in war are shocking and disturbing because they involve men with women under the worst of circumstances. The battle scenes make sense and yet there's no hint they're somehow contrived. That in itself is a unique achievement.I haven't seen 'American Sniper' yet but if it's even half as good as this I'll be quite happy.","

"captainmike-michael","2 November 2014","Taking place nearly the same time frame and running at almost the same time length, the film does not progress as artistically bored as Inglorious Basterds, but the focus on the WW2 action flick on the ground through a tank somehow surprisingly entertaining. The screenplay does not focus on a political trick between those big countries involved in this historical world war, but mostly on the firing battle between the armies. It heavily narrates the physical and mental torture of the soldiers in this hell-like battleship, arguing the right and wrong humanity subjects, stresses on the horror and darkness consequences of war towards those heroes who fight rather than questioning their heroic aspects. The emphasis on character development, charismatic performance from Brad Pitt as always, surprisingly big improvement of Logan Lerman from Percy Jackson to Norman with strong humanity and the thrilling scores from Steven Price all added up making Fury as one of the best war film in this recent decade.","

"CinemaClown","12 November 2014","When it comes to depicting the brutal horrors of war, Fury does a commendable job in offering a visceral outlook through its numerous battle sequences that are relentless, unflinching & unforgiving yet the film as a whole feels more or less like a missed opportunity because despite having the potential & ingredients to join the same league as the finest examples of its genre, it comfortably settles for a score that's quite below its aspirations.A fictional story set during the final months of World War II in Nazi Germany, Fury presents a fascinating portrait of tank crews that served during the last great war and concerns the battle- hardened five-man crew of a Sherman tank & the deadly mission they embark on behind enemy lines. The film covers the bonding between the crews & the team effort they put together in a heroic attempt to hold their position despite being heavily outnumbered & outgunned.Written & directed by David Ayer, the movie makes it pretty clear in its opening moments that it aims to put up a mercilessly raw depiction of war in front of viewers & isn't going to be a nice ride for the easily distressed. Ayer's direction & script are really good in parts but where the movie falls flat is in the moments when bullets & shells are not being exchanged. However, camera-work is kinetic, editing is effective in battle scenes but choppy rest of the time & background score is a big plus.Coming to the performances, the main cast comprises of Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Peña & John Bernthal as the five-man crew of the Sherman tank named 'Fury' and it's Pitt as Wardaddy who really has a commanding presence here & delivers a fab performance yet sometimes his star presence comes in the way. LaBeouf is surprisingly good, Lerman's character is our ticket into the battlefield & his bonding with Wardaddy is the core ingredient that drives this story. And I didn't care much damn about Peña & Bernthal.On an overall scale, Fury features a relatively less used premise in warfare filmmaking as there aren't many examples in cinema that have captured war from the viewpoint of a tank crew & in that aspect, is a welcome addition. But it is also ridden with almost every cliché of its genre, fails to provide a more compact structure to its narrative & certainly lacks the same level of devotion in handling its characters' arcs as the one present while it is revelling in its extremity. Not even close to the finest films of its genre but a viciously entertaining ride nonetheless. Worth a shot.","

Also the final scene was a bit off and unrealistic ,,, yeah there were a lot of survivors in ww2 but this way was a cliché.To the Cast ... amazing performance by All,, every one was in the tank made a freaking amazing performance .. everyone of them had his own character , his own story.The Cinematography and visual effects were amazing ,, yeah in some scenes it was over the top but still gave it more glamour ;)If i wanna be honest,, the movie overall was okay ,, i don't know if it's based on a true story even thou i tend to think it's not... it all worked out in the end .. ...

"rgkarim","18 October 2014","World War II is a time of tragedy, dismay, horror, and for Hollywood an opportunity to make movies. We've seen this historical time period represented in so many ways that you wonder what battle, or aspect we have left to cover. This weekend, the historical archives have been rooted once again, to deliver to us the tales of tank battle warfare. My review is on Fury, the action thriller released this weekend to most major theaters. With all the premovie showings and Hollywood exclusives, I was curious as to what the design team had in store for me. What's my verdict? Sit back, relax, and read my review. Where to start? I guess on the first big strength of the film, the action. This movie contains a bountiful number of intense battles in the German countryside. These exciting and suspenseful bouts of metal behemoth chaos are filled with enough explosions and special effects to make Michael Bay jealous, though in this case they are actually relevant. Audience members will be brought into the full experience with the incredible editing of the audio effects, as bombs, bullets, and the likes soar through the theater. You might be thinking, big deal I have plenty of movies that give me a similar experience. What's so great about this movie? For this reviewer, most movies don't bring you into the full tank experience. Fury plops us into the mechanisms of tank warfare, showing us the inner workings and the teamwork required to full operate the instrument of death. Each team member, or cast in this case, plays an integral cog in the maintenance of the metal monster, and one gets to feel they are working alongside them the whole time. In addition, the battles have strategy behind them as well, each fight having a different element and target than the last. While the colored bullets of green and red were a bit ridiculous, Star Wars anyone, it didn't take too much away from the thrill that was Fury's action shots. Action is only one element of the experience though, for it's the motley crew assembled that adds more depth to the movie. Leading the cast is popular heart throb Brad Pitt playing Don the commander at large. Pitt does his role well, the stalwart general who puts up with little crap to the point of being a jerk seems to be a natural part for him to play. Yet, somehow he plays the paternal role to the group and has that softer side that makes him likable. Batting second in command is Shia LaBeouf who finally left the artificially created Autobots to fight a war on his own. LaBeouf surprised me with his performance, a character who was grounded yet not afraid to fight off the enemy. His pipes from Transformers were put to good use in this film, his screams actually relevant to battle instead of calling for Optimus. Such a mature role was a welcome asset to the film, and I look forward to seeing more of these in the future. Logan Lerman has also graduated to a more mature role, and was a good character to play Norman the typist dropped into the horror that is war. Lerman's character makes a lot of transitions through this movie, and the young actor did a nice job portraying the struggles of a rookie in war. While the evolution into a Nazi killing machine was rather sudden, I think Lerman handled the emotions well and kept them in control. As for Michael Peña and Jon Bernthal, they too did a nice job as supporting character, playing the more aggressive and blunt tank soldiers that represent the animals men can become in the heat of battle. Regardless, the chemistry between this team was phenomenal, almost as if they were truly brothers of war and they were a team forged by battle. As for the problems with the film, they start with the character development. Fury's character development was rather poor at points. Yes, we got to see emotions and outlooks of each member towards the Nazi's, but aside from that the history of the soldiers was left in mystery. Pitt's panic attacks went unexplained, the pictures and backstory's of the other crew, pretty much nonexistent. In truth only Lerman's character had any real development, and that was due to him evolving into a true solider. This ambiguous nature made the characters a little one dimensional for this reviewer, and in truth a little hard to latch onto. In addition to this weakness, the next flaw in the movie is some of the scenes they put into the fray. Fury has a span of almost forty minutes of pure, boring, unnecessary downtime. As my buddy pointed out it was to relieve some tension and give some character development, but it failed for me and left me half asleep at points. Some post editing could, or scene directing I felt is needed to make a more relevant, and quicker, attempt to get some depth to our team. As for the ending, it leaves you a little cheated, proud at what unfolded, but at the same time disappointed by the inconclusive ending. There are a few other things that are a bit picky, but let's wrap this review up shall we?Fury is a great war story, filled with excitement, emotions, and brotherhood. I warn families to exercise caution with taking their younger family members to this, because it is bloody, filled with vulgar language, and intense. The battles themselves are merit enough to see this one in theaters, but the flaws I mentioned do take a way from the movie itself. It's no Saving Private Ryan, but Fury is a nice change up from the genres that seem to flood the theater. My scores for this film are:Action/Drama/War: 8.5-9.0 Movie Overall 7.5-8.0","

"Boristhemoggy","12 February 2024","In April 1945, as the Allies make their final push in the European Theater, a battle-hardened Army sergeant named Wardaddy commands a five-man Sherman tank crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. Outnumbered, out-gunned, and with a rookie soldier thrust into their platoon, Wardaddy and his men face overwhelming odds in their heroic attempts to defend a field hospital from Waffen SS troops.Fury, like most war films, shows the utter 'fury' and brutality of war, and glorifies it as heroic and patriotic.Wardaddy tries to school a new recruit through the horrors of war even though he himself has been lost into it and it's chaotic, feral machinations. He talks about the enemy, and being in enemy country, about how cruel the SS are, but not once does he point out that the war was started by one man's ideals.Like most wars, it's down to 1 man, who has some followers, and he makes it all happen. Time and again throughout history citizens and subjects must fight and die for the ideals of one, usually wealthy, person.Capitalism thrives on war, it always has. And again it is only select individuals who make billions from it. Even though they never pick up a gun nor fight a man face to face.Fury is only a great film because it fits the trope that almost all of us were brought up believing: war is brutal, but heroic and glorious. Oh, and we're always fighting for freedom even though our freedoms are becoming more eroded every single day.Fury doesn't bring all that into play though they want you to see soldiers as heroes, war as fighting for freedom, dying as helping the cause. But why not get 1 president into the ring along with another president and let them fight it out? It's their problem, not everyone else's.There are numerous military goofs in this film, far too many to point out and useless to do so also. One of the biggest goofs though is presenting this war as the heroic democracies fighting against the evil nazis. Private companies made hundreds of billions of dollars from the war, as they always do. And in truth the German people were mostly normal people just like Americans. It's time these films showed that, and that war is futile, and only ever serves the wealthy.","

"DanLives1980","4 June 2015","So I bought Fury on DVD to catch up on my David Ayer leading up to Suicide Squad. I'm in two minds about him so far. The jury may still be out because of his box office gambling habits. In essence I'd describe him as a visually effective renaissance director with a habit of cutting corners! Luckily with Fury that mostly works in its favour, but comparing it to Saving Private Ryan because it's bleak and wintery was a bad sales pitch. If anything, Fury is the younger brother of Enemy at the Gates and its daddy Iron Cross, despite it not being based around Russia. It has that undeniable element of exploitation to it that I feel makes up for everything Inglorious Basterds wasn't.Fury's strength is in the overwhelming theme of seeking an end or seeking salvation where there is none to be found and it paints a picture of the parts of WWII that have been so rarely depicted. The Yanks are animals in this movie and they are aware of just how desperate the situation is getting to be.Enter Logan Lerman's army typist Norman Ellison who is jettisoned to the war effort during the occupation of Nazi Germany and is he in over his head or what?! You really need to see the non-stop gore to get the drift...The crew of Fury, the titular sherman tank, are way beyond the douchiest people you could ever know, because the war has destroyed their souls and they know in their hearts that the chances of making it home are impossible, so when the film focuses on the importance of Ellison learning how to keep his crew alive in the slimmest odds.Sent on a slew of what can only be described as suicide missions, Fury leads the battallion's only remaining tanks into battle only for them to start falling one by one and leading to an inevitable battle to the death against Tiger tanks and a full SS regiment.Visually Fury mostly hits the spot but then some action scenes seemed a little more than rushed and not in the name of an overall sharp editing style. It just cuts corners here and there like I expect and where some scenes build great suspense felt it had greater potential.In regards to character, the ensemble cast nails it... mostly! Half the time I couldn't penetrate the impossible accents they were putting on. Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal were especially difficult but still I got the basics.The action and violence are also pure exploitation but heaped on top of the rising tension as we realise the theme of the movie - one that is ultimately the fear of death and having to face up to the consequences of one's actions - the resulting product is a horror movie based in the Second World War and that suits me down to the ground.Or, you know; it's Jaws but with tanks instead of boats and SS Waffen instead of sharks!","

"george.schmidt","17 October 2014","FURY (2014) **1/2 Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Pena, Jon Bernthal, Jim Parrack, Brad William Henke, Kevin Vance, Jason Isaacs. Filmmaker Davy Ayer's foray into male bonding via WWII warfare hits all the right marks for a steadily paced but somewhat rote period piece about a tank squadron in 1945's battle-weary European front attempting to remain alive in spite of impossible odds to the no-end-in-sight battles yet to be fought. The characters are somewhat cardboard thin, cookie-cutter (i.e. noble ethnic, muscle-head jerk, religious peacenik and green around the gills rookie) yet the ensemble of talent - particularly a world-weary Pitt (starting to show some character in his handsome face) as the sergeant in command who can feel the unbearable gravity of their plight weighing them down in to only a matter of time. The ugly muck and mire, grime soaked bruised palette by Roman Vasyanov's cinematography and Andrew Menzies production design allows for the gritty verisimilitude amidst sprinkling of graphic red bloodshed and unspeakable violence.","

"zardoz-13","26 October 2014","War is undeniably hell in writer & director David Ayer's ""Fury,"" a grim but electrifying World War II saga about tanks. Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Peña, and Jon Bernthal are thoroughly repellent as the battle-scarred crew of a U.S. Army Sherman M4A3E8 tank that tangles with a monstrous German 131 Tiger tank. For the record, the 33-ton Sherman tank came armed with a 75mm gun, but this was no match for the ferocious 54-ton Tiger tank. German Tigers boasted not only an 88mm gun, but also bore 3.9 inches of armor. Incredibly, Sherman tank shells often bounced off Tigers. Nevertheless, Tigers couldn't match a Sherman's rate of fire. Moreover, Tigers were vulnerable to shots fired at their rear compartments, and they consumed far more fuel than the Shermans. Unlike the Sherman tanks that their colleagues cruise around in, Pitt commands a modified Firefly Sherman tank equipped with a more powerful, 17-pound, super-velocity, anti-tank gun. The rugged combat sequence between three Shermans and a lone Tiger marks the high point of this blistering blood, guts, and testosterone-laced actioneer. ""Fury"" takes place in 1945, after the Allies have crossed the Rhine River into Hitler's Fatherland. Although our heroes belong to the U.S. 2nd Armored division, Ayer provides few details about where the action is actually happening. This may frustrate some armchair World War II scholars who thrive on such minute details. Indeed, nobody drops the names of prominent generals on either side or mentions historic battles. All we know is that our heroes started killing Germans in North Africa, and they have been pursuing them across Northern Europe with a terrible vengeance. Essentially, ""Fury"" is a World War II variation on the mud and blood splattered, World War I classic ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" (1930) but told from the perspective of the newest member of a Sherman tank's crew. Typically, most World War II movies pass off Korean War era tanks for Shermans and Tigers, but all the ""Fury"" tanks are authentic. The producers borrowed the last remaining Tiger tank from the Bovington Tank Museum in Dorset, England. ""Fury"" opens with hard-bitten Sergeant Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt of ""Killing Them Softly"") leaping like a savage Apache warrior onto an unsuspecting Nazi SS Officer on a white horse riding through a battlefield and stabbing him to death. Collier's Mexican-American tank driver, Trini 'Gordo' Garcia (Michael Peña of ""End of Watch""), cranks up their Sherman tank nicknamed 'Fury,' and they trundle off to a nearby Allied supply camp. Collier isn't happy because one of the original members of his five-man crew died in combat. As it turns out, Collier lands the worst of all possible replacements, Private Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman of ""The Three Musketeers""), a green, wet-behind-the-ears, teenager with neither the appropriate training nor combat experience. Cherub-faced Norman is a clerk typist who can bang out 60 words-a-minute. He knows nothing about tanks and he has never shot anybody. Collier and his unsavory crew terrify and toughen-up poor Norman so he can handle the pressures of combat. Collier forces Norman to shoot an unarmed S.S. soldier in the back. Collier, it seems, hates the S.S. with a virulent passion. The SS constituted the most brutal component of the Third Reich. Murdering civilians and unarmed prisoners-of-war constituted their stock-in-trade. Anyway, a young, inexperienced lieutenant orders Collier and two Sherman tanks to follow him into combat. The officer doesn't last long. An S.S. trooper with an anti-tank missile turns the lieutenant's tank in an inferno, and the lieutenant shoots himself before the flames roast him. Collier receives new orders from Captain Waggoner (Jason Isaacs of ""Windtalkers"") to rescue G.I.s who have been cut off from their unit. No sooner have the Shermans embarked on their mission than Collier spots a Tiger. Our heroes find themselves in a life and death struggle to dodge the Tiger's screaming shells. Gradually, young Norman becomes as psychotic about killing the enemy as his companions. The real trial by combat occurs when the Fury strikes a German land mine and breaks down at a crossroads. Collier refuses to abandon the Fury, even after Norman spots about 300 SS troops marching their way, proudly warbling a Nazi song.Naturally, comparisons between Brad Pitt's Sergeant Collier in ""Fury"" and his Lieutenant Aldo Raine in Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" are inevitable. Personally, I deplored ""Inglourious Basterds,"" while at the same time I admired Tarantino's tongue-in-cheek spin on World War II heroics. Like his ridiculously redneck officer in Tarantino's tale, Pitt lives to exterminate Nazis. However, Pitt doesn't try to be funny in ""Fury,"" and he is more convincing, especially during his dour moments when he coerces Norman, the epitome of innocence, to have sex with a German civilian. Unfortunately, writer & director David Ayer doesn't sketch in a backstory to explain Collier's hatred of the enemy. Meantime, Collier's crew looks straight out of a World War II propaganda movie. Hollywood combat movies made during the 1940s emphasized America's melting pot demographics. Collier's driver is an Hispanic-American, while his shell loader, obnoxious Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal of ""The Walking Dead""), is a raging Cajun. The gunner of the bunch, Boyd 'Bible' Swan (Shia LaBeouf of ""Transformers"") is a scripture-spouting, religious fanatic. All of them harass, humiliate and humble Norman until he becomes as cruel as they are. Nevertheless, Ayers spares us of usual banter about the girls back home, mom's apple pies, and favorite baseball teams. The final set-piece at the crossroads looks like a World War II version of the Alamo with our heroes battling the Nazi horde as if they were Audie Murphy. These Nazi warriors are essentially anonymous villains who lack the intelligence to wield their anti-tank missiles with the same accuracy that they did earlier in the film. Despite its lethargic 135 minutes and its bleak but predictable script, ""Fury"" remains tenaciously gripping, perhaps even more so during its quiet moments than its explosive ones.","

"Rendanlovell","4 November 2014","Fury is a brutal take on a tank unit called fury. We join the crew just after one of their crew members had been killed. And just a few hours later a new recruit Norman, is sent to fill the position. Set near the end of world war 2 fury jumps right into things. It assumes the audience is paying attention and doesn't really ever stop to let you catch your breath. Now when you think of a world war 2 film starring brad pitt you probably think inglorious Bastards. And even after watching this film that won't change. Which is sad really, Because Brad was great as the unapologetic leader of fury. The entire cast great as well. I was really happy to see Shia Labeuf back at it and turned in a career best performance. But the focal point of the film is definitely Brad Pitt and Percy Jackson star Logan Lerman. Logan as Norman, is a young man that has never seen any action but by the end of the film he is just as hardened as the rest of his crew members. Jon Bernthal Is also a surprise getting some great development as the bully of Fury. But Shia and Micheal pena just don't have the development they should've had. This is really disappointing because they have moments near the end of the film were we should've cared about them and just didn't.Speaking of the end, I'm not going to spoil anything but the concluding action sequence is one of the best that movies have to offer. It is utterly intense and beautifully shot. These were really the only things that were consistently great here. The cinematography and action. Great sound design also boasts the action scenes to a new level. Listening to tank shells whistle by narrowly missing someone is a real treat. The brutality of the action was another great factor. Watching people being blown in half is not only gruesome but oddly satisfying. And it left craving the next tank fight only to be handed overly long scenes of talking that didn't help the film in anyway. Granted this is only a problem nearer to the end of the film but it's still hard to overlook. During an especially long break from action I actually started to think of how this review would go. That's how uneventful these scenes were. There was no character development and mostly nothing happened in most of these scenes. Overall Fury is well acted, beautifully shot, and offers impressive action sequences. Although Shia LaBeouf and Micheal Penas characters are depressingly underwritten and some of the breaks between action scenes are completely useless.","

"Andyssoohigh","5 November 2014","Well, I had high hopes for this movie. I had awaited it's release and enjoyed the build up... hearing that Shia Lebouff didn't wash for weeks in order to get into role; much to the annoyance of the other cast members... Though, in truth this movie didn't reveal a lot about what it was like living and fighting through the war. I understood nothing after watching the movie about how cramped or what it might be like to live, fight and die inside a tank. Instead it seemed like ""it's the best job ever"" - alcohol in the pantry and (seemingly) plenty of space...The movie did provide loud noises. Colourful explosions. Some gruesome and somewhat shocking deaths. Some love. Some hate. And about as many war movie clichés as could be fit into the running time. Seriously, the end of the film will have you thinking - This is definitely an American made movie. I would still rate it as a 'decent' war movie. Though, do not get your hopes up. There has been such a dry patch and nothing can come close to Saving Private Ryan or the characterisation of band of brothers series...This movie played all the stereotype characters and yes they did play well. But I wanted so much more from the film. I wanted to feel like I had learnt a bit of history or at least a bit of insight after the screening. Instead all I learnt was that American blockbusters still play the stereotypes, the clichés and SO much cheese at the end the movie ends up stinking. Enjoy for an easy war flick but don't expect too much.","

"thedukeofmovietown","31 October 2016","I saw FURY yesterday! For me, there are only 3 perfect war movies. Only 3 that really raised the hair on the back of my neck and made everything feel as real and terrifying as I think a real war situation would be. Those movies are Platoon, Saving Pvt. Ryan and Full Metal Jacket. After seeing Fury, I have to add one to the list. This movie tells the story of men who operate a Sherman tank code named Fury during the Allies final push into the heart of Nazi Germany. The crew is forced to take on a new crew member when their assistant driver is killed and they're saddled with an inexperienced typist as a replacement during the most dangerous push of their tour.There is so much about this film that I absolutely love that if I were to go into it, I'd be here for over an hour. The filming is spectacular and really has that genuine film look that only movies like Apocalypse Now and Platoon seem to have. The casting is PERFECT and includes Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena, Jon Bernthal of Walking Dead fame, Logan Lerman and Brad Pitt as the men of tank Fury and a bevy of other actors that truly look like men of war not Hollywood actors. The characters are all well defined, diverse and sympathetic and watching them you really get both a sense of camaraderie and strong dose of battle fatigue just watching the men run the tank and it's just so genuine that you almost feel as if you need a shower afterwards as you feel the grime and the filth of war all around you. The only thing I think is missing from this film is just a little bit more story to back up the EVERYTHING ELSE that this movie does beautifully. Ideals are peaceful, history is violent and Fury is a MUST SEE! Fury gets a 4.5...out of 5","

"stephendaxter","5 January 2015","Fury is yet another film that takes place during the events of WWII and follows a group of soldiers in a tank as they take on an onslaught of German soldiers in an intense and horrific take on this time in history. This film stands out well above many of the other WWII films out there because it tries to depict the horrors of WWII on a much smaller scale. Rather than dealing with large groups of soldiers moving forth and battling over weeks or even months, this movie seems more concentrated as it focuses on only a single group of soldiers over the course of a few days. This very clever take on WWII by David Ayer worked really well as you got to really know a lot about the characters and that got you to really care about them whether you love or hate them. The action sequences also were so intense that you just did not want them to end. He captured the tone of WWII and showed it through the scenery and also the attitudes of the characters, just from the way they act and talk you instantly get an idea of the terror they have experienced. And if it weren't for the performances of the main cast this movie would not have been anywhere near as good as it was. Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf, John Bernthal, Logan Lerman, and Michael Pena all equally shine as they provide killer performances as this bunch of soldiers who have to put everything on the line to protect each other and their people. Unfortunately for Brad i don't believe an Oscar nomination is coming his way mainly because as i mentioned everyone was so good in this movie that there was no really stand out role, a very well balanced field of talent. The one thing i wanted more from the film was to maybe see a little of how the war has affected and changed them before the events of this film, we do get some of that from a few characters but seeing a bit of that could have added a little more insight into the motives driving these characters. But in the end Fury is a fantastic film with as very gritty portrayal of WWII and incredibly intense action sequences. - 8.3","

"Red_Identity","29 November 2014","It's too easy to hate on this guy, simply because of the sh*t he says or does. What makes it harder is that he's incredibly talented. He was unbelievably good here. The whole cast was strong, but he just did so much to a higher extent. He has a scene near the end that basically encapsulates how powerful acting can be when it's delivered in such affecting, lived-in realism. Not a single ounce of superficiality. Definitely in my Supporting Actor line-up, possibly my win, and I so wish the film was a bigger awards player just so he could be in the conversation As for the film, way better than I expected. Like I said, great ensemble. The screenplay is pretty formulaic, not saying anything we haven't heard before, but still effective. Lerman is easily 2nd best in show and further cements me as a fan. Probably in my Top 5 for Lead Actor.","

"KineticSeoul","10 April 2015","In my opinion this was a pretty disappointing movie. Sure, if you want to watch some tank battles this might be for you. But overall there isn't anything that makes this movie stand out. The story is weak and that applies to the character development as well. When it comes to the plot there just wasn't anything gripping when it comes to the action sequences or anything that leaves an impact. Now we all know the Nazis were the bad guys during WW2, but they are just ridiculously stupid in this movie. It's like the American soldiers have all these tactical guerilla warfare skills and the Nazis fight like soldiers during the civil war. This movie would have worked if it was a video game and it might have even won some awards, but as a movie it just isn't that good. And speaking of movies the enemy soldiers like I said fight like Call of Duty enemies in campaign mode one easy. On a positive note though, the acting is good but it's still wasted. Since the character development is so weak and the transition just doesn't make much sense. Chances are your not really going to care about any of the soldiers that manuevers the tank Fury. I recently saw ""Furious 7"" and watching this movie was part ""Furious 7"" where a group goes on explosive mission after mission. Except when it comes to ""Furious 7"" it had other previous installments for character development. Part ""Inglorious Basterds"" when it comes to the interaction except not as good. And part ""Miracle at St. Anna"" because of the costant talk of spirituality. I think this movie would have worked if it tried to just be a balls to the wall action popcorn flick. But it tries to be something more and that is where it falters.6/10","

"dcarsonhagy","29 April 2015","I put off for a while watching this movie because IMO Brad Pitt has made many poor movie choices recently. Caught this on On-Demand last evening and was riveted from beginning to end.The story tells a tale about ""Wardaddy"" (Brad Pitt) and his merry band of fellow tank partners heading toward the front lines in WWII. His men are hardened soldiers who have seen just about everything that war has to offer. Pitt loses one of his original men and a replacement is sent to him--in the form of a clerk typist. ""Fury"" is probably the best war film I've seen since ""Saving Private Ryan."" It's gritty, graphic, well acted, and well directed. Brad Pritt is finally able to show his acting chops. He never overplays a scene here; he is constantly pulling back. The ability for him to do that makes his portrayal of ""Wardaddy"" that much more believable. There is one scene that was almost too uncomfortable for me to watch. What appears to be a peaceful moment you know could erupt into horrible violence at a moments notice. This film was also educational for me. I found out that in the beginning of WWII our tanks were vastly inferior to German tanks, which were referred to as Tigers. Its only weak spot was located in the rear, so I can only imagine how difficult it must have been to get in position and try to attack those.The movie is rated ""R,"" and deservingly so. It contains constant language and graphic war-time violence. If you haven't seen this one already, you owe it to yourself to check it out.","

"un1","2 December 2014","A solid, realistic, first half of the movie, with good action and dialogue, but I feel the 2nd half is too unrealistic, and again we have the typical American portrayal of German soldiers as being stupid(and the belief that somehow German women are all prostitutes willing to sleep with Americans). The only character that I didn't like was Brad Pitt's character, as in other movies he is some maniac ""killing gnazis"" and being that fanatical about it that he sacrifices almost his entire crew and himself towards that goal, although they could have easily live to fight another day. My favorite character was Shia LaBeouf's character, he seemed the most believable of all(a loyal friend, a fighter and a Christian).","

"morrison-dylan-fan","4 March 2015","Walking back home a few days ago,I decided to take a look in a second hand DVD shop,and I was surprised to find that they were selling a rather recent DVD release at a very cheap price,that I could trade in to another shop,and get double the money back!,which led to me getting ready to jump in the tank.The plot-Nazi Germany 1945:After Hitler declares that every man,women & child must join the war so that the Nazis can win,The Allies decide to push into Germany,in the hope that the war is reaching its final stages.As they attempt to enter into Germany,the crew of a M4A3E8 Sherman tank suffer the loss of a servicemen.Meeting up with fellow soldiers, US Army S/Sgt. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier is told that the only replacement soldier available for him is a man called Norman ""Machine"" Ellison,who has been an army typist,who has never set foot on the battle ground.Finding Ellison to be a weakling,Collier & his men take Ellison on reluctantly.With having never seen a war zone before,Ellison holds the heroic tales which he has heard as something similar to what he will experience,only to discover that the fury on the battlefield is merciless.View on the film:Going from the cops vs gangsters war on the streets,to the war on the battlefield,writer/director David Ayer & cinematographer Roman Vasyanov drain their extremely loose take on Staff Sergeant Lafayette G. Pool fight against the Nazis of any primary colours,with Ayer and Vasyanov rubbing dirt into the movie,as the tank (which was not a prop,but actually the last known surviving version of a Tiger I) crushes the mountains of broken bodies & gunfire in its way.Locking the Tiger I down for the final 30 minutes,Ayer and Vasyanov cast a rusty mist across the title to create a ghostly atmosphere,as the Nazis stomp out of the shadows.Aiming for a ""realistic"" feel by having the characters speak in a harsh,brittle dialogue,the screenplay by Ayer completely misses its target,and fails to explode.Failing to give even the barest outline as to what locations the tank finds itself in,Ayer makes ""Wardaddy"" and his crew flat,cardboard cut outs,who are each shown to be extremely vicious bullies,who experience a sudden change of heart towards Ellison,despite Ellison not having done anything to make ""Wardaddy's"" gang of jerks display such a sudden difference of option towards him.Appearing this time without a paper bag on his head, Shia LaBeouf gives a good,rough performance as the worn-down Boyd 'Bible' Swan,whilst Brad Pitt does well at barking orders as the stiff- drinking Don 'Wardaddy' Collier,in a film which fails to strike down with furious anger.","

"nzpedals","13 September 2016","No amount of reading war history or personal accounts can match the way ""Fury"" displays so many realities of war experience. Whilst some other reviewers complain about clichés, I recognise that clichés or not, this is reality. There is the bulldozer pushing dead bodies, the tank crushing a corpse, the clerk cleaning the inside of the tank after a death, the older crew and their relationships, summary executions, decisions of strategy by the commander, fear, confusion, civilian casualties... and so many more.Brad Pitt's performance is so much better than in (for example) Inglourious Basterds, here, he captures the very essence of his role and seems to almost enjoy doing it. A feature of the DVD shows Pitt looking about 10 years younger than in the movie - does that show just what the make-up people can do? (with hair cement?)Logan Lerman as the typist-clerk suddenly sent to be assistant driver in Pitt's tank is just as important to the feel of the movie as Pitt. Well done.The basic story is easy to follow, a tank and its crew involved in the battles across Germany near the end of the war, the characters are well defined, the acting is flawless, and there are several especially good scenes with memorable dialogue, so I've given it a 9. OK, so the final scenes are not really believable, (is that an LED torch we see?) but by then I've decided on the rating to give it!The section where they meet up with two beautiful young women is so similar to what happens in the totally different movie ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", perhaps the writer knew that? Anyway, it was worth putting in.","

"neil-476","25 October 2014","Fury is a tank operated by Sgt Brad Pitt and his crew in Germany in the closing days of World War II, against increasingly desperate German forces. This film tells of events from the arrival of inexperienced replacement Norman (Logan Lerman) to a battle to hold back forces at a strategic crossroads.If I had a criticism, it would be that there was no sense of an overriding narrative purpose to tie together the episodes which the Fury crew go through. In particular, there is a lengthy sequence in an apartment with two German girls which seems to have little to do with what comes before or after and, in showing strange and unpredictable behaviour from all the crew members, doesn't provide too much clarification on the effects of war on them, either. It is a good sequence, but it leaves you uncertain as to what it was intended to achieve.But, for the most part, this is a very good film. It conveys the brutality and violence of war in the visceral Saving Private Ryan fashion, and you get a strong sense of what it must have been like to have been there. It is brilliantly staged, and the performances are mostly very good (although I thought Logan Lerman, despite having some very good moments, mostly had his face stuck in one unchanging expression).","

"Likes_Ninjas90","22 October 2014","Set in the final year of the Second World War, Fury is the story of how a young man enters combat and becomes a killing machine. How the film and its director David Ayer feel about the premise is ideologically confused and contradictory. On one hand the film is a brutal representation of the final tank battles of the war and how merciless the Allies were to Germans and their prisoners as a way of saving their own hides. Yet the film's fascist politics are exemplified by showing how young men become accepted into the brainless, macho brotherhood of their peers once they are capable of murdering enemies without hesitation. Some will dismiss the film as a silly boy's club adventure, but this does little to dispel the unsavouriness. Fury's timing is as misjudged as it is deliberate. In an era of contemporary global warfare, it's a film disturbingly unconcerned by psychology or battle scars but celebrating how many kills a single tank crew can score for their country. Fury doesn't have a plot but is a road trip, compromised of a series of battles and the occasional pit stop for male bonding. Brad Pitt stars as Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier"" the leader of a five man Sherman tank vehicle named ""Fury"". Wardaddy believes in the kill or be killed rules of war. In a troubling early scene, he physically forces Norman (Logan Lerman) to shoot a captured German soldier in the back with a revolver. Norman is the young rookie who is our only emotional entry point into the crew. He has only been in the war for eight weeks as a typist and has not see combat before being inserted into the crew. He cries and says he would rather die himself than to shoot a prisoner. The early scenes allow Logan Lerman's performance to standout by emoting Norman's fear and passivity. However, the character's inexperience is highly contrived, predictably segueing him from a rookie and into a raging machine gunner, mowing down Germans as he screams at them.The other characters in Ayer's own original script are lazy stereotypes. Shia LaBeouf is Boyd ""Bible"" Swan who, would you know it, quotes passages from the Bible. Michael Pena from Ayer's last film End of Watch, which was about the friendship between two police officers, features as Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia but his role makes little use of his charisma. The most unlikable part is reserved for Jon Bernthal as Grady, a knuckle-dragging brute, who might have been too unpleasant for the Dirty Dozen. There is almost no backstory, aside from the original tank crew being together since Africa and their dialogue is primarily inane, blokey conversations, compromised of homophobic slurs and primitive views of women. Some of this material is inaudible due to the slurred, mumbling line deliveries. One unexpected detour in the film is a long sequence where Wardaddy takes Norman aside and into a home with two German women. As Wardaddy takes off his equipment, we fear the worst. But the scene shows an unexpected side to his character. He encourages Norman and the two women to share a meal together. The other members of the tank crew enter, behaving like barbarians. They complain they weren't invited and upset the youngest women by making her cry, until Wardaddy pulls them into line. It's a strange scene for a number of reasons: it's one of the few moments of mercy and while we appreciate seeing a new side to Wardaddy it makes little sense how someone so dogmatic about serving the company would risk dividing his team by helping Norman. Maybe war makes people act in funny ways or Wardaddy has spent too long in the tank. While his script is disappointing, Ayer hasn't wasted the eighty million dollar budget. The production values, including the filthy, grimy look and diluted grey tones, are of a high standard. The scenes are very well populated with plenty of extras including wounded soldiers, prisoners and other tanks, which are important details because it means Fury's crew isn't the only tank group fighting in the war. But the realism is undermined in the last battle where Fury alone must withstand a huge swarm of Nazi troops, too stupid to immediately use anti-tank weapons. The corn in this sequence, compromised of bromancing and personal sacrifice, is a lame retread of war movie conventions and lacks further power since it's difficult to care for these generic characters. The battle itself, with an implausible body count, will appeal to Michael Bay enthusiasts and teenagers who think video games like Call of Duty resemble real world politics.The film's ending further typifies the film's indecisive political viewpoint. A moment of compassion between two soldiers is immediately undone by a final high angle shot, which shows a single tank and the masses of bodies it has laid waste upon. War films aren't an untouchable genre today but when the budget and the talent are this big a filmmaker should sustain a clear ideological viewpoint. At a time when real war affects so many people's lives, wouldn't a genuine act of courage today be if a Hollywood director could be forthright about how they feel about warfare and give the audience something to dwell over once the movie has emptied its barrels?","

It showed how risky the job could be and also how brutal it was. Fury was based on multiple stories that took place in WWll. One of the stories that inspired the movie of 'Fury' was that of Sergeant Lafayette ""Wardaddy"" G. Pool. His tank was named ""In the Mood."" Pool and his crew ""would kill 12 tanks, 258 armored vehicles and self-propelled guns, and 1,000 German soldiers in only 79 days,"" according to.","

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","28 November 2014","April, 1945. The war is ending. Deep in enemy territory, our five protagonists command a tank, including a rookie who has to be quickly broken early on, because it's the only way he can be of any use to them. A Sherman, widely regarded as the weakest type for the time, extremely vulnerable not only to enemy equivalents, but also infantry-held Panzerfaust. This bears similarities to Das Boot – narrow focus on the claustrophobic, heavy death-trap, with us trapped in an oppressive atmosphere, seeing the ugliness and the filth. We don't get a plot, in spite of a series of events presented in chronological order, we're seeing men carrying out their duty, and we, like they, get to know this small group, with the macho culture, black comedy and tight bond they form in this awful situation. And if we didn't have that, this would be unwatchable – it's simply too nasty.David Ayer directs his first period piece here, bringing his inside understanding of L.A. gangs, especially the interpersonal relationships and fatalism, his unflinching determination to show every miserable aspect, to this, and makes it look effortless. I hope this is the first of many times he plays around with his honed formula – End of Watch gave us a POV take on it, and this shares its intensity and immersiveness. Every second of this, you can smell the filth. There are occasional brief glimpses of something outside of the soul-crushing reality of their daily life. These never truly feel like anything other than escapist fantasy, and soon enough, we, and they, wake up. The action scenes aren't entertaining, they are just the release of the anxious undercurrent. You feel awful for the relief when a German dies, in spite of it being an actual ""us or them"", of hesitation meaning one's own death. The ending does lose us.There is constant violent, bloody, gory and disturbing content and strong language, as well as some hinted at sexuality in this. I recommend this to anyone who genuinely thinks they can tolerate it... it will make you think twice about war. 9/10","

"iNickR","8 February 2018","Fury follows a bad-ass tank crew and its bad-ass, grizzled, Nazi-hating, SS-killing leader, Sgt. Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt). A new kid, Norman (Logan Lerman), joins the team - pretty much against his better judgement. He's never seen the inside of a tank before and hasn't even fired a gun since basic training. He's quite certain there's been a mistake and just wants to go home.Norman is a military-trained typist. An excellent, experienced typist; 60-words a minute he can go. A worthwhile skill to have when you've got a superior officer dictating a memo, but does it work when you've got an entire division of Nazis shooting at you? Not exactly. Norman is teased relentlessly, and mercilessly slapped around by Wardaddy because he refuses to kill anyone. Norman's crewmates believe he'll get them all killed one day, and there's plenty of opportunity for that. Wardaddy is well respected by the Oldman (Jason Isaacs, whom you won't even recognize) and it's Wardaddy's crew that always get the call when there are Nazi's that need killing or Allies that need rescuing; a task that Wardaddy ruthlessly, and violently, carries out with gusto and a 'take no prisoners' attitude.Fury shows the horrors of war quite explicitly. There is enough blood and gore in this movie to make any horror film make-up artist blush. I'm confident in saying that the actions displayed on screen in Fury happened in real life during the war - during any war - even though this particular story is fiction. It's that realism that makes this film sometimes hard to watch. 'War is hell' to quote William Tecumseh Sherman. Everything is so realistic and so genuine it's nauseating.I began to hate Brad Pitt as this movie went on. He plays quite a jerk. You'll hate him too (if you don't already for some other reason). Same with Jon Bernthal (that's the guy who played Shane in The Walking Dead). He's a creepy war machine without a conscience. Shia LaBeouf plays a depressed bible-quoting, war-weary soldier, and you know something else, he's really good in this role! I was surprised, actually, because of, you know, his frequent meltdowns I figured he just went crazy and stopped acting. His character is a troubled and emotional young man, so it's not too far from reality (and the cut on his right cheek is real and self-inflicted prior to filming the movie). Logan Lerman is awesome. He's come a long way since The Butterfly Effect (2004), and I much prefer to see him in an intense role like this, surrounded by so much talent. Lerman feeds off the other actors and you can see it.Sound mix is awesome, so is the cinematography (same guy who shot Suicide Squad and End of Watch). There is a good scene when some tanks get into a battle with some stubborn Nazis. There is one shot in particular that is awe-inspiring. You'll know which one I'm talking about when you see it. It's quite stunning. I don't use the term 'awe-inspiring' very often.Overall, good movie, watch it when you can.","

"wellthatswhatithinkanyway","28 July 2015","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In 1945, as the Second World War draws to a close, Hitler has ordered a final, all out assault from every member of the Aryan race to ensure a clearly unattainable victory. In this culminating desperation, Tank commander Captain Collier (Brad Pitt) leads his squadron of men, only now they have a new recruit, in the shape of Private Ellison (Logan Lerman), who's got a whole lot of learning to do in the brutal realities of war.The Nazi Supermen may not have lasted for a thousand years, as Hitler wanted, but yarns from the battlefields of World War 2 could quite conceivably do so, and Fury is the latest in a long line of such stories. David Ayer's addition to the genre thrusts us in to that period towards the end, when desperation to secure victory was pumping from both the sides of good and evil, more so evil, and as such their panic was leading to ever more extreme and twisted methods to win. As such, like the best war films, Fury does not shy away from showing the brutal, horrific reality of life in battle, unflinching in both blood-letting and human drama. Sadly, Ayer just bumbles the whole thing around, without any solid narrative or structure to hold it together.The humorous touch from more recent films like The Monuments Men and Inglorious Basterds is not present, and the film is aiming to come off in the league of such fare as Saving Private Ryan and the lesser heard of, but raved about A Midnight Clear. But while those films did a marvellous job of bringing real characters to life, with deft, subtle touches that exposed their human frailties in the most real way, Fury's characters can't help but project the stereotypical blandness of your average war film. Pitt is an effective leading man, and he does his best here, but he doesn't quite have the charisma to really make it great. Likewise, the supporting cast are also unable to rise to their best.It's a shame, as with tighter writing and a more structured plot, Fury could have risen from the good to great category. I didn't think it was quite as bad as a lot of other people seem to, but that's not to say I can't see the missed potential. ***","

"kghispredi","17 February 2015","A band of soldiers battle hardened in Africa now find themselves in Europe. They are joined by an inexperienced and naive soldier used to administrative tasks. He tries to be friendly but his new unit treats him roughly. They are scoundrels but they respect the commanding officer. Their difficult mission will see graphic, realistic violence, moral dilemmas (treating a captured enemy soldier) and tough choices. Do what's right or what will keep you alive? They choose the latter but their commander will persuade them to do what's right.They will die, one by one (except for the rookie), and the commander will be the last to die, fighting enemy even when mortally wounded. Despite that, their mission will be successful.OK, what movie was that? That was a trick question: both! Saving Private Ryan and Fury share so many elements that it borders with plagiarism. Is it a good movie? Up to a point. Acting is good and so are special effects, but military buffs will be quick to point out that the supposedly realistic portrayal of war is full of absurd situations. The worst of them is Rambo-style battle in the end in which elite soldiers perish in droves while running with rifles around an immobile tank.Not a great war movie but definitely better than American Sniper!","

"hawkroad","1 December 2014","This isn't so much a review as it is an answer to the many war aficionados that took the time to write negative reviews, most making a point of bragging they know the German word for 'Bazooka'. 'Fury'is a must-see for this lazy, advantage-laden generation that for over half a century haven't given a second thought to being REQUIRED to go to war. Real war...no drones, very little air support at all, actually...where gruesomeness and the very worst of humanity must surface for the greater good.I was born exactly 30 years after this war ended, but, Hollywood antics aside, see the dark side that so many had to face in this movie. You dimwits that are picking this movie apart because of plausibility improbabilities need to put down your Guns & Ammo magazines, move out of your Mom's basement bedroom, and grow even a grape-sized pair before picking apart this film. Excellent cinematography, excellent acting, and EXCELLENT Clichés. Lest we forget, dimwits. I saw through the Hollywood, sure...but I saw the horror and absolute destruction of the people's very souls unfold before my eyes, and that's what we need to see. NEED to see.Good job, Brad..bye the way. Shia, Jon and Logan, too. I've watched so many crappy movies lately that I find it hard to believe someone would give this two stars because the SS had so many 'Panzerfuasts'(Bazookas, for all us meat-head non-Guns & Ammo subscribers) and couldn't hit the tank. Bravo, I say. I wouldn't want to leave my crappy paying job to do it, that's for sure!","

"jhoeboer-1","23 October 2015","So based on the IMDb score I had fairly high hopes for this film, in addition to the fact it has some very nice actors in there who have proved their mettle. I was expecting a 7,5-8,0 and what I got felt more like 6,0 out of 10.Warning, spoiler alerts!This film has some terribly poor shot scenes that show off Hollywood's preference to ""action"" and ""drama"" rather than toning it down a bit and thus creating some actual suspense (Check out Das Boot for example if you want to see how it should have been done in terms of building suspense and character development).I was literally laughing at my TV when the scene came along where Brad Pitt's brigade has to attack At cannons through an open field:1. Why not flank them? Well, because Shermans were so well known for their fantastic frontal armour so those shots will bounce right off for right? And sure we have no intel on what they have for weaponry or numbers but I'm sure their calibre and skill of the crew will be so feeble that they will LITERALLY miss 3-4 shots fired straight at a bunch of Sherman tanks actually moving at walking speed. Because obviously German AT crews firing AP shells from cover would surely miss multiple times at a distance of a only a few 100 yards with a precision engineered high powered antitank cannon. That's way beyond suspending of disbelief here.2. The scene that really killed the film for me is the part where they get into a house with the 2 German women and they have a dinner. That part was actually nice, where Brad Pitt's character actually tries to get a bit of the normal world back among the madness of war. But the following scene just shouts Hollywood's misunderstanding of what drama is all over it. Way before the mortar barrage starts I was already telling myself 'If I was a really BAD scriptwriter I'd have an enemy counter attack hitting the village right when they come out and of course a stray shell utterly destroys the building they were just in killing the women they had just sort of bonded with.' And so it happened.Clever scriptwriting and dramatic impact? No, Hollywood ""geniuses"", that's just called playing the 'Lazy Captain Obvious' card.The film had potential but stuff such as described above just killed it, well that and all the usual clichés:Rookie joining an experienced crew - Rookie gets pushed around a lot - Rookie eventually somehow proves himself - The guys on the Fury tank are mostly just the standard stereotypes (preachy kind of guy, redneck hillbilly) and we're supposed to accept what they do and care about them because they've been through rough times. The only 2 interesting characters are Brad Pitt and the rookie, the rest is utterly forgettable/interchangeable. - The German soldiers are all either nameless thugs (Well safe for 1 scene) or just purely evil and can be shot without something like a trial even though they're unarmed and have surrendered (Private Ryan did so much better a job about what war does to people and how soldiers try to preserve their humanity (think about the final scene of that film).Such a letdown.","

"jjlawler-98324","2 February 2024","In WWII American manufacturing was simply better than German. Sherman tanks often win the day as Anything Gernany produced was garbage by 1945. Fury is a gritty movie showing the brutality as close as any movie has shown before. American tank crews worked as teams to overcome a violent enemy. Like in the actual war, the Americans out smart out tough the German soldiers. No surprise. Americans are simply more dominant. Germany had no chance. In the movie the American team led by Brad Pitt's character survives on knowledge and a willingness to die. The genius of strategy shied the American fighting man in the right light. War is hell.","

"MLDinTN","15 June 2015","survives together or not. In this movie, a newcomer, Norman, joins a tank crew during the war in Germany. He's only trained to be a typist, so what he sees upon joining the tank really blows his mind. Brad Pitt plays Wardaddy, the boss. Boyd is the religious one, Gordo the cool one, and Grady the crazy one. At first, Norman doesn't want to shoot and is taught a humiliating lesson by Wardaddy about shooting Krauts. I thought that went against character and made Wardaddy not likable. Soon they are fighting and survive a close call, and then take over a town. While there an extended scene is thrown in where Wardaddy and Norman take up in a residence with 2 girls. It seems Wardaddy just wants them to make something to eat, but it is so weird and then wants Norman to take one girl into the bedroom. Then his other 3 crew show up and are so rude, but Wardaddy doesn't throw them out. Why not? Then the tank crew is given a mission to hold crossroads and they have to do it by themselves. The tank breaks but they hold on when a Nazi caravan show up. Only Norman survives. What I didn't get was they throw some grenades inside, and later when Norman climbs back into the tank, Wardaddy is still intact. Wouldn't he have been blown to pieces? Anyway, at the end we see they had killed a large number of the Nazis and American troops had showed up.I thought the gore and war violence was pretty good. It was more realistic and not for shock value.FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was an OK war film. Worth checking out if you like these type of films.","

"supatube","2 April 2015","Five months before WWII comes to an end, in the heart of Nazi Germany, five militants become increasingly agitated at the prospect of being defeated by a soulless movement. Rookie soldier Norman (Logan Lerman) is thrust into the middle of unapologetic battle with war-hardened sergeant, Wardaddy (Brad Pitt), whom is tasked with getting Norman up to scratch with the other soldiers in the tank, imaginatively named Fury.Every scene seems flooded with mixed emotions fuelled by overacting that doesn't really add up together to form a proper sum. Not to say that the acting was terrible, rather misdirected from shot to shot. The emotion does not read the same in one singular scene. And at times is a complete left field emotion, thrown in to much confusion. Why does Shia LaBeouf look like he is about to cry? Why is he now crying? Why does he look mad, and about to cry?Another jarring aspect is the use of slang, which is not WWII language circa 1945, more like hip- hop video circa 2010. It's slight, but not at all guised. Lets run through the many cliché's ever so quickly: Savage horseback murder, Christian Hymns, hardened leader with a rookie whom should not be at the front line, fleeting love story with deadly end, the verbal moment all the soldiers decide to stick together, they all die (and not at once as each one needs their moment to perish) except one (doubt it's the rookieright?) and the enemy wins - the battle - because we all really know that the enemy lost the war.Its not an epic war drama that offers anything new, informative or unsurprising to a tale that's been told with variable angles, covering a large part of all types of emotions that were felt by anyone who was effected by WWII. The story could have worked in any war setting, even a made up world caught in conflict, as the film did very little to dig into a topic that's been covered thoroughly in a school subject called History. We know it. We want more.Then the film felt more of an American puff piece about how heroic they are, which is probably why WWII was used as it was probably the last time Americans were seen as a hero in war. Lets remove history from the story then what we have is a very watchable action film.","

"sickofenjoyingmyself","15 July 2015","For some reason I really didn't think I was going to like this movie - having seen so many great and memorable world war movies I was a little bit expectant of slightly re-hashed material that was too much Hollywood and too little in substance and storyline. Thankfully I was proved to be completely wrong. Fury shows us a World War movie from a new angle I certainly hadn't seen before - from life inside a tank. This was something fascinating and thought provoking - imagine having to live inside such a confined moving target with a group of other men? The performances were slightly understated and I think the movie was all the richer for it. Shia Leboeuf held his role very professionally and very believably and Brad Pitt was excellent his portrayal gave a lot of depth that I wasn't expecting (the trailer almost hinted to me of his character having a very shouty, over exaggerated performance). Like any great war movie it has some memorable scenes - in this from the moment they walk into the German lady's house until the moment it is is bombed not long after is completely surreal - which must have reflected the surrealism of a lot of moments that happened during the great wars.The dinner table scene was taut with unpredictability. All around there are some great performances, memorable scenes and a realistically brooding atmosphere. A very enjoyable movie that I would watch again. Still does not quite sit up there with the very best war movies I have seen - but one of the most solid candidates in recent years.","

"Varakreivi","9 March 2016","This movie has got so many negative reviews I had to write my own opinion. I've seen quite a many war films, and for me this was top-ten material.Many of the negative reviews here completely miss the point of this film. It's not a documentary of WWII US Army combined arms tactics. It's a movie about five guys inside a tank, and in my opinion it does that job really well. In that sense, this movie could as well happen in any theatre of war, or in any war. The tankers could as well be Germans, or Soviet, or Japanese. The movie could be set in Afghanistan and it wouldn't change the fundamental idea.What I think this movie is about is the effect of war on man. We see rugged and stressed soldiers trying to get to the end of the day, just to start it over the next day. We see men who are extremely bonded together, yet way too used to see their mates die. There are no good or bad guys in this movie. One moment they are ruthless and crazy, even evil, and the next they are loyal and understanding. They hate and love each other at the same time. I'd imagine this could happen after years of constant war. And this is just what the movie excels at - the acting and the dynamics of the cast is very good an plausible. It's a true piece of art of method acting.Of course there are the usual movie dynamics - there's a beginning, a middle part and an ending, for example - which some reviewers seem to take as game-breaking clichés, but I felt the movie was very self-aware of this and tried to take a fresh angle. Yes, the movie has it's clichés, but I thought them as not bad writing, but more like a commentary on war movies. Mostly it's the characters, who are quite familiar archetypes, and the whole point seems to take these types and put them in a different perspective, it being the battle fatigue and it's effect on the men and the bond between them.I said the story would work as well in any war, but regardless of that the attention to details in the movie is astonishing. I think in this category the movie surpasses every preceding WWII movie. The equipment doesn't just be periodically accurate, but the field modifications and looted gear seem to be just right. One reviewer was upset that one of the war trophy medals that we can see in the background a few times had a ribbon, when the medals were actually worn without. That is the historical inaccuracy this (apparently quite competent in WWII props) reviewer found from the movie. I think it says quite a lot of the details.Most of the critic concern on the battle scenes. Some of it is sound, but a lot of it is not very accurate. Reviewers are upset because German cannons didn't hit on the first shot, or because they made poor tactical choices. Many are enraged because the US soldiers execute a POW. Seems like for some people, ""realism"" equals ""Wehrmacht Tactical Manual"" or ""Geneva convention"", and obviously this movie is not at all about them. It's about war-worn, desperate and very, very tired people who try to stay alive. One must understand these are the final weeks of the war, and the German army is only a shadow of its former might. The remaining soldiers consist of children, retirees and a few tired veterans who very well know they have no chance. The Waffen-SS had long since abandoned it's recruitment criteria, consisting at this point of nothing more than standard Wehrmacht units (besides, it's status as an elite force altogether can be debated). Excluding the over-the-top final fight, I think the battle scenes are plausible, although presented in an action-packed format. There are lots of lucky hits and misses that bend the credibility, but nothing that truly breaks it. And in the end, the survival in real war was/is quite considerably a matter of luck.Many have compared this movie to Saving Private Ryan. I think it's a totally different viewpoint. Ryan was a homage to the veterans (which they undoubtedly deserve), with all it's waving flags and lovable characters. It showed the scenery, battles and events, but with all the dramatic scenes and cheesy soundtrack the psychology of the characters, the effects of war on them, was left unturned. Fury, on the other hand, is a movie just about that, the stress and psychology of war. And in that front it works extremely well.It is possible that the war was not always this grim, but in its worst it most definitely was.","

"TxMike","25 May 2015","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. While there have been many movies set in World War 2 this one is unique in that it features the crew of one Sherman Tank, which they called 'FURY' and it was painted in white letters on the barrel of the 75 mm main gun.The movie has a number of excellent big-name actors, featuring Brad Pitt as Don 'Wardaddy' Collier. His character is not too far removed from his Lt. Aldo Raine character in 'Inglorious Basterds'. Here he is Commander of FURY and he has to balance order and discipline with letting the crew cut loose when the situation allows.It is set beginning in April 1945, near the end of the war. Troops are pushing into Nazi Germany for what we know is the eventual outcome and tanks are playing a key role in that advance. After taking yet another village and killing all the Nazi soldiers the men find a few young ladies and enjoy newfound female relationships before the crew is called for another key mission. To protect a crossroads. The final scenes are the battle at those crossroads. It is very intense and realistic. Not all survive but the effort of the Allies is successful.War is not fun or easy and should never be glamorized. In an effort to make this movie realistic the filmmakers and actors spent some time with actual tank crew veterans of WW2, most of them in their 90s, telling things they probably never even told their families. Not a fun movie to watch but a good movie to remind us how hard we should work to avoid another world war.","

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","12 January 2015","War films aren't the easiest to depict for a number of reasons. Depending on the era the war took place; the period had certain items. These items range from weapons, tools, clothing and vehicles. Not every item from every era exists nowadays. Even if they are still in mint condition, that does not mean it will be available for use. This kind of permission only happens when the people making the film really know what they are doing and have the respect to take care of it and use it in a way that not only shows it in its prime but glorifies it when it's over. The production behind this movie did exactly that The story follows Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Brad Pitt) and his small crew that end up accepting a reassigned typist turned rookie soldier (Logan Lerman). Together, they face incredible odds to break what's left of Hitler's Nazis.As a war drama, this film has it. Writer/director David Ayer displays that he worked hard for what he puts up on screen. The realism is definitely illusive, with lots of blood, explosions and ugly ways to die. It'll make audiences wonder how does one accept such a horrific fate or if they survived, how does one cope with what they saw. The best sequences however do not belong to the gun shootouts in the field or urban terrain. The notable scenes belong to the Sherman tanks. Visually watching these behemoths literally punch holes in anything they launch their projectiles into is enticing to see. This also goes with the mechanics behind how trained soldiers operate and direct these monsters. The operations also do not always take place from the inside, to give a better idea of what the tanks try to accomplish, cinematographer Roman Vasyanov also shoots from a bird's eye view. It's a different angle and it works in helping the audience understand. Vasyanov also gets other good shots of the urban and rural terrain, either by infantry POV or just showing the devastation. The sound quality is also praiseworthy; much of it sounds like what you would hear from the old Call of Duty games.The acting is also very good along with most of each one's development as an individual. Although this isn't Brad Pitt's first war film, he continues to show that he can immerse himself in the role that he plays. Here, Pitt portrays his character as a softy but only when it comes to his men and Fury; everyone else he could care less. Surprisingly as much as he continues to trash his reputation, Shia LaBeouf demonstrates that he can act too and not like the punk character of Sam Witwicky from Michael Bay's Transformers (2007) sequels. For once, LaBeouf is a man and that deserves a thumb's up. Logan Lerman's performance is a great representation of the relatable character for the audience. This is due to his combat experience and how he sees warfare. As time progresses, audiences will understand why his view on war changes. Michael Peña as ""Gordo"" the only soldier in the crew to give a little foreign flavor provides much of the dry humor (it is done appropriately) that is easily understandable for the situations the crew gets into. Finally is Jon Bernthal who plays a somewhat uneducated soldier but even with his lack of respect for certain things, he also exhibits some likable humanity from time to time.The only real blunders this movie makes, belongs to its writing. The characters are developed accordingly but backgrounds are left out entirely except for a few tidbits. Aside from Lerman's character, nobody has any kind of back story other than the crew used to have more tanks and first met in Africa. Okay that's when they met, but what about family at home? This would not only flesh out each individual but also give them a more human persona than just military guys who have nothing but their comrades. Then again, that may be the case but it's never stated clearly. Also, how is that Wardaddy knows fluent German? And why couldn't subtitles be put for those moments when German was spoken? It's not like they were the most pivotal points in the film but it would've been nice to know what was being said.Besides these two components, the only other part that felt sluggish and extended for too long was a dining room table scene. Here, Wardaddy and Lerman's character take some time to settle down in a German woman's house. There they have them make a meal and sit down to eat. At that moment, the rest of the crew comes up and sits down with them. This scene drags, and in some ways feels intentional while also being unintentional. My guess is that the intentional was supposed to emphasize the importance of enjoying the moments of rest soldiers had. However, the unintentional may be that it went on for too long of ""enjoying the moment"" and forgetting where the time went. I guess the editors (who have worked for other well respected movies) forgot to trim this scene. On the other hand, the music composed by Steven Price was a new listening experience. Price included choirs that highlighted the doom and gloom of the Nazis and the horrors of war for the Allied troops. When it came to the tank scenes, the instruments kept the scene very tense by using deep brass and percussion. Considering he's only scored a few films, score collectors should keep an ear out for his next entry.Writer/director David Ayer's story omits character back-stories and has one scene that drags but everything else works wonderfully. The acting is solid by all actors, the music matches the period's tone and the tank warfare is highly engaging.","

Public knowledge of world war two proliferated as America's economy and educated bourgeois grew rapidly. Stories of soldiers were scarcely made public in lieu of patriotic or nationalistic gain, so humanized scripts for this depiction were profound. The jaded renegade Sgt and his rookie enlistee encountered not only the anticipated battles against Axis forces but also the natives. There was a dramatic quartering scene where the ethics and nature of victorious Allies faced the choice to plunder their conquest!

"r-graeber-1","24 February 2015","With a 7,7-rating at the time of writing this, 'Fury' is rated exactly the same as David Ayer's 2012 film 'End Of Watch', which is misleading, quality-wise. Where 'End of Watch' was intense, original, cool and exciting and simply one of the best cop-films in a long while, 'Fury' is quite conventional, shallow, unhistorical and rather dull. If one was hoping for a groundbreaking war movie (I know I was), this is not it.We are treated to the education of a young soldier, reluctant to participate in the inevitable butchery (which incidentally is displayed in images more akin to films like 'Rambo' (2008) or Ayer's more recent 'Sabotage' than 'Saving Private Ryan'), but it turns out he just needs his arm twisted properly by strict but fair father figure ""Wardaddy"" (so much for subtlety) in order to accept the facts of life: war is beastly and you have to do what you have to do to survive, son. Good thing the crew have God on their side and know their bible verses. Soon the rookie, too, will say (and you may doubt your ears, because it is so unmotivated from a character point of view): ""Best job I ever had!"" The tank fights do look impressive, I suppose, although I cannot judge on plausibility and historical accuracy. It has been pointed out in the Message Boards that the excessive use of tracer bullets, while being a cool contemporary effect is probably far exaggerated. That seems to be a negligible objection, but that effect (CGI of course) is so overused that it MAKES the look of the film much in the same way that CGI blood spatters in Slo-mo MADE the look of '300'. It is an eye catcher, but it effectively kills the viewer's immersion into a WWII-era feeling.All in all the whole film is quite irrelevant and will soon be forgotten.","

A film inspired by the shear brotherhood of the tank regiments who fought during World War 2 comes a story of brotherhood and friendship in their finest and darkest hours.BRAD PITT AND TANKS would be enough to sell any movie, but is this film any good? is this film just another Hollywood adaption and glorification of war? And will people be comparing this to 'Saving Private Ryan' because oddly enough it seems to be the case when we mention a war film, Saving takes the biscuit....Well there is certainly no comparison, and this is definitely a stand alone film, that combines some sterling performances, and a heart wrenching reality check on this tragic war. A story set during the later days of World War 2, about a group of men who have fought through thick and thin together, from places as far away as Africa, and have now found themselves in Normandy ever closer to Berlin, and hopefully closer to home. This group of men are the Sherman tank crew of 'Fury' (a title and name we are constantly reminded throughout may I add, as David Ayer persists to include this name in most shots, a name which is written on the tanks turret). This team is led by a war hardened veteran played by Brad Pitt, who's character throughout is the tough leader we want to hate, but find ourselves understanding why he is the way he is, and respect him as this 'father' figure to these men.. A classic case of American 'high ho silver', but what a character he is, with an unmistakable performance from Brad (well obviously, would you expect any less?).Charging into battle with Brad, are three other men, a religious gunman played by Shai LeBeouff (who regardless of the critics opinions, gives a enthralling, tear jerking performance), lead driver Michael Pena and the lose cannon ammunitions man played by the Walking Dead star Jon Bernthal. Fury is missing a second driver/machine gunner as he was killed in action (which we are horrifically shown, as the deceased drivers face is cleaned off the inside of tank). We are introduced the final member of the team, a young type writer drafted in to the unit due to lack of men and equipment, the characters name is Norman 'Machine' Ellison (played by Logan Lerman), its his welcome to the war that draws on the inhumane, vicious reality of war, as this young scared boy has to join the war effort at the hands of a machine gun, to which he has had no training and no experience before.As a history fan it is always nice to know the story is not pretending to base itself on 'real' life, but is a film paying homage to something that happened in some way. World War 2 especially is a topic that Hollywood gets hold of, and will add moments of fiction to something claiming to be entirely real. The story of Fury however, does not do this as there is no reference to this being a real story. On the other hand, it does lacks some detail, and will jump between narrative moments, which can prove a bit confusing and difficult to know where as an audience you are, and at what moment in the story you are in. But what fury lacks slightly in structure, David Ayer allows this film to make up for it in cinematic battles, and heart felt stories between friends. David Ayer has really tried to emphasise the importance of these tank units throughout this war, showing the viewer how at the front of everything these heavy metal shells had to be there first, and always were.As impressive and moving as this film was, there are some areas of fault where the film becomes a bit too 'Hollywood' and far fetched. For instance, at the end of the film our valiant tank 'Fury' roles over a land mine and the tracks are blown clean off one side of the vehicle, causing the tank to become immobile. Norman is sent off to scout the surrounding area whist they try to mend the tank, upon doing so, Norman is met by a three hundred strong unit of SS soldiers armed with panzerschreck's and armoured vehicles. Together five men and a tank survive the night, fending this entire unit off, until all ammunition has ran out. Although they have heavy weaponry mounted on the tank, and a few shells to suppress the onslaught, it is hard to imagine them practically wiping out this highly trained unit of soldiers (especially as they are SS soldiers) and only really losing due to supplies running out. Overall, David Ayer combined with this all star cast has fantastically and emotionally brought to our screens, a depiction of the world surrounding a small unit of men who together saw things that we cant even begin to imagine, and their dream was staying a live just to get home. David Ayer has masterfully captured scenes that will horrifically and brutally remind us all of the reality of this tragic war.... And yes, this film is not perfect, and yes, the film could do with a more tightened storyline. When a film is so brilliantly acted, well written and is cinematically pleasing you will in turn leave the cinema thinking about life during those troubled times, and really appreciate how lucky you are, and question is your job ""The best job I ever had"".","

"michaelradny","11 October 2015","Fury starts out gritty and ends gritty; blood, guts and faces flying all around the place in this violent war action films. However, despite a solid start to the film, the majority of it just doesn't pop, with boring action and fighting sequences, one dimensional characters and a pretty clichéd and rundown storyline. The final scene feels to much like a Tarrentino film, and doesn't fit in with the rest of the films pace and the suspense that is meant to be given just doesn't reach you. Whilst it is moderately entertaining, there are just too many holes and unrealistic scenes to make this a classic war film. Whilst I will say it is a different take on the World War Two battlefront, it just doesn't always connect.","

"kandotom","21 December 2014","Actually, not a bad movie. I am surprised by the large number of scathing user reviews. There are also some very positive reviews, but fewer of them. I suppose the picture is polarizing. I won't say much about the story, so as not to spoil. Just that it's about a small, lonely American tank unit battling its way across Germany during the last few months of World War Two. Lots of violence, but not gratuitous violence. Perhaps the last shoot-out is somewhat over the top. But there is an excellent scene where the invading Americans mix it up with German civilians (women). A good treatment of the good and bad impulses that are both present in the hearts of these brave soldiers. A good treatment of the ""uncivilizing"" process undergone by a rookie soldier (part well played by Logan Lerman). As I said, not a bad movie. It seems to me that many of the overly critical reviewers are confusing their own political feelings with their assessment of the movie's merits (or lack thereof). I am as much against war as the next person; I am close to being a pacifist (and by the way, I grew up in central Europe during World War Two). Yet, I feel that ""Fury"" deserves credit for its nuanced portrayal of these ""warriors.""","

"zachhaayema","17 October 2014","Although well acted and shot with technical detail, Ayers ""Fury"" sacrifice realism and thought- provoking war commentary for clichéd story telling.Perhaps the biggest sin of ""Fury"" is its lack of faith in audience wit. One scene stands out as particularly clichéd. When Don and Norman enter the home of two German women, we as an audience are not at all surprised at how the scenario plays out. Gender roles are immediately assigned as Don and Norman watch the two women make them dinner. Don then suggests Norman have sex with the younger of the two, and all of a sudden two enemies become consensually intimate partners (I understand that this type of scenario was common, with American soldiers bedding German women, but I find it hard to believe the scenario would play out like a romantic drama after knowing each other for a whole 30 seconds). Of course, this is done because Norman has to be the good protagonist that we relate to, rather than the ""animal"" of the character Grady. Wouldn't you know that Grady and his gang show up and of course ruin everything (after all Grady is the animal) and reassure us that Norman is good. Immediately following this sequence, the German town is shelled, and oh no! Normans love interest is dead, buried in a pile of rubble (face up of course, we can't possibly recognize her without the facial features. I mean geez its been a whole 2 minutes since she was last on screen! was she blonde or brunette? I can't remember!) and we understand ""oh ya. War is bad"". Very few creative liberties are taken with this film, and that is why it will go down in history as just another World War 2 film. Nothing new here folks.","

"denis888","31 July 2017","Well, Brad Pitt is good but he is not an almighty superman who ca play any part. At least, he is not good as a tank crew commander in this utter awful WWII flick. All the imaginable clichés are grouped here, all the predictable deaths, battles, shouts, moral lessons, growing heroes tales, mud and fires are here. Silly, utter silly tale of huge unreal goofs, especially when it goes down to tanks and how they survive the fire. The movie is dull, long, forgettable, boring, gray and tasteless. For crying out loud, how many times should we hear all this f-word uttered? Well, war was not a laced ballet, but after all, do we need profanities so much? To sum it up, dead upon arrival. A total waste of time. Bad to the core.","

"ItalianBombshell","1 January 2016","I am an avid fan of WW2 films with historical accuracy. I am also a homeschooling momma. And although this film had more than a few inaccuracies with content and props, I would have to say that, overall, the film was well written and acted. I would not allow my 12year old daughter to view it, but would definitely allow my 17year old nephew to view it. Within the story, I found the focus to slide, quickly, from Wardaddy to Norman. I am sure that it was intentional. But, I would have preferred to learn more about Wardaddy. Especially after viewing Pitt's scarred back and torso when he was cleaning up in the woman's apartment. Also, I do not think that the uncomfortableness of the apartment storyline was either integral or as realistic, considering Wardaddy spoke German. The assumption was that a rape would occur. Viewer's were led through this drawn-out scene...will they/won't they....when the viewer already knew that it wouldn't be a violent interlude. The film established the morality of both characters long before this scene. Overall, a valiant effort. I can understand, easily, where the nominations came from.","

"Mohamad021","16 January 2015","This movie made me say wow. It was such a long time for me to find a movie with a great story and specially vote the movie higher than seven. I have been waiting for this movie since the news talked about it, the story of people who lives in the tank and day in and day out spending time together going from one point to another is just something that we are not seeing in most of movies. It's defiantly has became one of my favourite movies about war, Brad Pitt speaking in German was nice, in most of movies there is always a man who is a translator which makes movies look bad, but i know there are a lot of people out there looking up to Brad Pitt as a role model in their career or they might be a huge fan of his works, it may gives them the idea to go and learn some languages cause that is what the world needs most. Overall i believe this movie is gonna stand in top 20's of all time because of great story line, camera position and sound. it was so obvious that it's not one of those movies who just get famous and forgotten. This one will win bunch of awards for sound, music, camera and a lot of thing and it will be remember.","

"Gordon-11","5 November 2014","This film tells the story of five soldiers in a tank, who valiantly enters deep into Nazi Germany in the Second World War.""Fury"" is the name of the tank that houses the soldiers and keep them alive. It is also the raw emotion that fuels the soldiers to plough on, and the catalyst for the typist to transform into a brave soldier.The story is intensely captivating and moving. It tells how brave the soldiers are in advancing through enemy lines. Yet, it is also human. It shows love and innocence from the typist. It shows leadership and courage from the commander. And even the most courageous can get scared.There is much blood and many gory scenes, but they are not contrived at all. They are there to remind people the horrors of war. When the film ended, I was left dumbfounded for minutes because ""Fury"" is such an effective and powerful film.","

"ryzah","22 October 2014","Hollywood's take on war isn't as bad as it sounds!First and foremost, if you're a stickler for fact and realism, then there will be a few issues, however surely not enough to rate the film 1 star! Americans especially seem to be upset with this portrayal of War, as it shines there heroes as 'bad' at times. I take nothing away from what brave men and women have done throughout history in the name of peace, but the harsh facts are actually mentioned in the film! ""Ideals are great, but more killing is needed to end this war"" ""Kill what's in front of you or be killed and get us killed too"" are snippets from memory, arguing the case for soldiers needing to show harshness to get a job done! The story was created from true memoirs of different veterans that served in tanks. It can't be too far from the truth! There are people like that out there in the world and thank fury because perhaps we'd be Nazi dominated now - Extreme?Back to the film, the acting is sublime from the main cast, which was always inevitable, the intensity of the whole film is fantastic and leaves you gripping the armchair tightly at times, and feeling a sense of trepidation at others, while the storyline is gripping and fun! Not so keen on the laser like shooting, but it made it a spectacle I suppose and the love scene was clearly forced in for the love scene box to be checked and break up the action, but overall the the story, acting and filming from within the tanks was top notch and I recommend a watch!","

"namashi_1","11 December 2014","Set during World War II, 'Fury' is an electrifying war film, that's powerful & intense. Its beautifully filmed, outstandingly directed & remarkably acted! Definitely, among the best films of 2014!'Fury' Synopsis: April, 1945. As the Allies make their final push in the European Theatre, a battle-hardened army sergeant named Wardaddy commands a Sherman tank and his five- man crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. Out-numbered, out-gunned, and with a rookie soldier thrust into their platoon, Wardaddy and his men face overwhelming odds in their heroic attempts to strike at the heart of Nazi Germany.'Fury' is a film, that has the power to disturb you as well as move you. You watch these people turn into monsters, for survival. The narrative is no-holds-barred & extremely violent. You ought to have a really strong stomach to absorb this war epic.David Ayer's Screenplay is tight, offering moments of disturbing yet effective war-scenes, as well as offering emotional depth to its primary characters. Ayer's Direction is outstanding. He has outdone himself in here. Roman Vasyanov's Cinematography is gorgeous. He has captured the film, beautifully. Dody Dorn's Editing is razor-sharp. Art & Costume Design is excellent. Action-Sequences are magnificently executed.Performance-Wise: Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena & Jon Bernthal, are awesome. Pitt, especially, leads the pack with a gripping turn as the leader of his group.On the whole, 'Fury' is a triumph!","

"Rob_Taylor","26 January 2015","It would have been nice if...They had someone who actually had any inkling of tank battle tactics to do the choreography for those scenes. A Tiger tank would not simply sit in one place whilst another tank went behind it. It would either pivot in place to keep its superior forward glacis facing the enemy, or just back away from the approaching tank to acccomplish the same thing. Likewise, in open terrain, there was no need for the tanks in that particular battle to be as close as they were. In short, it was dumb.It would also have been nice if they had someone who could just point out that the behaviour of the German SS in the final battle was just ludicrous. Oh look! There's an American tank at a crossroads. It looks like it is destroyed. Let's not send some scouts ahead to check, but just all bundle up to it as if we aren't in the middle of a frickin' war! And, once the ruse was uncovered, the SS all act like completely inept lemmings, throwing themselves repeatedly at the tank armed with ineffectual sidearms.I suspect the point of the movie was to show that war is hell and good people can turn bad, but there was really nothing much likable about the tank crew at all. Most of them came across as loud-mouth, drunken jocks for the most part. In the end, their deaths meant little to me as a viewer and even the token act of kindness at the end had me rolling my eyes.Some people have praised the ""realism"" of this movie, but honestly, there isn't much on display here.But... you said you enjoyed it! Well, yes i said I somewhat enjoyed it. Putting aside the nonsense above, I enjoyed the acting on display. Even Brad Pitt wasn't as wooden as normal and I was pleasantly surprised by Shia LaBoeuf and Jon Bernthal, though the latter is getting typecast as an a-hole I think. The cast gave it their all, though Jason Isaacs was wasted in his token role.Though I disliked the characters, the actors made me believe they were real enough. It is just a shame the plot wasn't up to the task of being as believable.SUMMARY: Some nice acting, but unlikable characters and woeful lack of common sense in the action scenes make this a bit of a chore to wade through. A nice idea, but needed a few more technical advisors, methinks.","

"abcvision","31 January 2015","War is hell and we can't imagine the feeling of being in battle. But I believe that Fury does a good job of bringing that complexity of the fog of war onto the big screen. In Fury, Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Brad Pitt) does a good job an average soldier rising to the occasion. He is leading a group of men in the finally of the European theatre in 1945. He has a deadly mission behind enemy lines. This cohort is outmanned, outgunned, and out strategized. These boys struggle to make it but know they are fighting for a bigger cause than themselves. The movie takes you to the front line and the complexity of trying to stay alive while there is death all around. More than a war movie, it is one that shares the story of forgotten heros. The men who risked it all for freedom. One heck of a movie. Wilson Trivino","

"ClaytonDavis","29 October 2014","You want some intensity, heart palpitations, and just sheer pulse- pounding action? You don't need to look much further than David Ayer's monumental war film ""Fury"" with an all-star cast that includes Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Shia LeBeouf, Michael Pena, and Jon Bernthal. In the vein of any edge-of-your-seat thrill ride experienced over the past few years, ""Fury"" ignites a passionate look at the brotherhood of war and the beauty that can peak its head out every now and again. Honest, raw, and vividly shot, Ayer's war epic stands as one of the best surprises the year has offered.With elements of Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" and a ""dinner scene"" that would put ""Django Unchained"" to absolute shame, ""Fury"" is full of wit, charm, and affection. The film takes place in April 1945 Germany. A five-man crew of a Sherman tank, lead by a battle- hardened sergeant named Wardaddy, take on near-impossible odds to hit the heart of the opposition towards the end of the war. When a rookie infantry member joins the group, they will learn several things about each other, and ultimately themselves, in the face of a motherless war.How can you start anywhere else, without beginning with the writer and director David Ayer? Already gaining a legion of fans following ""End of Watch,"" the impressive filmmaker takes on a new realm of storytelling that feels intimate, and consequently real. We spend over 60% of the film, inside the belly of a mechanical beast. Paul Greengrass executed a similar take with ""Captain Phillips"" last year in the lifeboat, and Ayer illustrates the same quality that is sure to be appreciated and loved. From a directorial standpoint, Ayer is unmatched by any action filmmaker that has hit screens this year. He owns every shot, every emotion, and every ounce of pride that the cast and crew exhibit. He controls the ship (or in this case TANK) with an effortless ease. There will be no doubt that this is a testosterone driven film, and the average movie guy will be screaming from the rooftops in an action-packed blissful state. However, there is an emotional core that is so very present in every scene, even when its ugly, that it allows an accessibility to every movie-goer. You won't find a more genuine depiction of war since ""The Hurt Locker.""From a writing standpoint, Ayer puts forth a solidly valiant effort, with minor missteps along the way. I would have wanted less clichéd behaviors from certain characters at times, even some richer dialogue. Ayer constructs his story with precision. He absolutely knows when, what, and how he wants his characters to react. Every action feels fluid, and moving towards an ultimate resolution. He finds the beats of a scene quite well and at over two hours, the film moves like a freight train. You never feel a second. I do feel that Ayer missed out on some opportunities for a ""real"" breakthrough in a character, or a revealing quality of a character that didn't feel like I've seen it before. There were moments that were predictable but in no way do they bog down the overall experience of ""Fury.""A slick and magnetic ensemble are present on screen. This is one of the best performances that Brad Pitt has ever done. Continuously pushing himself as an actor, his depth and vigor are both alluring and hypnotic to watch. The real breakout star of the film is none other than Logan Lerman. Already exhibiting an awards worthy performance in Stephen Chbosky's ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" over two years ago, if there was any doubt that this young man is one of the most exciting actors to watch, they should be laid to rest. Lerman is sensational from front to end. Calling back some young actors that have played in war films and have stood out (I kept coming back to Jeremy Davies' unrequited work in ""Saving Private Ryan""), he plainly steals the movie from underneath every actor's eye. Lerman's work is an awards- caliber performance that the Academy Awards should not hesitate to recognize.Co-stars Jon Bernthal, Michael Pena, and especially Shia LeBeouf all have individual moments to shine. Bernthal is a tornado of frenzy rage, taking out everything in his path. LeBeouf calls back to his stunning work in ""A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints"" from nearly a decade ago. Quietly powerful but loudly present. Pena is your most underwritten and clichéd character, but someone of Pena's talent ability, rises above in nearly every instance.""Fury"" has an abundance of technical highlights. Recent Oscar- winning composer Steven Price, puts forth another emotionally resonate score that stands out. Cinematographer Roman Vasyanov captures shots of anxiety and concentration that only a master could accomplish. Film Editor Dody Dorn, who's crowning work will always be Christopher Nolan's ""Memento,"" should be commended for making a 135 minute war epic, feel like a fleeting anxiety attack.""Fury"" is an emotional extremity. You don't get films like this that both operate on an accessible entertainment level for all audiences and still remain awards-caliber. It's a tremendous achievement, unforgettable, and one of the richly rewarding films of the year.","

"drazsika-716-814820","30 October 2014","Just watched Fury and the movie -unexpectedly- made me think of several subjects I never thought before.While showing the horror of WW II very naturalistically the movie brings in a lot of already-seen-already-felt emotions from other war movies, uses techniques we all know very well with very good acting in this definitely ""male"" topic one can easily feel the senselessness of war. It still comes second after Saving Private Ryan from US WW II movies for me.At the end one might think about the feeling of duty - sacrificing one's life consciously for an order in an obvious suicide mission, fighting till last breath (both on US and German side) when you might not have too much to do with what you are fighting for.We are not here to judge what is right or wrong. [...] Our duty is to kill Germans. - as we can hear from the Wardaddy (Brad Pitt), commander of the tank called ""Fury"" before forcing the newcomer private (Logan Lerman) to shoot a German soldier. A mentality one could find in any army unit from SS to any present (from North Korean to ISIS) army. Duty comes first even if it is about killing others or a suicide mission. Whether you come out as a hero or a devil is the future's dilemma.And while it's a commonplace that winners write history it's interesting to think a little bit about who'll become winners and what fanaticism it takes to win a war.","

"Sergeant_Tibbs","8 November 2014","It's been a long time since we've had a good World War II film that's in the middle of combat. It seems to have been topped by the twofer of Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line 15 years ago. The thing with war films is that no matter how intentional or not the approach is, it holds an inherent social commentary on the development of how violence and conflict between two countries is portrayed. It goes for western too, there's politics. If the film is smart, it'll do something with it. Fury doesn't seem to have anything to say. It doesn't have to, but it results in a film that doesn't have anything to take away from it. Perhaps on a deeper level there's something to study regarding it's theme of masculinity, given the all-male cast (save for an appearance from Anamaria Marinca) and the phallus symbolism of guns and tanks, but it's not coherent enough to take anything from it. Instead, it seems it has some small things to say about ends justifying means and religious morality, but it doesn't exactly resonate or feel fully developed. However, Fury is generally inoffensive.The biggest problem is that it lulls too often. We spend 24 hours with this unit on their journey and it suffers from constantly stopping and starting the story. It inches character development, but not enough to really chew on outside of archetypes. The performances are generally strong, especially from an underused Shia LaBeouf, with the highlight being Logan Lerman. I couldn't really enjoy Perks of a Wallflower but here he showed his chops, even if he isn't quite measured. Brad Pitt is always a good presence to have and he certainly anchors the movie in a comfortable place. Unfortunately it's just quite sloppy. It achieves a gritty and gory atmosphere of war by being utterly drenched in smoke, though evidently they had to borrow the lasers from Star Wars so we could see the bullets. It struggles to hold tension due to the liberties in logic it takes and not being able to invest in and follow the action. Its best chances are nominations are with the sound categories, but they're kind of a given in this genre. It is good to see a film that doesn't rush, which happens far too often these days with hyperactive editing, but Fury drags in places where it doesn't have to go.6/10","

"SimonJack","18 April 2015","For all its hype about creating a real ""feeling"" for this movie, the Columbia team hasn't managed to fool many people. I appreciated the many reviewers who saw how unreal this film is. Now, how can anyone today - seven decades after WWII know what was real? Well, by the stories and news we grew up with during and in the years right after the war. And the many books, novels, diaries, and movies produced in the first few decades after the war. And, in the newsreels, we watched in theaters, and the live action filming for documentaries. Until the 21st century, most criticism of the Hollywood productions about WWII were that they often glorified the American GIs in combat, or they too often involved romances that the bulk of the fighting men never experienced, or that the equipment used for the movies wasn't accurate. The early WWII films didn't show the graphic gore of war that ""Saving Private Ryan"" ushered into films in 1998; but many of those films showed the angst, anguish, fear, fatigue, and other aspects of war on the men fighting it. And, most did not make the enemy out to be inept; but very formidable combatants.A special bonus short documentary with the DVD of ""Fury"" has interviews with some of the main actors. Brad Pitt, Shia LeBeouf, Logan Lerman and Jon Bernthal talk about their preparation for the film. A Navy SEAL team apparently ""trained"" the actors for a week of what GIs would have gone through in basic training. So, their testimonials were that they learned to bond as a group in that one week. Really? And, while basic training is similar in all the services, would the Navy know more about tank training? One suspects that the movie makers were trying to hype the film by using the latest men of the military spotlight in their movie project. In reality, I doubt that the actors would have had any better training or learned to bond as brothers than if their trainers had been Special Forces, Rangers, Paratroopers, Marines, or regular Army training units. Hmmm. Why not even an armored unit?The narrator of the short documentary said the movie makers met behind closed doors with a few WWII vets - now in their 90s, from the 2nd Armored Division. He said that the vets told them stories that they had never told even to family members. Interestingly, the filmmakers don't claim that the movie is based in any way on what they heard from the veterans. Again, some modern day Hollywood hype, I suspect.I appreciated the comments of those early reviewers who point out some of the most obvious aspects of the film that deny its reality. This is the most foul-mouthed bunch of GIs I've ever heard and can imagine. Yes, those men of my father's age were known to curse, swear or cuss on occasion. But it was not their common language. I served in the Army from 1961 to 1964, and we too used an occasional cuss or swear word. Occasional, not part of our running, everyday language. The same is true today, the younger service people tell me. So, the ""Fury"" filmmakers aren't giving us a look at reality of the closing days of combat in WWII Germany. No, they are giving us here a modern portrayal of a time past.This ""unreality"" check applies equally to the portrayal of the Germans in the long closing battle scene. Brad Pit's character, Sergeant Don Collier even notes that the approaching Germans are a crack SS battalion. And, the film seems to portray such. So this large force of crack German troops in so inept that the Americans are able to mow most of them down in a very long pitched battle from one immobile tank position smack dab out in the open. The Germans fire a couple anti- tank torpedoes that don't do much damage, and they don't shoot anymore.Besides these major detractions for this film, ""Fury"" has a weak script and character parts that just aren't very interesting or believable. Can anyone imagine that all, most or even a significant number of American GIs were all so completely hardened and able to dismiss killing as though it were nothing? From the beginning, the performances seemed forced. It seemed to me that the selling point for the film is intended to be the amount of gore and fabricated and exaggerated action that they could produce. The film seemed more to me like a video game than a realistic portrayal of a unit in WWII combat.It seems that Hollywood is trying to reinvent WWII for audiences in the 21st century. This is one modern film that just doesn't accurately reflect the culture of the 1940s. So, it doesn't have a place in my war film library. If young buffs today want a more accurate ""feel"" for WWII, they can watch almost any of the many Hollywood films made about the war by the major studios through the 1980s. And, even later films by the movie industries in European countries.","

"rpete528","17 December 2014","I saw this movie twice before it left the theaters. I don't care what anyone posts in here regarding their dislike for this movie. This movie was great. Were there similarities to other movies, yes. Some clichés, yes. Find me a movie that doesn't. I love the way the movie was made. The characters personalities and the way they clash. I thought the way the battle scenes were filmed were done exceptionally. Was the last scene over the top? Yeah it might be. Then again, it might not. This movie is a lot better than what some of the reviews here give credit for. Definitely go see this movie. It will keep you in suspense. You may also want to see this for a second time....like I did.","

"christophwc","4 November 2015","If you are familiar with Nabokov's, ""Pale Fire"", you may notice David Ayer is using a similar ""secret perspective"" to tell us the story of Fury. Just as Pale Fire uses crafted anomalies in the narration and index, Fury uses (less subtly) visual elements and vocabulary to suggest our watchers' vantage is somewhere else entirely. From the tracer rounds and Gordo's/Pena's fashion articles to the logic defying final battle, the seemingly cliché and predictable picture is transformed into an uncommon and welcome vehicle of storytelling. We are witness to history not through documented fact, but through a tale having long ago already transcended to legend.One can reasonably expect Fury to be a serious war film, which it certainly is, but not from adhering to historical accuracy. It is a serious war movie in the vein of all war stories as exaggerated and changed over many years and retelling through the participants (and later, their succeeding generations).I would ask people treat legend differently than sterile history. By doing so, you might find Fury to be a masterpiece in far-fetched war story (like many WWII tales our grandparents told us) and no less gripping or important than say, Saving Private Ryan.Follow David Ayers on-screen cues and let the movie reveal itself! A movie of a powerful myth with grandpa's story as both screenplay and script!","

"oscaralbert","25 November 2014",". . . it's still as if some ""fair and balanced"" world version of Fox News is behind its revisionist ""history."" Everyone knows that the biggest name connected to FURY, Brad Pitt, fancies himself a One Worlder now. But FURY could have earned a rating of ""10,"" like Warner Brothers' LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA, if its distributors had exercised their prerogative of editorial oversight. No such luck here. Japan's Sony Corporation continued its assault on American Values with FURY, which is no surprise when you consider that Sony's Japan was Hitler's Best Friend. So rather than a manly frontal attack, FURY tries to bamboozle those too young to remember Tojo with dozens of sneaky slights to America peppered throughout its long 134-minute duration. Flattering pictures of Germany's dictator, Adolf Hitler, pop up here, there, and everywhere; not even one photo of America's beloved WWII leader, FDR, is in sight. Wounded G.I.s shoot themselves in the head, rather than sticking it out till the medics arrive. Newbies are forced to violate the rules of war by gunning down unarmed German P.O.W.s, as sort of the second step in gang initiation (Step One being slopping up the face of their predecessor into a bucket). Adding insult to injury, German Nazis are shown WINNING the tank named FURY's final battle! With all the Japanese and German cars on our U.S. highways today, it's not surprising that many American high schoolers think that WE lost WWII! Who could blame them, with untruthful spectacles such as FURY in our Megaplexes?","

"estebangonzalez10","19 December 2014","""Ideals are peaceful. History is violent.""When it comes to approaching war films, every director seems to have a certain agenda in the way they are going to portray it. David Ayer's approach is summed up in that simple quote, delivering a war film that portrays the cruelty and rawness of war in a rather visual way. Ayer has had more misses than hits as a director, but if there is something he knows how to direct it is action set pieces. He may not be the greatest story teller and most of his characters aren't developed at all, but when it comes to action scenes he directs them with great detail. Fury is at its best when it centers on the action and stays away from the dialogue and character buildup. Very few war films have centered on soldiers fighting from inside a tank perhaps due to the physical constraints so in a way Fury is unique (unless you have seen the foreign film Lebanon which takes place entirely inside a tank). David Ayer isn't the first director who has experimented with this, but he does deliver a solid and entertaining film with gruesome action scenes. Saving Private Ryan has changed the way films portray war, and Fury is one of those war films that has been influenced by it. I can't recall another war film that depicts the cruelty of war in such an authentic and raw manner as Fury does. Fury is my second favorite film from David Ayer, but I still think End of Watch is his best. However, it's a huge improvement over his previous film, Sabotage.The characters in Fury are clichéd, we've seen them before in many other war films, but the action scenes are unique and engaging. Even Brad Pitt's Wardaddy feels like a similar character from Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds without that heavy southern accent. The rest of the crew that Fury focuses on also play the usual stereotypes from numerous war films of the past. Logan Lerman plays the new boy who doesn't seem to belong to this violent world, but who we will see transformed by the effects of war. Shia LaBeouf is the Christian soldier who will throw out a pair of Bible verses in between fights. Michael Peña is the wise cracking latino and Jon Bernthal the bully who is the hardest to sympathize with. These are the five crew members inside the Sherman tank that the film centers on. Despite not being unique characters and often quite dislikable, the actors give strong performances. Brad Pitt is great as the Sergeant, although at times his star power does get in the way. I still enjoyed his performance very much. Shia LaBeouf was a surprise as well, he delivered a credible performance. The easiest character to engage with was Logan Lerman's, who delivered a surprisingly strong performance as well. The entire cast was solid despite playing clichéd characters. There is a sequence in the middle of the film that feels out of place and hurt the overall pacing of the film, but the final 30 minutes will have you at the edge of your seat again. It is intense.","

"RforFilm","21 October 2014","Passing down the street, I see all sorts of people, young and old. They present themselves as how they want the rest of the world wants to see them. For guys like me that enjoy walking, I often pass by folks with caps that say they were veterans of some sort. They don't seem to be asking for a lot of attention, but they want people to know that they worked hard to protect us from villains. They took the risk that could have gotten them killed, but had managed to put out enough to take themselves home. They may have been able to return to a normal society, but some of them may not come back with solid minds.I have only seen people killed in the movies and television, and I don't have the stomach to look up death footage, but from what I hear, the real deal is nothing like the Stallone that can gun down a bunch of bad guys and return home with a smile. The armed folk that have seen how severe and bloody a war can become only see the world for what it can be; a savage place where only the strongest survive. The sick minds that fill the ranks in Fury will make you question just how damaged a veterans mind could be.Our crew is in the last months of World War II as Army sergeant Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (played by Brad Pitt) commands a Sherman tank called ""Fury"", working to make the final push into Nazi Germany. It's crew consists of Boyd ""Bible"" Swan (played by Shia LeBeouf), Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis (played by Jon Bernthal) and Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia (played by Michael Peña). During the opening segment where an assistant driver is lost in an attack, an enlisted typist, Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) is unfortunately transferred to fill the vacant spot.What Ellison finds is a crew that would rather have their old driver back then someone who has never even killed a Nazi. During a gut-wrenching scene, the poor boy gets his bitter taste of blood when Wardaddy forces the trigger of his gun upon a German who may have been innocent. Ironically, Wardaddy is the only one who seems to be keen on making Ellison a full- fledged tank driver, by giving him the privilege of joining him for food in a captured town. The stakes are put to test when the tank becomes immobilized after driving on a land mind and has be ready to aim and fire upon hundreds of incoming Nazis.Fury places itself in the ideology of something like The Dirty Dozen where a group of solders are pitted against absurdly huge forces. But it comes off more like The Expendables where the action becomes so over the top that it nearly becomes senseless. I can tell that the movie was trying to mix in the bloody (and I mean really bloody!) along with the message that war can damage to the human mind and it nearly works. The effect of war on people in film has been done several times before, so what Fury does have to offer are some good performances. Brad Pitt plays the total opposite of his Inglorious Bastards character, becoming someone who has become so scared by the war that he is more machine then human. Logan Lerman is really evolving into the serious adult actor that he wants to be, as he displays the only traces of humanity left in an Evil Germany. The best part of the movie is the final act of the stuck tank and it's last stand, but you need to get through the roughest trenches of gore and slow pacing that could turn away some folk. Fury is an interesting case of being too gory for an award audience and possibly to highbrow for a mainstream crowd. I'm sure there's a middle ground that going to enjoy this more then I did.I'll give this six-damaged tanks out of five. It's best to know that Fury is not fun action movie, but an action movie at least. If that's enough to persuade you, this is probably for you. Maybe the next round of World War II ammo can fuel me better.","

"smatysia","8 May 2015","While I was certainly aware of it, this film brings home the horrible brutality of tank warfare. The constant expectation of fiery death must make one rather fatalistic. Aside from the modern tendency toward excessive gore, this movie was evocative of war films from the Fifties and Sixties. Pretty decent acting all around, led by the low-key Brad Pitt. A couple of notes on plot holes. By April 1945, the German army was extremely depleted due to the millions of casualties sustained up to that point, doubtless including even Waffen SS units. So the extreme expertise that some have speculated about in previous comments may be exaggerated. However, as has also been noted, no military unit will allow itself to be chewed to pieces by immobile troops in a defensive position that can easily be bypassed. This has been military doctrine since the Hittites. Still a very intense war movie experience.","

"DareDevilKid","9 November 2014","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.3/5 starsThe first thing that you notice inn ""Fury"" is the mud. Even more than the copious blood and violence, it represents the defining visual element of ""Fury"". It's everywhere. Feet are caked with it. Tires and treads churn it under. Roads - if they can be called that - are paved with it. Rarely has a World War II film depicted just how filthy everything was during the 1945 slog across Germany's rural country on the race to Berlin. If writer/director David Ayer is to be credited with nothing else, he gets this right, illustrating that, unlike what's shown in less historically exacting war films, the final push for the Allies was no post-D-Day picnic.Tanks have featured in countless war movies yet rarely been the focus of those films. Slow, hulking and claustrophobic, they lack the 'glamour' of planes, the scale of battleships and the vulnerability of the lone soldier. Two rare exceptions are 1943's ""Sahara"" and 1988's ""The Beast of War"", both of which centered on lone tank crews bravely engaging the enemy against seemingly impossible odds. In that vein, ""Fury"" is a fitting new addition. In the closing stages of the Second World War, a single US Sherman M4 tank (baring the nickname from which the film takes its title), is tasked with holding a vital crossroads deep behind German lines. Led by their tough-as-nails sergeant, ""Wardaddy"" Don Collier (Brad Pitt), the crew includes Bible-thumping Boyd Swan (Shia LaBeouf), pugnacious Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal), and immigrant Gordo Garcia (Michael Pena) - a hardened bunch of veterans who do not take kindly to their new, fresh-faced draftee, Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman), whose mobile armored experience consists of knowing how to operate a typewriter. The fifth seat in the tank, tragically vacated, is filled by this typist-turned-gunner/driver, who is as unenthused about being with the four as they are about having him there.Norman's initiation is quick and uncompromising. His first job is to wipe down the tank's interior and scrub away the fleshy remains of his predecessor. Then its straight into action, where the true horrors of the conflict are seen, felt and heard all around. One thing ""Fury"" does exceptionally well is demonstrate precisely how devastating a tank was to anything less than another one (unless that other one was the German ""Tiger"", whose forward-facing armor made it invulnerable to all US counterparts). ""Ideals are peaceful"", explains Wardaddy, ""history is violent"", and the sound of enemy shells tearing holes through the sky as they blaze past or into the American units is a terrifyingly violent experience.Indeed, all the combat scenes in ""Fury"" are brutally graphic, offering a ""Saving Private Ryan"" level of gruesome reality to the war experience, even if the film as a whole fall slightly short of meeting the lofty standards of Spielberg's ultimate war classic. Bodies are burned, shredded and liquefied, yet what truly startles is the matter-of-factness with which the other soldiers regard it all. This is the final stage of the conflict, remember, by which time most troops had experienced years of dehumanizing savagery. ""It's just war!"" one of them explains to Norman, whose revulsion to the death around him is neatly reflective of the audience's.Brad Pitt's Don is a toned-down version of the memorable character he played in Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglorious Bastards"". Though this role might not have the same impact as the Tarantino-scripted one, it's still noteworthy for portraying Don to be just as determined and uncompromising but far less gung-ho. He lives by a code of honor with principle #1 being to keep his men alive and principle #2 follows Patton's directive about killing Nazis. In particular, he has no sympathy for the SS. The only good one is a dead one, and it doesn't matter if he has surrendered. Pitt is more than believable in this role, and completely vanishes into the character. His performance is genuinely affecting - barking orders, maintaining camaraderie, and at times being brutal to the point of risking real inhumanity, as when he forces Norman to shoot a captured German soldier in the back just to give him the experience of doling out death. Yet there are other moments when he is able to shed that horrible armor for just a few minutes, and convey a man who is terribly frightened, not only of his own possible death, but of what he may have become in keeping himself and the others alive. Logan Lerman doesn't have Pitt's screen presence, but he fills the role of the clerk-turned-warrior capably. His character has the longest and most extreme arc. Shia LaBeouf, who may or may not retire from acting after this performance, fulfills the promise that once had Hollywood insiders predicting great things from him. Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal ably fill out the quintet.David Ayer has directed a work that moves with a cinematic force; even grace. It is a difficult film to discount. From the vivid, fluid photography (Roman Vasyanov) to the mournful and muscular score (Steven Price), ""Fury"" is irrefutably crafted. Over two hours long it is tense going, a sturdily acted affair, and yet, as the author of this drama, Ayer has penned a work that takes us no place new, or illuminating, or even exciting, but what it does manage to do is give us a brutally realistic war film. ""Fury"" is a war movie as much as an anti-war movie, with an emphasis on the horrors of war, and which minimizes the heroic aspects of being a soldier. In this film, war really is hell.","

"Uriah43","28 December 2014","It's April 1945 and the war in Germany is rapidly coming to an end. However, Adolf Hitler and the Nazis refuse to surrender just yet and are putting up as much of a fierce defense as they can. This movie follows a specific tank crew as they fight their way forward against stiff resistance. Of particular concern is the fact that their Sherman tank is quite inferior to the Tiger tank of the Germans. However, the tank commander, ""Don Collier"" (Brad Pitt) is both dedicated and determined and he has a well-seasoned crew serving with him. Unfortunately, after an extremely fierce battle he loses one of his men and the replacement named ""Norman Ellison"" (Logan Lerman) is too young and inexperienced to handle the job right away. As a result, he is not only a danger to the crew but to himself as well. Now rather than reveal any more of this film and risk ruining it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a very good movie which had outstanding action and seemed realistic from start to finish. Definitely worth a watch.","

"FlashCallahan","2 December 2014","Army sergeant Wardaddy, is the commander of a Sherman tank. Determined to strike a decisive victory for the Allies in the European Theatre, Wardaddy leads his five-man crew on a treacherous mission behind enemy lines. His mission is complicated by the sudden appearance of a rookie soldier in his platoon, the sergeant knows that victory is within reach, and vows to achieve it by any means necessary.....Yep, it's another War is Hell movie, and by no means am I sniping at anybody who fought in any War, they are heroes, and fought among other things, for Queen, Country, and Freedom of speech.The film mainly consists of Brad's Army (ha ha), moving from one scenario to the next, meeting up with Jason Issacs, who outgrizzles everyone on screen. And Brad's Army has all the usual suspects you'd see in your atypical war movie.There's the new one, there's the two Bolshevik ones who are horrible to the new one, there is the quiet logical, and there is the tank.Oh, and as usual there is a scene with the new one involving a begging German and an Allie trying to get him to kill him.Seen it all before, many a time.But the action scenes are totally adequate, and there is a wonderful scene about halfway though the film where Pitt and Lerman hole themselves up with two German women, before being rudely interrupted by their colleagues.If the rest of the film was like this fifteen minute scene, it could have been one of the films of the year.Instead, its Brad Pitt in a tank, but you'll be yearning for Brad in Inglorious Ahems","

"nemogirl7","13 November 2021","I'll keep it short. The whole thing is very heavy handed, a trite attempt at gravity. So much so it weighs like a tank. I felt like I was watching a film made by that kid whose obsessed with everything WWII, all the gory details and wants to impress everyone by showing how awful it was. There's a weird kind of voyeurism to it aswell, a display, a performance. Call it war porn with a mirror.Having seen some rare and exceptional war films like The Victors (1963), When Trumpets Fade (1998), Come & See (1985), this really doesn't compare to the depth and sensitivity of these largely forgotten films. Watch this by all means, but seek out these others.","

"regginblack","7 November 2014","I am worn out after watching Fury. It was an intense film that left me tense throughout. I even found myself letting out deep sighs, as I was holding my breath without knowing. Fury is an amazing film, and a demanding experience.I had a few doubts about certain parts of this film before seeing it. First, I am not a fan of Shia Labeouf. Second, the previews made Brad Pitt look like he was revisiting his role as Aldo Raine from Inglourious Basterds. Finally, as with most war films, there is a tendency to include a handful of worn out clichés.Let me put the minds at ease of anybody that had those same worries. Labeouf was amazing in his role, and didn't ham up his character. Pitt may have looked like Aldo, but he was anything but. As far as clichés go, there were a couple. For instance, chambering a round in a gun that has been, or should have been, already chambered. For the most part, the film avoided clichés though.I am a fan of war films. I have watched every kind from any country I can get them from. This has to be the best war film I have ever watched. Details are important in a war film, and those details were carefully provided in Fury. Everything looked like one would expect. Things were dirty, worn, and sometimes broken. Fury showcases a war, not a parade.Speaking of parades, the US army didn't parade around like saviors in this. They were exhausted, angry, and fighting battles they didn't always win. There weren't showers, laundromats, or shoe shines. Fury portrays the war as violent, gruesome, gut-wrenching, wearisome, and grinding. Soldiers weren't all choir boys, and Fury made sure to portray that fact.I can't speak on the technicals of the actual film making process, I'm not qualified, but I do know that there were beautiful shots throughout. The musical score only emphasized the emotion of each scene. It was truly beautiful. Adding to that beauty was the battle scenes.The battle scenes were masterfully done. Bullets and shells flew through the air like one would expect. Not every pull of the trigger was a hit. Shells skipped along surfaces. Bullets came hard and fast. Earth moved with explosions and gun fire. The tracer rounds lit the screen up, as did the tanks shells exploding, especially those with Willy Pete, or white phosphorous, in them. So, during an extreme battle, there was violence dancing with visual beauty.The main characters weren't fully fleshed out with back stories and motivations that were easily perceived, but I felt like this was one of the strongest points of the film. I still cared about each of the crew, but like them, I didn't want to know their whole bio. They were part of a strong tank crew, and their backgrounds were often nuanced. The film didn't feel like it was supposed to be about the characters, it was much larger than that. The film is about a war that a generation of men and boys fought. This war involved killing and being killed. It wasn't pretty -- it was a dog fight. Every inch of land was taken, earned by those men. In that moment, there wasn't good or bad, there were just two sides trying to kill the other. Fury is about a war.In closing, I highly recommend this film. It easily became my favorite war film, and that is saying a lot.","

"georgecoffeynewyorker","24 November 2014","I popped along to see Fury. It was quite interesting. The plot was slightly confusing. The descriptor of the movies was confusing. Bottomline, you'd have to have read up about World War 2 in the past. I would have been thought some of it, in school alrite. Anyways back to the film, the film surrounds Don(Pitt), Bible(LeBouf), Norman(Lerman) who was recently added to the group, Trini(Pena), Grady(Bernthal). As I understand, they go from Town to Town fighting and fighting. Literally that's the case. They encounter one town, whereby Norman and Don are at a house. And as Norman is so under stress and distressed. He plays the piano and a lovely piece. You can see the happiness in his smile. I found that heartwarming. Considering what he's been through etc., etc., Sadly ALL but one perish in the final town. The Tank fell victim to a mine. So with that, they were stuck. One cool thing about the movie thou was we got to see INSIDE a tank. It was so awesome. So overall not bad a movie.","

"orourkec-292-269155","9 November 2014","In life I've almost never been interested in trying world war movies. If I'm not interested in trying a world war movie, it doesn't ever mean that I don't think I'll like it. My bets to whether I'll like them are 50% chances. It's just that I prefer to watch a film genre which is my favorite and which therefore gives me excitement in advance before I go to see this movie for the first time at the cinema. If it's not my favorite genre then I don't have much excitement in advance before I go and see it and I don't always accept that. That's the way I personally work with my mind. Somewhat, for FURY, which is a WW II film, the feeling was different and by this I mean that I looked forward to see it. Now, how come? Maybe it was because there was Brad Pitt and because I heard from my father and brothers that he is a really good actor. Even if so (knowing myself) I still don't think I would have wanted to see a film with Brad Pitt if it is a movie genre I'm not interested in so that would be weird if that really was the reason why I felt excited to see FURY! Or maybe it is because I just naturally started developing tastes in trying different genres I don't watch much because of teenage maturity. Or maybe it is something else whatever it is! Anyways I'm glad to say that I liked FURY mostly because of the way it was acted! It wasn't just well acted just like this - it was staggeringly well acted and some of the acting there has gone beyond my expectations (sure as hell it did) and marked me tremendously, and that tremendous impact on me from the acting came mostly from Brad Pitt's character! It is the acting that made Brad Pitt's character feel like a particularly interesting and damn believable character and he really was in fact! Brad Pitt was truly at his best here (in his acting not his performance) playing a Sergeant that acts and behaves like a mean character but is like that not for the sake of being mean but is like that because he is affected from his past experiences with the war and tries to teach other people about the cold reality of war for their own good. His character was brutal and so unbearable and that's what made him an excellent, truly original character to me! In fact, Brad Pitt's character was just so brutal that I couldn't help but wonder at first if he actually was an unkind guy in the deep of himself but as his character continued to develop 'till the end of the movie it became obvious to me that he in fact is a kind man in the deep of himself. Even if it is a WW II motion picture, this motion picture also had a few funny moments. Ahhhhh, humor is really what puts me in such a good mood and warms my mood of excitement like a jack- oozy that warms down my body when I watch films and that's how I felt like when I witnessed a few funny moments in FURY. And the dialogs are smart and very well done too! Other great things: the movie is sensitively portrayed, the addition of the new, young and unexperienced recruit in Wardaddy's tank crew in the storyline, the new recruit's inexperience causing trouble to the crew in the face of danger, the depiction of the horrors of war are suitably raw, the cast is strong and the char battle scenes are suspenseful. However, the movie has a few flaws. Two of them are that while Brad Pitt makes his character act in an exceptionally good way, some of the other actors playing the principal characters of the movie fit too simply into their characters and should get a bit of complexity + the movie doesn't fully live up to its larger ambitions. Nonetheless, the movie's overall outstandingly well handed direction helps save itself My rating: 7.7/10","

"Simply-Red","22 May 2016","I want to give this movie 10 stars, but there is something in the end that just takes that little bit off of perfect.Granted, I am a sucker for war action flicks and I do not know the technicalities that some could point out as unrealistic.I found myself saying ""Oh heck yea!"" out loud, but with the other ""H"" word several times. The battle scenes were great for me. I found myself even saying ""now THAT is worth dying for"" because just having that experience would be priceless. Makes me think about all of our combat warriors and what they go through...the excitement and mortal fear...everything.Like Wardaddy and his tank crew say in this flick ""Best Job I ever had"".This movie is grotequly violent...like war is for real. But it had my wife's undivided attention throughout and she has a tendency to fall asleep watching war flicks","

"paulclaassen","20 February 2022","Crucify me if you want for saying this, but I can't help but wonder whether there actually is a God when I watch war movies. The horrors of war are inhumane and I can't believe a god actually allowed this to happen to human beings.Ok, my religious views aside, the film disturbingly illustrates the horrors of war - and how one man would kill another without remorse simply because men in suits in offices told them to do so. Shocking! 'Fury' is brutal and realistic in that respect.Brad Pitt stars as Don Collier, a hardened sergeant with a soft heart when the situation calls for it. This is a war movie, so expect foul language (at least not nearly as bad as that disgusting 'Full Metal Jacket'!). Although Pitt is the lead character, Logan Lerman stole the show as Norman. He was fantastic! I sympathized with him every step of the way. He is my favourite character in the movie with the best character development.'Fury' is a different kind of war movie; this is a tank war film, and revolves mainly around tanks. Hollywood's version of the 2012 Russian film 'White Tiger', if you will. Much of the film is shot inside the tank, so some scenes do tend to be a bit claustrophobic. Nevertheless, 'Fury' is an exceptionally well made film with a great 30-minute finale. The film does have quite a long running time, but it is well worth it.It might not be for everyone, so choose your audience wisely. As for me, I enjoyed it, although there were plenty of very disturbing scenes.","

"jamesgg","1 December 2014","Any technical / military / tank specifics aside, which I'm not equipped to comment on, this was shaping up to be at least a very good, possibly great, movie.Right up to the point when the final battle began. I don't want to go into details so as not to spoil anything, but let's just say, it turns into basically a bad B-level-Rambo-like-action-flick, except with great acting, cinematography, etc, etc, yadda, yadda, yadda, but still - you'd have to be quite dumb to believe what's happening on the screen.All in all, a good watch, just close your eyes or squint hard once the final battle begins (you'll know), but if half the stuff mentioned in the trivia section is true (about actors pulling their teeth / self inflicting wounds, etc, to get into character more), then let me just say - the final result is not worth it. This one is not for the ages.Giving this an 8. I was inclined to give less for the whole bundle, but, to hell with it, some of the acting / directing in some scenes is so good it's worth it.","

"Islandoutfitter1","22 May 2017","Having read all of Stephen Ambrose, I recall one hedgerow story in which the Germans fought SO badly and lost so many soldiers that the Americans felt bad for them. The Germans walked right into an entrenched American force who mowed them down left and right with very little loss of American life. Stuff like this happens in war. Late in the war there would not have been ""crack"" German forces left to defend Germany. All these complaints about how badly the Germans fought are not that unrealistic. But, yes, there were a lot cliché scenes and characters in this movie.","

"Troy-Tempest","16 January 2015","If you don't know anything about the war, it was a great movie. However, where does Troy start? How about with the opening credits! According to them, Hitler didn't declare total war until April 1945, not in Feb 1943. Credit for showing the personalised detail of the tank, inside and out, where each crew stows gear etc differently from other crews. Well done there! However, on the inside there is a collection of medals that have been taken as trophies. Fair enough you'd think. Except there is a Mothers Cross as well! As if any mum would be walking around Germany in late '44 or'45 actually wearing her Mothers Cross! Even if by some chance there was such a mother, are we to believe Brad would strip it off the body of a (presumably) dead women as a trophy? From memory there was also an EK2 on ribbon in the tank, they weren't worn with the ribbon attached, so where did he find that Troy wonders? These are very simple things to research, blunders like this do not and should not happen. The deplorable scene with not one, but two German anti-tank guns failing to hit Shermans from 100 metres, maybe with school boys firing them but not with experienced artillery crews, those Shermans would have been toast. Then there is the scene where the Sherman comes into a town, without clearing the houses out with infantry first. What is stopping some of the sneaky Germans who are hiding up in the houses from blasting the Sherman with a Panzerfaust? Nothing! Except apparently, even though it's April 1945, and there were a gazillion made, well, only over six million, these guys didn't have any? So they attack the tank with a machine gun - d'uh! Then there is the atrocity when the 75mm anti-tank shell BOUNCES OFF the Sherman from 30 metres range! It would have gone straight through not bounced off. Now we get to the disgraceful Tiger tank scene. A Tiger could knock out a Sherman from well over 1100 metres away, so what does the dumbest Tiger commander in the Heer/Waffen-SS do? He misses with his first shot from 700 metres away, then proceeds to drive forward and engage five Shermans from way closer than he ever needed to do. While he does knock out four of the five, he ends up engaging Brad Pitt from FIVE METRES away! Naturally, dumbkopf lets Brad get behind him and gets knocked out. A travesty if ever there was one, he could have just stayed 800 metres away and knocked out all five Shermans. Oh, Troy forgot the pointless (and war crime indictable) exercise when Brad makes the new guy shoot a German prisoner in the back just to toughen him up. Now, the horrendous and totally ludicrous end scene. Fury hits a mine and blows off a track. Whilst being repaired, they become aware of 200-300 crack Waffen-SS men, armed with MG42's by the score, and Panzerfausts, marching and singing towards the disabled Fury. They're looking for trouble! Brad says he's staying, and then the others stay too for the final showdown. Did Troy mention the Waffen-SS had shouldered Panzerfausts? Brad has this ingenious plan to pass the Sherman off for a knocked out tank, while the five valiant US tankers hide inside. When the hundreds of Waffen-SS stroll into view, and a couple of them climb up onto Fury to check it out, when they open the (unlocked) hatches, they are quickly shot and then it begins! Did Troy mention they were carrying Panzerfausts? They start getting mown down left, right and centre by the Sherman's machine guns, not to mention the main gun taking out scores of evil Nazis who are just running around in a panic, instead of reacting like well-trained men who have years of Eastern Front experience. Literally a hundred must have been shot! FINALLY someone remembers they have some Panzerfausts! Someone brings over a BOX containing four of them, what the hell happened to all of the ones that were being carried only minutes earlier? From point blank range, one misses! And another! At last someone scores a hit, and all it does is kill one guy inside the tank! It would have TOTALLY destroyed it from 3 metres! Not Fury! On and on it goes with SS guys getting killed like flies, until Fury runs low on ammo. The commanding officer rallies his remaining SS troopers with a sterling speech, then walks in the opposite direction while his men charge off! He'd be leading from the front! Finally it's down to Brad and the new guy. Brad jumps out and starts hosing even more SS with the .50 cal on the outside of the tank. A sneaky SS sniper is crawling towards Fury, and fires...only to wing Brad! And he's only 30 metres away! He fires again...and only another flesh wound! He fires a third time...this one hurts! Brad slumps back into Fury, then a couple of stick grenades get lobbed through the still unlocked hatch, but these ones don't have the regular four second fuse, not for Brad! Brad has time to order the new guy out through the bottom hatch and as he's crawling away, they explode. Satisfied that everyone is dead, the SS come to order and start to march off. THEN one SS guy decides to look under Fury,and sees the new guy still alive. Now bear in mind he's just seen hundreds of his kameraden killed, so what does he do? Looks at him then walks off! WTF!?! The only good thing in the movie was that Brad was toting an StG44! No stars! 15 mins · Like","

"Stephen_BU","14 November 2014","I loved this movie for it's different portrayal of WWII from the view of the 2nd armored division. This was the first WWII movie I have seen were the majority of the action sequences take place from inside a tank. The action sequences were intense, and this movie is very dark and violent. The violence is pretty intense, but I feel that it is necessary to tell the story of how crappy (huge understatement) these young men had it in WWII. I very much enjoyed this film and will be purchasing it when it comes out on blu ray.SIDE NOTE: I was very surprised to see the amount of 2-3 star ratings that this movie had in it's review section towards the top. I feel that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but if you are going to rip this movie, have a good reason. The only criticism I see from this movie is that it's cliché... I swear.. every other negative review on this site says that something's cliché... THAT'S Cliché!","

"gradyharp","31 January 2015","'Ideals are peaceful. History is violent.' David Ayer (Training Day, The Fast and the Furious, End of Watch, Harsh Times, S.W.A.T, Sabotage etc) wrote and directed this film that explores aspects of WW II – and all war, in fact. It is intensely brutal, unforgivingly bitter, and graphically assaulting – just like war. It is one of the better film s to capture the way war alters soldiers and the citizens of the country who are not involved. It is painful to watch: it is important to note.April, 1945. As the Allies make their final push in the European Theatre, a battle-hardened Army sergeant named Wardaddy Brad Pitt) commands a Sherman tank and his five-man crew – Bible Swan (Shia LaBeouf), Gordo Garcia (Michael Peña), Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal) and the very young 8 week in the Army typist Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. Outnumbered, out-gunned, and with a rookie soldier thrust into their platoon, Wardaddy and his men face overwhelming odds in their heroic attempts to strike at the heart of Nazi Germany. There are a few moments when battle is not active that are memorable – the episode where Wardaddy and Norman have lunch and more in the home of two frightened German women, the confrontation of Wardaddy with Norman bringing him into the realm of being a killing soldier, etc – but for the most part the film is constant fighting, grizzly unspeakably horrid, insane, sociopathic but true to war mentality fighting.The cast is excellent – if only the adopted varying accents would allow us to understand all the lines – and kudos to Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Michael Peña, Shia LaBeouf, Jon Bernthal, Jason Isaacs, Alicia von Rittberg, Anamaria Marina. The musical score by Steven Price is superb and the cinematography by Roman Vasyanov is incredibly realistic. The film is very long – just like prolonged battles in war – and the end result is a crushing question of why do we continue to participate in such wastes of lives.","

"searchanddestroy-1","22 October 2014","Blood, guts, tripes, death. Here are the key words to describe this absolute masterpiece. The true face of war. Far ahead before PRIVATE RYAN. And also a tank movie as were BEAST OF WAR, in 88, and STEEL LADY, back in the fifties. Brad Pitt is here so poignant, so terrific and Shaia Le Buf has never been so good in a supporting character. The 135 minutes are not so long for the audience. And above all, SS troops are not shown as jerks. SS were butchers, assassins, beasts, yes, yes, yes, but certainly NOT jerks. The behaviour of one of them, at the end, is surprising and why not unbelievable. But why not? One last thing, the final battle begins in broad daylight and ends at night...But, again, why not?","

Suffice to say Fury would not make my top 10 war movies list, and it beats me that it has a higher score than movies such as Cross of Iron. Well just my opinion of course!

"moviexclusive","21 October 2014","War isn't pretty. Nor does it kill discriminately. Hollywood woke up to that reality with Steven Spielberg's ground-breaking masterpiece 'Saving Private Ryan' slightly more than 15 years ago, and hasn't looked back since. Set within the same great conflict in modern twentieth century history, David Ayer's 'Fury' possesses the exact same sensibilities. It is gritty and realistic, bloody and brutal, grim and sobering; to put it simply, it's that kind of war movie which doesn't paint its subject any differently from what it is in real life, and it does so with such persuasion that it deserves to be mentioned among the very best.To be sure, Ayer's propensity for raw authentic portrayals of masculine behaviour under fire wasn't born and bred on this battlefield. Indeed, his preoccupation began on the streets of South Central Los Angeles, which formed the setting for his 'Training Day' script which won Denzel Washington an Oscar as well as equally well- received LAPD drama 'End of Watch' two years ago. But Ayer truly comes into his own as a filmmaker with his latest, an apparent work in progress for many years during which he did the research on every little meticulous detail that shows on the screen – most prominently with the use of five M4 Sherman tanks and one German tiger in the production.While it takes its title from the sobriquet of a particular Sherman tank with the four-letter word emblazoned across its barrel, 'Fury' is less about what happens outside the tank than inside the battered vehicle. Within those walls are five men led by Sgt. Don Collier, a.k.a. Wardaddy (Brad Pitt), a battle-hardened commander who has been fighting Germans through Africa, Belgium, the Netherlands and now on their very home soil. His crew includes gunner Boyd ""Bible"" Swan (Shia LaBeouf), a religious man who prays over the Germans he kills; Boyd's loader Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis (Jon Bernthal), a short-fused belligerent hillbilly who is the most unhinged of the lot; and driver Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia (Michael Peña), the sole Mexican-American among them.In a broad sense, 'Fury' does share some similarity with 'Training Day' – both films unfold from the point of view of a rookie; in the case of the former, a young recruit named Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman), sent to replace the tank's fifth crew member, the assistant driver, who has just been killed. Barely eight weeks in the Army and trained as a clerk typist, Norman simply doesn't belong. Ayer uses Norman as the audience's surrogate, plunged into the horrific necessities of war and forced to put aside conventional notions of decency and humanity in order to survive.""Ideals are peaceful; history is violent,"" Wardaddy explains to Norman when they get a brief respite in a German town which they liberate from the scourge of the Nazis. An interlude in the middle of the film that sees the two men chancing upon two German women in an apartment, the fortyish Irma (Anamaria Marinca) and her beautiful young cousin, Emma (Alicia von Rittberg) makes that point emphatically, the eventual denouement of the latter marking one of the most unexpectedly moving turning points in the movie. Ayer's commitment to character is evident in this sequence alone, and he remains steadfast to it from start to finish. Though the characters read like archetypes for the genre, they are surprisingly well drawn. Each has developed his own defence as a response to cope with the horrors he witnesses, and Ayer captures their buried feelings with shrill immediacy. Their roles in relation to each other in the team are also clearly defined, and their camaraderie is made up of a rough and unpretentious intimacy. Yet what proves to be far more fascinating is the complex dynamic between Wardaddy and his men, the former assuming the role of the latter's paterfamilias as he watches over the latter with a keen eye not dulled by his combat weariness. In many ways, Ayer fashions this as an old-fashioned platoon movie inflected by a post 9/11, post- Iraq, post-Afghanistan, 21st century point of view, such that despite its familiarity, it subverts and enhances old-school expectations with contemporary sensibilities and comes across both fresh and gripping.The same can be said of star Brad Pitt's riveting performance, which is no doubt one of his very best. Though one may be tempted to compare it with that in 'Inglorious Basterds', Pitt loses the hipster jokiness of the former film for a much more grounded and compelling portrayal of the tough and quiet squad leader filled with intensity and charisma. His below-the-line team is exceptional, including a truly excellent LaBeouf, an edgy Bernthal and a quietly solid Pena. But the film is also anchored on the other end by Lerman, his horror and disgust a cracked mirror for the crew as well as a proxy for the audience, and the actor best known for playing the lead in 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is heartfelt to the point of being almost heart- breaking.The fact that it resonates so immensely with us is testament to the power of this bleak and savage portrait of war. It is not about the honor, glory or majesty of heroes; no, it is simply about a fight for survival premised on the shedding of blood - heads are vaporized by mortar rounds; limbs are severed by bursts of automatic-rifle fire; and human flesh is charred by flames and shredded by shrapnel. Even so, it is a deeply sensitive exploration of the depths of hell in battle, shot with visceral and often shockingly grisly realism and driven by a top-notch calibre of actors you want to hear mentioned when awards season comes along. And when it's time to write the history of Hollywood's war movies, we're sure 'Fury' will be mentioned among the very best.","

"ThomasDrufke","2 February 2015","Even though Fury is not based off of any source material, it had it's moment of reality mixed in with many far-fetched moments. It's a highly entertaining World War II drama that although can be exaggerated, turned out to be a very solid film. The cover presents a quote that it's the best war film since Saving Private Ryan and Platoon. That's a lot to live up to, especially in an age where we feel like we have seen all types of war films. Fury takes a different approach to the genre. It follows a crew of men who strictly work in tanks. Not only do you get a feel for the comradery that exists between soldiers, but you get a sense of the extreme conditions and hardships these men went through on a day to day basis.The acting is really solid across the board. Brad Pitt is great as usual, but the real praise goes to Logan Lerman and Shia LaBeouf. These young actors surprisingly hold their own next to Pitt, Pena, and Bernthal. I was really impressed with David Ayer's script, especially the scenes involving the whole crew in the tank. There are moments of weakness though. Including some inconsistencies with Pitt's character, Wardaddy. At times he is completely against killing women and children, the next he is yelling at Lerman for sparing the lives of Nazi children. Or even the fact that it doesn't make much sense why Lerman was put into this situation in the first place. It was just mentioned as a 'mistake'. There is also a lack of female characters, besides one elongated dinner scene. It makes me wonder about Ayer's writing for Suicide Squad. Especially as DC's most famous female super-villain, Harley Quinn, is in his hands.The production design looks great. The filmmakers really give you a feel of what Germany looked and felt like in the 1940's. With that being said, for some reason the bullets special effects really bothered me. They looked green and red at times, reminding me of a Star Wars film. It's a small complaint that is likely nitpicking, but if it's noticeable it's worth mentioning. Steven Price's score is noticeably his style, which worked both for and against him. His score went from being awkwardly unfit for WWII, to being emotionally powerful. But this all leads to the terrific finale. If you didn't care for the first 3/4 of the film, they make a point for you to care about the ending. Once again, a few far-fetched moments don't go unnoticed, but it's still an enjoyable film.+Lerman & LeBeouf +Production design +Ayer's script +Finale -Character inconsistencies -Special effects iffy 7.1/10","

It's gritty, bleak and probably one of the more realistic depictions of the loss of humanity towards the end of a long and particularly vicious war. Anyone who doesn't see the strong realism in the amoral and violent behaviour standards of Wardaddy and his crew has obviously never spent time with returned service personnel from that era, listening to their stories of what they experienced and observed. The final battle is the most obviously Hollywood-influenced section of the movie, the rest is as good and as gripping as I've ever seen. Heroic? No. Triumphant? No. Worth watching? Absolutely!","

"TheMarwood","31 December 2014","After the incredibly stupid and incompetent film Sabotage, David Ayer returns to screens only a few months later with the well crafted Fury. It's a major return to form for Ayer and this grim, gory tale of a small crew commanding a tank during the end of WWII is a worthy submission to the genre. For about the first hour, the film is all business, a relentless onslaught of one gruesome situation after another and the heavy toll it's taken on our leads. The film stumbles a bit when things quiet down for an extended sequence in a German civilian home, where getting a cooked meal turns into a difficult time, when civility is absent from most of the crew. It felt like it was inspired from the French plantation sequence that was reinstated in Apocalypse Now Redux - but the story in Fury is just too lean and small in scope to withstand a narrative detour like that. The cast is uniformly excellent, with the exception of Jon Bernthal who overplays his role as a broad cliché, who never feels human. Fury doesn't quite pull off the ending, but there's enough quality filmmaking throughout to recommend the film.","

"ethanbresnett","22 December 2020","In my experience there are two types of war films. Those that blindly cover our protagonists in glory and display hubristic levels patriotism and self righteousness. Then there are those that lay bare the horrors of war in an uncompromising way, casting a grey shadow over the morality of war and the actions of those involved.Fury falls into the latter category, presenting a much more emotional, powerful, nuanced, and nihilistic view of war. I liked that the film took this route, as it made for some very engaging and gripping cinema, with a decent layer of emotion beneath the action.This was mostly captured through Logan Lerman's character, who experienced a stark transformation throughout the film. He portrayed the character superbly, and I could really relate to his emotion and feeling. The rest of the cast were all fantastic, particularly John Berthnal and Shia LaBeouf. This isn't one of those war films where violence is glorified and the effects of war on the soldiers is ignored. This is explored in a good level of depth and the cast rose to this challenge perfectly.The action was really engrossing, and also uncomfortable to watch at times, which should be the case in a war film. The tank combat was very tense and quite unique, I haven't really seen anything like it in any other war films I've seen. They managed to capture the cramped atmosphere inside the tank brilliantly.Fury is definitely a must for any lovers of WW2 films and war/action films in general. It has solid action, as well as great characterisation, performances, and direction.","

"sealover19","15 October 2018","The movie as a whole is an average war movie that doesn't convey deeper theme or deliver any good thoughts except, ""war is war and you have to kill because it's war."" There are pointless violence and unrealistic battle scenes. If the plot and the story contains something more meaningful to our intelligence, it would be better.The production is fine for me, who doesn't know much military stuff and doesn't know what the real things are like. The performance of all actors and actresses are solid and believable. Each character has its own personality. But the battle scenes seem silly that the American win so easily and the bullets of the German seem to miss the point all the time in every battle scene.But what I dislike the most about the movie is the idea that war means killing and it's good to kill others whom we consider enemies. I don't like movies that support war and portray killing mass of people as something great and brave. Some of the characters almost look like they enjoy killing. It just makes me feel sad and resentful. Nevertheless, there is a gentle scene with the two German girls that conveys humanity of some soldier characters. I like the performance of the two girls, expressive without a word spoken. In conclusion, action-movie lovers . patriotic American people, and those who enjoy violence and killing probably like the movies. Peace lovers should stay away.","

"John K.-2","24 October 2014","Fury is intended as a ""horrors of war"" film in the same way that Saving Private Ryan was, and there are perhaps too many scenes of deeply unpleasant injuries and deaths. However, it has two key strengths. One is the tank battle scenes, which I have not seen done so effectively before. The other is realism; it includes vignettes on the enormous psychological resistance to killing another human being; whether there are atheists in foxholes; and incongruous moments of humanity. It does include some war film clichés; there's a transformation from ""boy"" into ""soldier man""; the usual ""band of brothers"" stuff; and the Americans are not nice, but the Germans are nastier (though sadly, this reflects the reality of spring 1945 pretty well). There are also a few ""but why didn't they just ..."" moments in the plot. It won't become that classic that Private Ryan is -- Private Ryan earned that status by being the first ""real war violence"" film and also having a journey as its core plot -- but it's well worth the night out, as long as you have the stomach for the bloody bits.","

"capone666","20 January 2015","Fury With their long cannon shafts, tanks are widely considered the penises of the battlefield.That's why the armoured vehicle in this action movie is crammed full of testosterone.In the heart of occupied Germany, Sgt. Collier (Brad Pitt) and his armored tank division (Shia LaBeouf, Jason Isaacs, Michael Peña, Jon Bernthal) receive a green replacement, Norman (Logan Lerman), for their deceased gunner.Inexperienced in both war and women, Norman's new roommates give him a crash course as they push further inland.But when a landmine downs their Sherman, the stubborn Sergeant refuses to abandon the tank, even with three hundred Nazis marching directly towards them.A candid and unapologetic portrayal of life inside of a metal beast, Fury's manly cast and machine-gun machismo works alongside its cruelty and pathos to deliver a flawed but unforgettable experience.Incidentally, it's rare to see this many dudes living together without a Foosball table.

"macub8","26 October 2014","Having not seen a top level war film for some time this looked like it had all the elements to be one of the greats about the WW2 conflict No films have been made to portray the life of a tanker either German or Allied ,and being a fan of Das Boot ""The Boat"" I thought yes lets go and see this in the cinema.This would benefit from the larger screen and sound effects that these films need,remember ""Saving Private Ryan"" My thoughts post viewing were mixed .I think you have to try and see what the director is trying to portray and get away from the obvious entertainment value of the film .It is quite deep .A young Rookie is thrust into a battle hardened crew of tank crewmen slowly becoming removed from civilised values in order to survive the day to day skirmishes against equally brutal and fanatical resistance As time goes by you see him trying to fit in to this impossible situation ,he has as he finds out no choice but to change or die He has to change to keep his team to survive Along the way he brings out the humanity and emotions in his teammates such is the strength of his character and you see the bonding process evolve that is needed to operate as a ""single unit"" capable of effective action I am writing this a day after watching the film and feel that this has been thoughtfully made ,dares to be different and has some excellent acting but the relationship between Norman ""Logan Lerman"" and ""War Daddy"" Brad Pitt who has a lot of facets to his character as elder and mentor is very convincing . Forgive the sometimes unbelievable but great action scenes I liked it and will be recommending it","

"shawneofthedead","27 October 2014","War is nasty business, and David Ayer has no intention of making it any less so in Fury, his bruising, dark and very violent World War Two drama. It's easy to be caught up in the fast, furious action of it: Ayer liberally peppers the film with explosions and gore. But that's not all there is to the film. While Ayer does lose track of it at a few points along the way, Fury, at its best, digs into some bitter and very hard truths about the sacrifice and loss - of blood, of life, of innocence - that must accompany a war, even one fought for a genuinely good cause.The action and the narrative revolve around 'Fury', a five-man tank commandeered by Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt). He's promised the men who serve with him - Bible (Shia LaBeouf), Gordo (Michael Pena) and Grady (Jon Bernthal) - to get them through the war alive. When they complete a mission that took out the rest of the platoon of tanks, the men meet their new assistant driver: Norman (Logan Lerman), a sweet young man who trained as a clerk and is painfully ill-suited for the rigours and demands of battle. Nonetheless, they are forced to become a unit and, finally, a team, as Fury trundles across Germany to free trapped American soldiers, capture towns, and cut off a battalion of top-notch SS soldiers.Fury can be roughly divided into three acts, the first of which is easily the best and most thought-provoking. Many war movies set during World War Two are infused with at least a hint of nostalgia and romance - it's what naturally accompanies the notion that the Allies are fighting to free the world from the uncomplicated evil of Nazi Germany.But Fury resolutely refuses to take that route. This is a film that stares the cold, hard nature of war in the face, and highlights the callous way in which it strips morality and innocence even from men who, as history tells us, are fighting on the right side. As the titular tank makes its way back to camp and out again, it becomes clear that the Allied soldiers are beaten and worn down by battle, their bodies and spirits caked in mud, blood and cynicism. The tanks roll over the corpses of the dead, pressing them - forgotten and lost - into the welcoming ground. It's a startlingly bleak picture to paint of the realities of the situation, one which highlights to an almost unbearable degree the monsters that are made in war: of men who have had to get used to killing nameless others as long as they're on the other side.Less successful is the film's strange second act, set in a hollowed-out town 'freed' by the Americans. With Norman in tow, Don enters the apartment of an understandably edgy German woman, where the two find hot water, food and other bodily comforts. Shorn of the gory violence of the rest of the film, this segment feels strangely stagey: the characters are trapped in the oddest of situations, soldiers and civilians, enemies or friends, sat awkwardly around a dining table or in the bedroom. There are moments of almost heartbreaking insight: Don peeling off his shirt to reveal the wounds of battles past, or opening a box in which he's carefully stored precious items for a moment just like this one. But it also feels rushed and a bit silly, as Norman grows up off the battlefield and their fellow tank-mates turn up for some uncomfortably confrontational moments that should but don't quite pass for character development.Ayer devotes the final act to a bloody, bitter battle, fought from within and around the tank in a bid to prevent SS soldiers from clashing with the Allied forces. It's a powerful climax, crammed full of incident and devastation, as each member of this ragged, raw team - a dysfunctional family, with Wardaddy as the patriarch - chooses whether to fight, and then must decide how they want to die. It manages to be rousing and repelling all at once, as bullets fly and grenades stir up mist and blood that paints itself across the tank. Indeed, Ayer makes it almost exhausting to watch, especially when the sequence goes on and on for just a little too long.The cast is uniformly excellent. Pitt leads the charge with an electric performance, one that makes it possible to believe the hell Don has gone through to ensure his tank-mates can live. In a moment when he shrinks to the ground, tears shuddering out of him before he reins it all in again, you get a clear picture of the scars this man bears that can't be seen. Lerman again proves that he's a great actor outside of the Percy Jackson franchise, with a quite devastating array of shell-shocked reactions to the horrors Norman is forced to witness and commit. LaBeouf contributes unexpected gravitas in a tricky role but makes his character's constant reference to scripture something complex instead of potentially frustrating. Pena and Bernthal have less to do, but they both convince with the depth of their respective amiability and hostility towards Norman. In Bernthal's character, especially, it's possible to see that men who are not themselves strictly 'good' can fight for good causes too.Is Fury one of the great war movies? Probably not. On occasion, it approaches magnificence in its depiction of the wear and tear of war - even for the eventual victors of the conflict. But, for every spine-chilling insight it provides into the monsters made of men in the heat of battle, the film also wanders off in odd directions - particularly in a middle section that feels deeply out of place and hugely rushed. That makes for rewarding, challenging but also frustrating viewing.","

"joeyajames-555-640684","17 May 2015","If you dislike war movies you won't like Fury because like most war movies, it is full of shooting and blood and death. Fury, provides a far better close-up view of the challenges of a WW2 tank commander and his team than any other film I've seen. This historical insight is what I liked best about Fury. Like Saving Private Ryan, it masterfully depicts the diverse personalities of the team and how they interact. There is plenty of action and suspense. But there is also a fair bit of drama and tension between the characters. The film has no shortage of acting talent. Brad Pitt does an excellent job (though I think his performance in Basterds was better). Fortunately the film doesn't rely entirely on Pitt to carry it -- a few other members of his tank crew also give notable performances (my favorites were Bernthal and Pena). Many people have argued about the realism of a few Shermans beating a Tiger. I don't know how likely that is, but that scene definitely showed us how out-matched the Shermans were by the Tigers. Also many have complained about the final fight scene, which was totally unrealistic, but what we're supposed to get from it is that our heroes could have walked away and they chose to stay and fight knowing they had no chance. I enjoyed it and will probably watch it again.","

"Dragonsouls","3 March 2015","I liked the film for the most part. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. I felt as if the movie needed some more philosophy in it, and more social commentary. Instead, we got more explosions instead.Speaking of the fireworks, David Ayer really knows how to put on a show. This film was a high octane spectacle, and it was beautifully shot, but Ayer is probably a better director than he is a writer. I would hate to call this film mindless, but it was close. Some of the gore in this film was over the top too.Fury is a decent depiction of tank warfare and features some interesting characters with psychological conflicts. However, the only reason I would play this film again is to show off my home theater system.","

"mm-39","23 October 2014","I went into the theater wondering if Fury would be just another war movie. Been there done that. Fury is well acted, written, and directed. The character driven story is one of Pitt's strongest performances. The story of an innocent young recruit who is mentored by a harden warrior. As the movie unfolds one sees the human side of Pitt's character tempered with the warrior side(Brad Pitt). The director unfolds the brutality of the human experience, and the reasoning for the butchery. The Waffen S S marching scene creates an essence of the spirit and fanaticism of the enemy. One understands after seeing the enemy why Pitt's character goes on the suicide mission. Compassion/responsibility drives Pitt's character to fight so others may live. A powerful ending where a young S S soldier shows his human side gave the movie hope in a world of brutality. Fury is an eight star movie.","

"leonblackwood","1 March 2015","Review: What an epic movie! I couldn't help feeling emotional during the big shootout at the end and I felt for the crew who only had the tank to protect them from the many Germans who were attacking them with ultimate force. The director done extremely well by making the film look and feel realistic and you really feel like your in the tank with the crew. All of the actors put in great performances, especially Brad Pitt who was the head of his 5 man crew. I would have liked the director to go in depth with the individual characters except for concentrating on the new comer to the group, but thats just me being picky. I also thought that it could have done with some more scenes with them away from the front line because it does jump straight in at the deep end, right from the beginning. Anyway, the storyline is quite basic but interesting throughout and I really couldn't imagine how it must have felt to be in such a soul crushing situation. They only had each other to pull through combat and tackle the tricky a Germans so it was important that the director got the chemistry right with the actors, which he done very well. Its basically what it says on the tin and what we expect from a big budget Brad Pitt movie but I must admit, the bonding and brotherhood of the tank crew did touch me. Enjoyable!Round-Up: You can really see were every penny of this budget went in this movie and I'm surprised that it didn't cost more. The many explosions and attention to detail made it seem like you was right there with the soldiers, who I have to give recognition to. On the bonus parts of the DVD, you get to see the actors talking to the real tank crew of that period so it shows how in depth the actors went to get there characters right. Brad Pitt isn't one to take on any and every role, so he only really comes out of the woodwork when the script is totally perfect. In this case, I can see why he took on the role as ""Wardaddy"" and his professionalism and humble way of acting, really worked with this character. At the beginning, I was cursing Logan Lerman who plays Norman, because it seems like he really won't fit in with tight crew, but as time goes on and with Pitt's guidance, he bonds with the team and he becomes one of there family. The scenes in the house with the girls showed a different side to the characters but when they went back to battle, it was quickly forgotten and straight back to business as normal. Anyway, the ending was a bit predictable but I did enjoy the film!Budget: $68million Worldwide Gross: $212millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their war movies about a tank crew who have to fight against the Germans under extreme circumstances. 7/10","

"limoko","26 January 2020","This move is utterly complete trash and was billed as something it is not. In the wake of the mini series Band of Brothers and The Pacific the production of this movie with current technology should have been a knock out. With actual running / working tanks and the amount of first hand reports and after actions reports , not to mention battle field tactics , access to ooddles of replica props , this entire story line is absolute garbage. I have studied ww2 from both side weapons and tactics not to mention behavior and trainging that soldiers receive to function and survive in combat...THIS IS NOT AN ACTUAL REPRESENTATION OF HOW battlefield tactics are implemented... so much of what actually happened during this time period of the European theater is documented and the writers and producer vomited a steaming pile cocktail wieners ... the only thing you can do is fast forward to the action to watch the cgi and pricnciple photography blended together to present a facsimile for what a scrimish kinda looked like...","

"spencejoshua-22736","10 July 2020","I think this statement made by Wardaddy sums up the purpose of the film. It's about the violence of the battlefield. Some of the events of the film are based on true accounts from WWII veterans. . Granted, all these events have been pushed together into a single storyline. Still, we get to see the ugliness of war from the perspective of tankers, which is one that hasn't been explored in a lot of depth in very many military films. It was interesting watching soldiers cope and interact with one another in an environment of carnage and despair. For the most part I was impressed with the course of the film. I'd watch it again!","

"chaos-rampant","9 March 2015","This is another of those war movies where existentialism becomes about desperate men traipsing through a blasted landscape strewn with debris and mangled shapes of a life that failed to make sense and provide order that prevents it.Existentialism originally comes from studies on the logic of perception but somewhere along the way it has come to mean, in lay terms and otherwise, laments about how cold and repetitively pointless life can be, with only negative connotations. No matter. This hue came about by minds aghast by a couple of world wars and no real peace after.It is WWII so we can have it all fairly removed from the doublebinds of politics and shrouded in common myth, a necessary struggle against evil but one that mitigates the horror and pain? The soldiers are for most of the film inside tanks so we can have visual imagery of men crawling through that horror in metal hulls that are as much weapon as they are home and self.But the most important thing for me in something like this, is there insight of the urges behind that madness, insight of the rituals that make it up and diffuse it? Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, The Red and the White, Thin Red Line, they all attempt these insights.There is one here, a startling insight as the disheveled crewmembers from the same tank gatecrash rudely a German home where their commander has sought a few moments of refuge away from the carnage and a calm meal cooked by a German mother. In the next room the young greenhorn recruit has just had sex with the beautiful daughter, which underscores something we've been seeing for most of the film and should be the existential focus, that this is a war where good and evil should be on clear sides, but beneath this duality we see life as a parade of games and rituals; the tank battles on a field, the ribbing of the greenhorn recruit by the grizzled veterans, the bartering of sex for safety and a meal.So when their cohorts foul up this moment of quiet, we see a few of those things with some clarity, how it's not some other cruelty that gives rise to war than what we see in that room, their sudden pettiness and vindictiveness, how evil doesn't think of itself as evil and how it's really ego and ignorance. How morality is nothing more than a bunch of agreements we make and decide to uphold and how easy it is to tear up once you are excluded from the benefits.So this is more or less fine, some flaws of formulaic style rather than observation. But the end is where it completely loses me.We have rituals throughout the film, and in the end we have the most momentous one that decides life and death for these people but now it becomes a defiant stand of the brave few against the many, mawkish and reductive when this is the climax to a WWII movie but without any insight either. Of course it plays long enough for us to see a last German soldier keeping silent, sparing a pointless death, and this too a part of gamesmanship.","

"targe1314","9 February 2015","I had high expectations watching this movie, as I am a huge WWII tank buff and love the late model Shermans.Sadly, this movie was over the top and completely ridiculous, even more so than Saving Private Ryan, which until now was my worst modern WWII movie.If you don't give a damn about historical accuracy then proceed no further as I have no time for you....If you really want to understand tank combat, in WWII, then proceed further...First, a history lesson. The Americans produced a very successful tank, the Sherman, during WWII. It was very easy to build, very easy to drive and fire, and they pumped them out like sausages.The Germans, they went the other direction, starting in mid-WWII, they began producing very sophisticated tanks, including the Tiger I, the Panther, and late war, the Tiger II and JadgPanther (tank hunter) tanks. These tanks were very expensive, in very short supply, and the majority of tanks that the American shermans faced in the D-Day landings and beyond were the earlier Panzer-III and IV models. The IV was a basic match for the Sherman.OK, so the movie starts with some random German officer riding his white horse through a battlefield, and getting jumped by a tank commander. this is ludicrous. No German officer would risk his life alone to ride through a recent battlefield. Silly.The tank commander orders his new hull gunner to execute a German prisoner... Completely false and a HUGE insult to our veterans! The tank crew gets drunk and storms the tank commander's party. In WWII, that would have earned you an immediate court martial if they did not leave the room IMMEDIATELY. The tank commander was GOD, and he decided if you were going to be dragged away by the MP's or not.A Tiger Mk 1 charges across an open field to engage 4 Shermans. Crazy. The Tiger was a long distance engager. It would sit back with it's 88mm gun and pick off enemy targets at will. It took an average of 5 sherman tanks, rushing it at FULL SPEED, to take one Tiger out. 4 of the 5 Shermans would NOT SURVIVE. THIS IS WAR, and the Americans knew this, which is why the Sherman crews would bail out as soon as they heard an 88mm shell landing anywhere near them! They knew their country had the advantage in production, and a new tank would be coming soon down the road.On hitting a tank mine... you DO NOT send your crew to check out the local area! You are asking them to be ambushed and trigger further booby traps! Crazy stupid tactics. Any tank commander would leave the sides of the road for the infantry backup.You are a single enemy tank in hostile territory and you find out a company (300+) of enemy infantry is moving on you. What do you do? Well, the easiest answer is you call in artillery and air support and get the hell out of there, on foot if possible.A force this size, especially with anti-tank panzerfaust weapons as portrayed in the movie, is bad news. They will easily surround your tank, overcome the defenses, climb on board if they have to, and chuck grenades and high explosives down your hatches.The tank commander takes 1 or 2 bullets and falls down into the tank and does not immedietely call for medical help.Finally, if you want to watch a decent tank movie, watch ""the beast"", which is about a T-62 tank crew in Afghanistan.Before you reply to this, I am an experienced Canadian Soldier with multiple years of experience...","

"playbobbie13","27 January 2015","This movie, unlike many other war movies, is hard. I say that because it isn't fair, it's hard to watch at times because of it's graphic and moral challenges but above it all, it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is a very emotional roller-coaster as you follow these men aboard Fury as they fight their way through Germany. It would be simple to simply make another ""rah rah"" war movie of us vs. them but this movie reaches deep inside the war to bring fourth the very human aspects and make you deal with it as the viewer. This movie WILL polarize people as they react differently to what they see and I believe that is the point. It further pushes home the old adage of ""War is hell"". I have always wanted to see a more human portrayal of war and I found it in Fury. This goes far further than Saving Private Ryan in that respect. I applaud the guts it took to make this movie.","

"chisoxrock1344","17 October 2014","When I first heard that David Ayer was creating a war film, I was thrilled. I knew he would have that good mix of intimate dialog and intense action that helps audiences fall in love with his characters. This mix was especially prominent in Ayer's End of Watch. I felt Fury barely scratched the surface with these components, leaving me unsatisfied and dry-eyed. In Ayer's defense, this could have been the lack of chemistry or stigma amongst the actors. Shia LaBeouf, for example, has been an absolute douche bag off screen, making it hard to sympathize with his character. And then there's Logan Lerman. That boy should be nowhere near a war film. I get why he was casted, though, for he fit well into his role as Charlie in Perks Of Being A Wallflower. In this film, he played an innocent, passive teenager. And these same qualities were spotted in his role as Norman. But then there was a random point in the film where he was no longer that innocent boy and starts gunning people down like he's Scarface. C'mon. I get that war can turn a boy into a man, which was probably the symbol of Lerman's character, but it just wasn't believable.Ultimately, I didn't feel much of a sense of ""brotherhood"" from Fury. At least not nearly as much as I felt during End of Watch, which was, in my opinion, what made that film so great.","

"magnuslhad","16 March 2015","In the push into Nazi Germany in the closing stages of WWII, a battle-hardened tank crew come up against fanatical opposition. In addition, a rookie soldier is added to their crew and has to be educated in the ways of war. There is grit and rawness here, and the Allies are shown to be capable of brutality, shading the moral tones. The battle scenes are tense and dirty and ring with authenticity. Brad Pitt is magnetic as the leader trying to save his men while keeping as much of a lid on their excesses as possible. The film's flaw is that it shows the men not so much as soldiers, or even heroes, but as supermen, cutting through SS the way Aragorn cuts through Orcs. The ingénue Ellison gets to share a moment with a German civilian who is then conveniently, plot-wise, dispensed with in an air raid, though quite who is bombing who isn't clear. The crude moment seems forced in order to have Ellison be told ""This is war!"" This is a decent if not great film. If they'd made it 50 years ago it would have starred John Wayne.","

I thought it was pretty authentic, very bad things happen in war, men are driven quite mad. I liked the whole thing how they had authentic uniforms, tanks, guns, It was suitably claustrophobic in the tank, realistic in that they were filthy, as there are no showers or pizza huts in the middle of war,and the second world war at the near end was vicious on all sides,prisoners were often summarily executed, some of the scenes in the war, really make me glad i wasn't there.i would recommend this film to anybody who likes old fashioned war films, where you just enjoy the ride.","

"burlesonjesse5","22 October 2014","War is hell. And in the case of 2014's Fury (my latest review), war is sometimes a popcorn flick. In other words, this thing is not gonna wow the Academy nor is it gonna garner any award nominations come January. It is alas, just another battlefield relic, a sort of second tier Saving Private Ryan that also lacks any sort of poetic grandeur from other WWII vehicles such as 1998's The Thin Red Line. Granted, my halfhearted recommendation will stem from it having a few decent performances and a compelling, final thirty minutes involving the protective stand of a broken down Sherman tank. But my bar for scope and sophistication via war movies has always been set very high, and Director David Ayer, who was once in the armed forces himself, unfortunately only raises it a couple of notches here.Edited by Dody Dorn who handled Ayer's last picture in Sabotage, filmed primarily in England, UK (masquerading as East Germany), and having an opening shot that is equal parts scintillating and downright horrific, Fury is an October release that could possibly be labeled as true fact (that's if in the 1940's, killing a defenseless, innocent man wasn't a war crime and head decapitation was how every soldier bit the dust). But come on, does it really matter? As you view it, this dirty, grimy, overcast looking flick is almost plot free in its otherwise two hour-plus running time. What precludes is something minimal about a time during WWII (April of 1945 to be exact), where a five-man tank crew must take on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. They must stop hundreds of German Nazis (who else?) at all cost. So in retrospect, watching Fury made me wonder two things: 1. could what have transpired in this movie succeed more as a sort of documentary shot by an ancient TV crew patiently following a bunch of soldiers around? 2. why is director David Ayer so hellbent on having his characters one up each other, measure each other's manhood (figuratively speaking of course), and having their scenes of conflict being taken way too far (beyond the point of reason)? There's a sequence where these five grubby tankers sit down at a dinner table to eat with two German woman. It's drawn out, cruel, boring, and unnecessary.Regardless, the cast in Fury is for the most part, pretty decent besides the clunky dialogue that they sometimes have to belt out. Sure, they are your typical war stereotypes with lousy attitudes, born to kill instincts, somewhat fake southern accents, and plenty of nasty battle scars. But their acting is way better than in any John Wayne war film (The Green Berets, ugh!) or any John Woo war film (Windtalkers, double ugh!). First off, there's Brad Pitt looking Kelly's Heroes chic in the title role as Sergeant Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier. His character is the leader of the five-man crew and his performance sort of riffs off his Nazi-hating role in Inglorious Basterds. Is it entirely similar? Sort of. But where his Lieutenant Raine in ""Basterds"" was more of a cartoonish impersonation, this is something much deeper. Then we have young Logan Lerman playing effectively, the rookie US Army Private Norman Ellison. He's been a working actor for fourteen years (and he's only 22). Here's hoping this role is a sure-fire breakout one for him. And for the record, his frightened, bewildered military rook reminded me solely of Jeremy Davies as Tim Upham in ""Ryan"". Finally, we have Shia LaBeouf giving Fury its strongest performance. I've always thought of him as being extremely overrated as an actor. But when you put a mustache on him, he totally immerses himself into his role as a bible-thumping Technician 5th Grade. His Boyd Swan is a stultified standout. As for the other two thespians that make it up the gritty five-men crew, well we've got Michael Pena (an Ayer veteran) and Jon Bernthal. Their roles are equal parts token, bigoted, and misogynistic.Performances and direction are key, but when Fury is about to reach its forgone conclusion, the film score actually becomes the main star. It's stirring and it deviates from the pedestrian battle scenes that clearly lack the brilliant technicality of the similar themed (and similar looking) Saving Private Ryan. As mentioned earlier, Fury is sadly, a unintentional popcorn flick rooted in the concept of being non- monumental. It will entertain you like any other vague action film. But the battle sequences depicted (and there are many) are not that compelling. I mean, they are violent but they are laughably rooted in midnight horror fare more than anything else. Case in point: an M4 Sherman tank runs over an already dead corpse and it's the equivalent of a motorcycle squishing a pop can. Also, the outside, facial imprint of a mutilated assistant bow gunner is shown in detail and it would make Hannibal Lecter (or even Nic Cage's Castor Troy from Face/Off) supremely jealous. Anyway, towards the end of Fury's exhausting third act, Pitt's Collier grabs a bottle of liquor, takes a long, slow drink out of it and says, ""that's better than good."" The same can't quite be said about this rollicking grimfest. It's just good enough so I'll roll with a three star rating.","

"ferdinand1932","28 November 2014","Starting well, if slowly, and not very coherently, the look and development is quite good, though much in the wake of Private Ryan, all those years ago.The narrative does the old trick of the new recruit and his immersion in war. The tank crew, tight and loyal, are all there to instill what is required to the new dude. It's not a new presentation; it's not bad and looks very good and the early battle scenes are realistic, in tension and dramatic flow.And then it fails. There is the final cataclysmic battle. Films like this can only go in two ways: either everyone lives or no one does. If no one does they are heroes and that's the formula here. What is quite repulsive is the length of the final battle scene which has an immobilized tank and its crew outwitting hundreds of enemy troops. It turns into mass slaughter as if this is what what heroism is all about but it also deceives the viewer - as all those 1950s and '60s movies did with German soldiers running into a hail of bullets as target practice for the smart US/Allied soldiers.It defies sense, and also the historical record as to how the German troops were led at this time, in their capacity to improvisation and battle tactics, which makes this final scene so completely sickening as a violent fantasy; it undermines the ideal of heroism and how battles are fought in real wars. It plays to the juvenile male spectator who is accustomed to the thrills of software games, not actual battles.In all, it's a Hollywood fraud, worse so because it starts well and with the virtues expected of the material, but leans to the cheap and moronic, and as such, deserves nothing but contempt.","

"lee_eisenberg","9 February 2015","Having battled Nazis comically in ""Inglourious Basterds"", Brad Pitt now does so seriously in ""Fury"". He plays a staff sergeant commanding a Sherman tank through Nazi Germany. This movie shows World War II in its gritty details, although I admit that it probably doesn't compare to being in the midst of a battlefield. One of the most interesting scenes is when the platoon takes the town and spends some time with a pair of German women: it's a brief period of peaceful interaction between presumed enemies, just like the 1914 Christmas truce.It's a really good movie. There are some pretty intense battle scenes, but most importantly, the characters are people whom the audience can care about. In the end, I think that the countries that participated in World War I need to take a serious look at how the Versailles Negotiations precipitated World War II. In addition to the millions of lives senselessly lost in the WWI - not to mention the Armenian Genocide - the Versailles Negotations simply placed new colonizers in Africa and Asia, and destroyed Germany economically, setting the stage for Hitler's rise to power.Anyway, it's a movie that I recommend. Definitely see it.","

"mfellipecampos","7 June 2020","World War II films are almost a subgenre within cinema, and it is no accident. There is a certain facility in them to oppose good guys and bandits, thanks to the humanitarian crimes committed by the Nazis, which are always present in the collective imagination. In Fury, director and screenwriter David Ayer uses this prior information sparingly. As much as the Second World War brings such an environment beforehand, it is in the combat between men and their psychological reflexes that he is most interested. Especially in the horror that war brings.It is not for nothing that the main character of the feature film is Norman (the competent Logan Lerman), a young God-fearing recruit who falls by parachute on the battlefield. Unaccustomed to the bare reality, he feels the thud and, little by little, builds a certain carcass to survive. Fury follows this entire transition period, from naivety to the realization of how hard life is - especially that life. And in this sense, the context of World War II does not matter - it could be any other, without any difficulty. It is the reality of war that is in focus, any where there is hand-to-hand combat between people.Faced with this situation, the director builds Norman's transformation from his tank companions, Brad Pitt's hardened characters, Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pitt and Jon Bernthal. As much as each one has its own peculiarities and distinct needs that often put them in shock, there is also the typical union of those who need support to support all that. Not only on the battlefield, to defeat the enemy, but also on the emotional side. The dynamics of this troop is what is most interesting in the feature film, due to the questions raised from absolutely everyday situations in a war scenario. How would you react to such a situation ?, the viewer may ask himself at various times.To give the air of veracity necessary to this story, David Ayer does not spare the viewer from some strong scenes. The photograph is grayish, a lot of mud on the roads and bodies, blood and body parts here and there. The battles with the tanks give the vibration of the action films, thanks especially to the quality of the sound effects and the ballet of the enemy tanks. There is a commendable technical predicament in the construction of the environments explored along the portrayed journey.I liked this criticism of AdoroCinemaFilm seen on June 6, 2020.","

"mdudmd","25 March 2017","What a poor film. Whilst some of the action was OK it is a shame to see a 21st century WW2 film pedalling the same old inaccuracies. Repeatedy German AT crews could not hit a barn door at 40 paces and apparently logs on the side of a Sherman would stop an 88mm from penetrating. And only an idiot would send unsupported tanks to hold ground and only Hollywood would have German soldiers be unable to stalk armour. What nonsense. And one of the final scenes has a German lift the hatch only to get shot before the pffennig drops and they chucked in a couple of grenades. If you do a war film do it right.","

"manosmitsis","28 March 2020","Well, this seemed to have almost everything in place... Exciting director, star cast, music but the most important element, the script and story plot, was simply not there.If I judge this movie as a war movie and compare it with the genre giants, then Fury fails miserably. We have one-sided views, cliches and hugely unrealistic scenes that formulate Fury a low performer in the war movies genre.On the other hand, if you watch this movie as an purely action movie then what you get is ok, or maybe better than ok. Good action sequences packed with shootings and breathtaking montage, and good acting (well, except for Michael Pena, who is, once again, a caricature of the same character he is portraying in every single movie of his entire career).","

"jadepietro","19 October 2014","This film is highly recommended.Fury is a violent indictment of war and its many casualties. But perhaps, the subtitle should more accurately read: Fury: The Story of a Tank and the Boys who Loved It, since it plays up the band of brothers angle rather vigorously. Or, Fury: The Power and the Gory, since the bloodletting is extremely up close and personal. Either way, the film is a powerful and disturbing drama that evolves into a standard but riveting World War II tale of courage literally under fire. Anyone who has experienced a war film has seen this misfit group before. The stereotypes run deep here as does the clichés they continually lobbed at each other, like word grenades that blow up in their faces: ""Ideals are peaceful. History is violent."" There's the innocent newbie, Norman (Logan Lerman), the Bible-spouting religious zealot, Boyd ""Bible"" Swan (Shia LaBeouf), the brutish bully, Grady (Jon Bernthal), the Latino, Gordo (Michael Pena) and their foolhardy and hardened leader, Wardaddy (Brad Pitt). All of these stock characters are assembled in the confines of a claustrophobic tin can nicknamed Fury. Their mission: stand their ground against the Nazis.For over two hours, the onslaught of Fury is endless, with little character development or back-story to add the slightest bit of enlightenment or empathy. The characters remain under-written facsimiles of the real thing. That said, the ensemble of actors do an exceptional job in trying to flesh out their sketchy characters, especially Shia La Beouf who brings some remarkably subtle acting to his character. However, Pitt's screen persona works against him at the start, seeming too similar to his crazed blood-thirsty character from Inglorious Basterds, a factor that throws the film off kilter at times. But as the film progresses, the actor displays more acting skills, adding a more human side to his tough-as-nails macho man and making his gonzo character more distinctive and believable.Writer/director David Ayer is quite talented, but he is far more interested in war action and its resulting carnage than the human story of its men. The film may accurately depict the brutality of war and the unquestionable bravery of the soldiers placed in these hellish situations, but the movie-going experience is equally as hellish as the war it depicts. While watching Fury, one can easily get battle fatigue from the warfare overkill. With its gruesome images of bloody flesh, exploding heads, and severed human limbs, Fury is not for the faint- hearted or those with a low tolerance for violence. In fact, Fury is violence personified to the max.Ayer has made a grim testament to these men. His visuals are impressive and have an overly realistic edginess, aided greatly by the cinematography by Roman Vasyanov and concise editing by Jay Cassidy and Dody Dorn. Many scenes are beautifully composed and the action sequences are taut and intense. Yet the overall effect appears too manipulative and predictable, even if it is emotionally engaging. The extremely well staged battle scenes resonate the necessary visceral impact that other classic war films like Saving Private Ryan, The Bridge Over the River Kwai, and Platoon have delivered in the past. All in all, Fury is an ugly film, but that statement is meant to be more positive than negative. It unflinchingly shows off the atrocities of war faced by these characters in grisly details. It just doesn't show off its characters with enough details. Still, Fury remains a strong addition to its war genre faction.

"calle_2565","30 October 2014","I haven't seen EVERY war movie ever made, I've seen a lot of them. And just one mans opinion here, but I don't know what to think.The scenery is great, classic world war II scenery (has been done a TON of times). And the story is your typical band of brothers squad, you have your messed up in the head character, your overly religious character, your emotionally scarred leader, a innocent young man and a Mexican (that's about it, his character is just for exposition, handle the gun and saying Spanish words and being ""suave"" with German women. And he is just as messed up about the war as anyone else in the group). This time it is a tank squad, which offer great and intense action scenes. I really like the camera work and the sound during the fights, sometimes they can be a bit overbearing. But hey, that just puts you in the action more. So I don't mind it since I see a purpose for it.The portray of world war II is also basic, you have the weathered soldiers that's fed up with everything and the naive young man that thinks there is a peaceful way out. And I can't say what could've been done instead since this is what you'd expect a war situation to be like. But the problem that I have with it is that it's been done SO many times before. Not breaking any new ground in my humble opinion, but that doesn't make it an unentertaining movie.And who can forget the ever present patriotism and the new wave of film to use musical sounds to make sure that you know what is going on. Seriously, who DOESN'T think that the Nazis are terrible people when you show the people they've hanged for refusing to fight for Germany (or every other thing they did during the war and before that, goes without saying though)? You don't need to use musical sounds to make sure the audience can feel the tension of a scene, war is intense. It doesn't need constant musical accompany, because the imagery is tense as it is. Subtlety would've been the more effective route. Now it just feels like another winners tale of the world war II movie.Also, one last thing. At the end, where one of the squad members is hiding from the Nazis. They should've just shot him, when you build up the Nazis as these ultra bad guys you could at least try something different. That ONE soldier that suddenly gains a conscience, at the END of the movie. Give me a break. Yeah, yeah, the humanity and not everyone is bad thing. But the guy KILLED hundreds of your army friends, and you're just gonna let him go? Yeah right...Watch it for the cool action, camera work and sounds. But it's not groundbreaking, and definitely not 8/10.","

Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for underdog stories.Or maybe, just maybe it was an incredibly awesome film.I don't usually go for hyperbole when discussing films. I'll leave that for others. But Fury, as far as I'm concerned, had it all; a great story, totally believable characters, awesome acting, realistic battle scenes, beautiful photography - all in a film which shows both the horrors of war, as well as the heroism it often reveals.Overall, a brilliant film.

"begob","3 January 2015","Heroic tale of valour in the face of huge odds.The battle scenes in this are great, and the final conflict is legendary. As usual the enemy runs into bullets, while bullets run away from the hero, but it did have an emotional kick.There is moral ambiguity, so it avoids the boredom of goodies v baddies. But the scene in an apartment with a mother and daughter, intended to intensify the characters, doesn't work.Tracer bullets are amazing on screen, but not a single frame of this equals the cow scene in Come And See. The score is full of strong choral stuff, so it gives an epic feel.Overall this needed less of the morals, especially the bible riffs, and more lunacy. I don't think Brad Pitt does lunacy.","

"j-madej","26 October 2014","Apparently the first thing you being taught in the army when you are send on to the battlefield is that you have to accept that one day you will die. It can be 60 years from now or if that is your destiny it will be today in the chaos of war. If you except that then the fear of dying turns to adrenaline that actually helps you to survive. We could go further with this train of thought and fall back on Gnostic philosophy of existence where we are considered spark of divinity, soul- light that is trapped in this sinful world of matter only to return into the source where our soul comes from. The reason why women in most religious traditions are treated as the negative principal of creation is because your mothers womb is in reality your tomb. The second you are starting your materialistic sinful carnation in the world of matter, in reality it is beginning of your death as your cells are dying on a daily basis and are reborn once again. Coming back to the review it definitely takes special kind of a man to become a soldier. The horrors of war that most soldiers go through are unimaginable for most people. This is why successful war movies are so scares and majority of time the balance between the drama, character development and the plot needs to be achieved to make sure that the mainstream audience will be able to empathize with the characters and the story. Majority of time in war movies you have a cinema full of male viewers. It rarely happens that the audience is evenly divided between women and men. This is what the presence of Brat Pitt does to the success at the box office. Writer-director David Ayer created truly something very special in his newest WWII drama ""FURY"" which might be early contender to the next year Oscar race for the best movie. Yes indeed! He is also responsible for writing hit movies like ""Training Day"", ""U-571"", ""The Fast and the Furious"" and directed in the past very solid but far from perfect movies like ""End of Watch"" and ""Harsh Times"". In ""FURY' he accomplishes possibly his best and most technically difficult movie so far mainly with a development of characters where plot became secondary to the realistic depiction of carnage of war. This film offers the viewer a claustrophobic experience of being one of the crew members of US tank under the leadership of Don 'Wardaddy' Collier played valiantly by excellent Brat Pitt.""April, 1945. As the Allies make their final push in the European Theatre, a battle-hardened army sergeant named Wardaddy commands a Sherman tank and her five-man crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. Out-numbered, out-gunned, and with a rookie soldier thrust into their platoon, Wardaddy and his men face overwhelming odds in their heroic attempts to strike at the heart of Nazi Germany.""The whole movie despite of lacking a clear plot line and in essence is just three battlefield scenes that showcase the deterioration of our characters and their moral values testing them as human beings who try to survive at all cost. The war creates monsters on both sides and is a clear test of who our characters are inside. Are they moral people or just animals that in heat of the battle forget about their humanity and compassion. The acting is superb from all the principles. Brat Pitt delivers one of his better performances as brave tank commander who tries to make sure that his crew will get through the horrors of war in one piece. Shia LaBeouf goes method in his performance and apparently refused to take showers during the full time of filming as well he pulled his lower tooth to get in to character of companioned religious Boyd 'Bible' Swan who becomes the moral barometer of the crew developing almost love like admiration towards his commanding officer. Then Jon Bernthal and Michael Peña offer wonderful rich support to the lead actors with Logan Lerman playing a rookie that joins the crew. In some way we observe the horror of war through his eyes and the director is hinting that in some way Pitt's character sees himself in this young intelligent man that has a compassion towards his enemy. The battlefield scenes are realistic in it's violence and often leave us speechless feeling like we are in the middle of actual combat. Movies like ""Das Boot"" and ""U-571"" come to mind where the claustrophobic feeling of being stuck in the metal tin can that stands between them and the enemy enhances the actual cinematic experience. Being 134 minutes long as the audience we are truly engaged into this character driven story that has a potential to not be overlooked in next years Oscar race. Very good film full of wonderful acting performances even if the plot of the story has got something to be desired.For more of my movie reviews go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique","

"jonruff108","8 November 2014","From a technical standpoint, this movie is a masterpiece. The acting (Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Shia LaBeouf, Jon Bernthal) directing (David Ayer), soundtrack (Gravity's Steven Price), sound design, editing, cinematography, and visual and special effects are all some of best you'll see and hear all year. Where this movie falls short is in its pacing, storytelling, and characters. This is a war movie, and with that comes the same clichés and characters we've seen in all of them. That isn't to say the story is bad, it's just more of the same. The pacing however, especially in the second act, is mixed.Overall, it's worth seeing. Maybe not in theaters (especially if you have a home theater at home for the incredible sound design) but it is entertaining enough and it gives you it's fare share of the brutalities of war.",NA
"santiagocosme","7 April 2015","Fury is another one of the many WW2 films out there. It is an OK movie. Just as much as most action packed movies in which the Nazis get what they deserved. However, the one thing that annoyed me is that the characters were so typical in their personality, I guessed who would survived at the end about 20 minutes into the movie. Yes! That's right! And I am normally not that good at guessing endings. Who do we have? Brad Pitt plays the cool guy who always seems to know what to do and how to do it. The Leader. The guy who keeps his soldiers in check. The one that inspires them to fight and be better men when they feel like faltering. As we so often see in movies of this genre, the leader is ALWAYS accompanied by a guy who behaves like a wild beast, another guy that seems more intellectual than the others, a Latin who is retarded, and and and a very weak guy who the leader needs to take under his wing. This guy does not want to fight or to kill anyone. He throws up at the sight of dead bodies. He cries and weeps like a baby. But guess who at the end will show courage beyond belief all of a sudden and inspire his fellow soldiers to show bravery too .I bet you guessed! The weakest link! And who will be the only one making it alive? I bet you guessed who because, it's always the same thing. One other thing that is common in absolutely all the WW2 is the following: if we look back, and we try to be a little fair, the Nazis lost because they went to war with all the countries around them. I mean the whole world was against them. So you could easily say that they lost because of being completely outnumbered. War for them was plainly unsustainable. However, in every single American movie, there's always a scene in which a squad of about 5 to 6 US army soldiers decides to take on a full unit of hundreds of SS soldiers instead of retreating. All of a sudden, the Nazis seem to be the biggest army And guess what happens when 5 us soldiers take on 300 Germans. Yes, I bet you guessed what happens. One would think, that it took about 1000 soldiers to defeat the German War machine. If you are not bothered by this type of clichés (I watch about 4 movies a week so I am really fussy), you will find Fury a good enjoyable movie. But if you are like me, a movie geek, it really feels like you can guess the coming scenes even before they have started. Everyone feels differently about each movie. My opinion: Fury is OK but really nothing special.",NA
"Silvermoviewild","13 February 2016","I have a passion for war movies. If I want to get genuine information about history I would seek it at a library. This movie is great. I liked it and enjoyed the tanks. The accuracy of this movie is not correct but who are we to say that things like this did not happen? It shows the gritty life of war and everything violent that surrounds it. This movie is a journey of emotions. I liked the idea of using real tanks in the film and its not very often we get to see what happens with them. I believe the performances of the actors were very good and cast well. Shia labeouf was very convincing from what he was going through in the movie. Brad Pitt also played his part as well as you would expect. Overall great movie. Don't expect any exact historical events from this movie. To be completely honest, I don't think today's world could handle it.",NA
"russellingreviews","12 November 2014","Walking into the cinema There is an understandable excitement about Fury, but the question is will this film go into the 'just another war movie' category or will it show a different side of war? The opening scene is raw, brutal and shocking and that is an accurate description of rest of Fury. David Ayer's (End of Watch) new film shows the wartime realities from the perspective of soldiers in a tank division during WW2. Fury is the name of their tank and represents their existence. The film is shown in April of 1945, the Allies are making their final push towards Berlin and the end of the war. The Americans ground war is heavily reliant on the armour and fire power of Sherman tanks. From within the armoured exterior of the tanks, Ayer's film provides a wartime view from within the heart of the tank. Showing the war from inside the tank and how the men contend with the fear of the potential coffin the tank can become and the challenges of close quarters of five crew men. The battle- hardened crew is led by army sergeant, Wardaddy (Brad Pitt). They have fought together for the many years and have fought the Nazis in Africa and Europe. Their dependence on each other for survival is evident, but the expected tensions of war-time stress and close living conditions leads to a fascinating on-screen chemistry. When one of their crew is killed in action, a new man is given to the close knit crew. Norman (Logan Lerman), a clerk typist, has to learn to drive the tank and is quickly exposed to the brutal nature of war. He learns from Wardaddy and the crew that to survive he has to come to terms with the 'us or them' mentality of combat. They lead the men throughout the countryside and towns of Germany. Finally, they are left with the assignment of securing a crossroads and confronting a final wave of German SS soldiers. The Fury crew find themselves out-numbered, out-gunned and they have to determine if they will make a sacrificial stand for the sake of the platoon.Ayer has put together a brutal and visceral depiction of war as the backdrop for a story of interconnectedness of men at war. The landscape and battles are well filmed, but do not leave any false pretences of glory. Each battle brings a devastating reality to the war effort and understanding the mindset of the men who have been put into these surreal situations. Seeing the atrocities that mankind can do to one another in loss or victory is sobering and is a stark contrast to many epic war films of the past. There are many effective battle scenes, but the tank battle scene between three Sherman tanks and a German tank is one of the best choreographed battles in modern film. The realistic style of filming may cause some to avert their eyes, but for those who can stomach the visual display will have a better understanding for the attitudes and demeanour of the men in the tank. David Ayer manages to write a film about men who can love one another as men and not feel the need to incorporate any unnecessary sexual undertones. The relationship between the battle hardened David and Jonathan from the Bible came to mind in watching this film. Brad Pitt delivers a stellar performance as Wardaddy and is at his stoic best. He shows the strength needed for an effective leader, but through the many layers of a battle hardened soul he is able to convey a vulnerability and love for his men. He is surrounded by a crew of men who form an effective, but flawed symbiotic unit. Shia LaBeouf has been given one of the best roles of his career and he takes it on with unapologetic fervour. Boyd 'Bible' Swan is the heart and conscience of the tank crew and could have easily become a clique as he quotes Bible passages, but this is not the case with this character. Swan is willing to get into the fight alongside his crewmen, as well as, hold his own in the verbal battles with anyone willing to listen to him. He is loved by his crew and is never trivialised because of his beliefs. The final interchange of Bible quotes between LaBeouf and Pitt is a refreshing dialogue between men and shows a depth of friendship and respect. Michael Peña and Jon Bernthal round out the cast as journeymen who add the needed comic relief and relationship bonding for this type of film. The surprise of the film was Logan Lerman's performance. Coming off his performance in Noah, Lerman is has shifted from teenage actor to adult contender and is proving to be a mature actor that will be worth watching. Throughout the film, Norman quickly grows from innocence to maturity and Lerman effectively conveys this critical transformation. This war time film is truly a character play that develops some great roles in today's cinema.Fury does not pull any punches when it comes to depicting the the realities of war. The violence, the language and conversations of men who have been through so much together garners a warning for discernment. This is not a film for young audiences or for those with a weaker constitution. But unlike most Quentin Tarantino films, Fury does not push the violence to excess. The brutality seems to convey an honest depiction of war and shows the value of masculine camaraderie. David Ayer has put together a great war film that does not glorify war, but shows how something glorious besides battle victory can come from it. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Is the God of the Bible a God of justice? (Psalm 37: 27-29, Romans 12:19) 2. What is the view of war in the Bible?

"Abdulkadiryasar70","22 December 2016","There are a lot of mistakes about battle strategy against a tank in this movie. I mean, despite of I have not military education, I know how I should not attack to a tank like this. We are talking about SS unit, which is special forces of Nazi army. Not ordinary soldiers.20 or 30 SS guys with Panzerfasut would have destroyed an immobilized Sherman tank in 5 or 6 minutes. BUT 200 SS soldiers can't destroy a tank with its tracks off, sitting in the middle of a road? Seriously, one of the silliest, most unrealistic scenes in any war movie.Cast is good enough.

"sixbells99","28 November 2014","The film has plenty of action and should be good watch for WWII buffs But it's the way the action was directed that let the film down. It seems the director never watched Saving Private Ryan, but had watched every episode of the walking dead. The film violence has cartoon like carnage about it, much more in line with a zombie film than a realistic war film. I felt like I was watching the walking dead.Due to this zombie violence there's just no sense of dread and the director never found the soul of the film, I found I never really cared what was going to happen to the characters.But the zombie violence was good enough to have kept me entertained, not a very good ""horrors of war film"", but a good Nazi Zombie film.

"lionelp-91853","8 December 2015","The thing that instantly attracted me to the film was the claustrophobic atmosphere.I can not even imagine how it feels to be in a place like a tank while enemies are shooting from all over the place. Just the thought that a few inches of steel are separating me from death, is enough for my stomach to tighten up and force me to huddle myself to the fetus position and cover my self with a blanket. I think the greatest strength of this film lies in the creation of this divided vision of tank. The tank initially seems bulletproofed and a massive iron fortress, until the moment when we realize that the big hill of steel can be blown up and destroyed to the ground. What is definitely the most interesting in the characters is their attitude about the war, which is actually a great paradox. Although they were discussed with what they were doing but we can see that the heroes of this film show in many moments how really proud they are of what they do.",NA
"brchthethird","19 July 2015","So many war films have been made that it's very hard to create something new or original anymore, at least as far as the drama and story is concerned. David Ayer's gritty, realistic style is pretty much a perfect fit for this type of film, but it was lacking in rich characters and emotional heft (at least to me). The story is about a Sherman tank crew during the final days of WWII who must face overwhelming odds to survive. You have Brad Pitt as the chief, Michael Pena as the driver, Jon Bernthal as the loader, Shia LeBeouf as the gunner, and Logan Lerman as a doe-faced replacement who must overcome his reluctance to fight and kill. I don't think you could have a more stereotypical group of people in a war film. Brad Pitt seems to be playing a more grounded, stoic version of his character from INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, while Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal barely register as little more than caricatures of people. Shia LeBeouf actually acquitted himself rather nicely as a Bible-quoting soldier, which at least distinguished him somewhat from the rest. Logan Lerman, as a conduit for the audience, has a good character arc although it's one we've seen dozens of times before. From a writing perspective, FURY settles for ""been there, done that"" and it suffers as a result. However, David Ayer knows his way around action and the various battle sequences were pretty awesome. I don't think I've seen a war film centered around tank warfare, so at least that was new to me. The violence was gritty and realistic, but not overly graphic. I also thought that the color palate and cinematography helped to create a very distinctive mood and atmosphere, helped along by the often melancholy score. Aside from this, there was a respite from the violence in the middle where Logan Lerman's and Brad Pitt's characters get some development as they temporarily shack up in a house with two German girls. This segment of the film had my favorite part, which is when Logan Lerman plays a song on the piano and one of the girls starts singing along. It was the sweetest moment in an otherwise rather dark film. Thematically, I think the film was often at odds with itself. It wants you to see the protagonists as heroes, yet other than the fact that they're fighting for what we already know is the winning side, little they do would suggest that they are heroic. I'd also be hard-pressed to call any of the characters ""complex."" When it comes down to it, FURY is a rather simple war film that has visceral action and intense visuals. It should do fine for the average film-goer, but I was left wanting a little more.",NA
"bedeabl","30 October 2014","Honestly I'm not a fan of war movies but the reviews and critiques of this film were great so I decided to give it a chance. Thank god I did!At the end of WWII American troops are pushing forward in Germany. Their tanks are not as good as the Germans'. The Germans are desperate and even recruit children to their army. That is where the film takes place. I recommend this film to everybody. With its very strong visuals and dialogues it perfectly shows how terrible war is (and it's not ""over americanized"" like for example ""Saving Private Ryan"") and how hopeless young soldiers are who are there against their will. Here I have to mention the acting of Logan Lerman who was perfect in his role. The other actors were also brilliant. The always criticized Shia LaBeouf really confuted and probably silenced his critics. Brad Pitt also produced one of his best performances. Michael Pena seems to have made a hit and Jon Bernthal showed us that there is life after The Walking Dead.The sound mixing and editing is the same quality as it was in ""Gravity"" which film's composer Steven Price has done a great job again with an excellent and powerful soundtrack. The directing was also great. This was the most noticeable in the fight scenes. Those were extremely thrilling and well-done. We have to mention that the movie is mostly built from clichés but uses them so well that we won't even notice.All in all I think this is how a modern war movie should look like. I hope we hear more about this film when the awarding season comes.",NA
"RNMorton","3 February 2021","Frighteningly effective battle scenes interspersed with some nice moments and emotionally harsh violence. Lerman and von Rittburg stand out. But too much of the harsh, gratuitous violence for me.",NA
"orionnorth2001","23 October 2014","Why is it that WWll lasted as long as it did? After all the Germans in all these movies are killed by the bushel and have absolutely no tactical battlefield ability! Fury brings this to a new height with the final battle scene. An entire SS Battallion armed with Panzerfuasts decides to attack a disabled Sherman Tank frontally not once but repeatedly! Say Hans you think it might be better to pin them down with fire and circle round to the rear of the tank to finish it off with the Panzerfausts? No I think sacrificing the entire battalion in a frontal attack makes more sense. Besides doing it the right way destroys the tank in fifteen minutes and turns a heroic stand into the suicidal idiotic idea it is in the last month of the war. Please Brad stop playing Achillies in every movie!",NA
"sunny_tirpitz","28 October 2014","1. The level of violence: The level of violence in this movie is quite accurate. Hollywood has ""taught"" us in the 60s and 70s that the battles fought in WW2 were somehow of mild violence and conducted by ""gentlemen"" who were highly educated, mannered and fought with honor and respect for the opponent. We all know today that this ""portrait"" is light years away from what really happened then. In 1998 Steven Spielberg has ""destroyed"" this idealistic picture with the best war movie ever made, a movie in which the brutality of combat was shown almost at the ""correct"" level. Almost. This was later corrected in the Band of Brothers mini-series, which contains even more graphic and brutal scenes. But even in this 2 titles the portrayal and description of soldiers was ""softened"" and though they were not as well ""educated and mannered"" as their ""counterparts"" from the 60s and 70s movies, they were still too ""tenderhearted"" for their own good and completely not in tune with the times and with the magnitude of a world war. I am somehow astonished that some people are still ""shocked"" in the era of internet, Live TV and portable cameras by the brutality of the war and by the manner in which humans can slaughter each other. Just look at the violence, intensity and brutality of the 3 major wars of the last 10-11 years: the War in Iraq, the War in Afghanistan and the War in Syria. And these wars are ""limited"" wars, not world wars.2. ""Summary"" executions: Some people talk about how in this movie the US soldiers kill unarmed German prisoners. There are 2 scenes in which captured Germans are killed apparently with no reason: one in which a German soldier is captured while wearing a US army uniform and another scene in which a SS officer is shot after he had surrendered. The first case is simple: any enemy soldier captured wearing an allied uniform has to be executed after interrogation or if the situation can't permit otherwise on the spot. This was the standard procedure on both sides, because once a soldier is dressing up in the uniform of the enemy he is no longer a simple soldier, he is an infiltrator and he must be punish exemplary. The second case is that of an SS officer shot dead after the US forces have captured a town. Before the US forces enter the town, bodies of German teenagers executed by hanging can be seen on the roadside. All these teenagers were executed by the SS officer that was later captured and killed, because they didn't want to ""fight for Germany"". It must be emphasized that the SS members were treated differently than regular German army soldiers, primarily because their fanaticism was one of the last things that hinder the rapid capitulation of Germany at that time and secondly because in April 1945 most of the concentration camps were already discovered and the atrocities committed by the members of the SS were well known by all allied soldiers. That is the case for the so called ""Dachau liberation reprisals"" episode (check the history books or search online) that happened at the end of the war.3. The US tank crew in the movie seem to be cold and brutal: Maybe, if you look at it from the outside. They are fighting in the War for 3 years now (1942 North African Campaign) and at the beginning of the film we find out that one of the crew members has just been killed. So it is normal to see them sad and not very interested in the outside world. Also they know very well that the War will end soon and are frustrated by the fanaticism of their enemies. All these feelings and manifestations are very legit and credible. Again the realism is there. To truly understand them and care about their suffering imagine that you are one of the original crew members, or imagine that you are the fresh recruit that ""has never seen the inside of a tank and who is just a typist trained to type 60 words a minute"". Try to understand their sadness, their fury, the visible signs of post-traumatic stress disorder and their initial unwillingness to accept a new member in their ""family"" after 3 years of combat. Do that and at the end of the movie I guarantee your eyes will water.4. Some combat scenes look exaggerated and not very realistic: Overall the combat scenes are very well made and quite realistic. If you analyze in detail the combat scenes from other great war movies like Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers mini-series, The Thin Red Line etc., you will also find some exaggerated things in them, but that is nothing uncommon, there will never be a war movie 100% accurate. Plus a war movie should make you feel very engaged in what you see and this is not possible without a little dose of extra drama, like the way in which this movie ends.",NA
"matthewssilverhammer","1 November 2014","Fury is a blatant critique of war. While neither a bold or unique position to take, making WWII seem like more than just the justified good guys fighting the inhuman bad guys is no easy feat. Director Ayers has managed to really get into the heads of his characters, deftly showing the momentary boredom, the constant confusion and the incessant fear that come in battle. With a weighty and unglamorous bleakness, Fury stands out as a truly engaging and exciting look through the eyes of a soldier. Ayers and his talented cast have gathered a compelling and fairly accurate collection of war-torn men. Our door into this group is Norman (a well-casted Lerman), a mouse-y new recruit completely out of his element. Without the use of extensive backstory or flashbacks, we are fully engulfed in his brain through heart-wrenchingly intense introductions. Led by a strong and assured Pitt, the camaraderie of the group of weary warriors is palpably honest, but not without moments of natural fun. Rampant with melodrama, the confusion of war almost warrants it. Thankfully these guys are not cookie-cutter Hollywood heroes, but real men, complimented beautifully by the ""antagonistic"" yet utterly human German soldiers. If anything these themes of the humanity within real war are lacking in subtlety, but it's a point well-taken nonetheless. Action wise, I never would've thought tank scenes could be so packed with heart-pounding intensity and exhilaration while staying deeply personal. It's grimy and gory, but never to the point of inappropriate gratuity. So even in its slight downfalls of tropes and predictability, Fury is visceral and individual action-war filmmaking that delivers.",NA
"dalila_tm","19 January 2015","1-No high expectations from trailer but the film changes it all: At the end of the film you realise how good it is. Excellent Drama. Tension. Don't expect a full documentary about WWII, it's not. It's good drama. 2-Excess of ""Brad Pitt"": The film was way too focused on Brad Pitt, but if you can survive to this you'll enjoy the film. 3-Don't get bored by all the talking during the first hour. It's worth watching, specially the last 30min. 4-You can watch it at home. No need to go to the theatre.5-Pay quite attention to the relationship between Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman. Will be key. 6-Excellent acting from Logan Lerman. Best than any other.",NA
"Neptune165","2 March 2023","This movie is my favorite. Fury captures the bond soldiers can develop while serving. No matter how different their personalities may be. This in a extremely under rated film. Gritty, realistic portrayal of the horrors of WWII as seen from the perspective of a Sherman tank crew. Very solid acting and storyline that shows there is no true glory in battle. And this one even more. With an AMAZING cast, the film brings a raw and realistic portrait of the war, showing the horrors of it, using the characters to make transitions, in particular the character of Logan Lerman, who serves as a ""breather"" of humanity, but is pulled into the harsh reality for others. Brad Pitt is excellent, solid acting and genuinely expressing the character's emotions and traumas. The other actors are also excellent. Jon Bernthal in particular, drawing on the insanity generated by that bloody combat. The atmosphere is very well built, with the use of the tank as a claustrophobic element, and you really get attached to the characters, so much so that you feel every loss in the final moment of the film. And what an end, an apotheotic and exciting outcome, with the elevation to hero status of each of the characters.",NA
"kuarinofu","27 September 2020","While watching Fuy I constantly felt like something was missing, I really wanted it to be deeper. The characters were there, but we don't really dive deep into them.The production value combined with the soundtrack was what made it captivating, but the resolution was just right out a summer blockbuster. In a film about war, I didn't quite expect a Michael Bay ending. And even though the movie really wanted to make me emotional about the last stand...it just didn't work.I'm not a war historian, but I also spotted some weird choices and the lack of realism. It still would've been fine, but the story itself just doesn't know what it's trying to be.Now, writing this short review while watching the credits, I am not emotionally moved or drained, and for a war film, a thoughtful message or a strong emotional root should be the thing that makes it stand out. And while the introductory act felt like it was trying to establish something, later scenes were either confusing or just straight-up nonsensical (including the dialogue).It actually made me sad that a film with such production value and actors was so mishandled to the point of becoming a simple action film with propaganda undertones.",NA
"Jerghal","18 January 2015","Fury suffers from one of the problems many American WWII movies have: the Nazi's seem more humane than the liberators. In this film there is actually an act of kindness by an SS soldier and absolutely none by our 'heroes'. The main characters are brutes bent on killing as much German soldiers as they can and OK there are some scenes where they try to expose the duality of war but in general the Yankees come of as self righteous mass murderers. On that level Saving Private Ryan was a lot better. But as you ignore this twisted morality you can say the actors (certainly Brad Pitt) are playing some bad-ass guys. The film isn't wall to wall action, but when there is, it's pretty cool. The surround sound FX are awesome and the visuals are great. For 60m$ this movie looks a lot more expensive. If you like war movies certainly check it out. Personally I liked it but I would put below favorites of mine like Saving Private Ryan, Enemy at the Gates or Inglorious Bastards.",NA
"bingfengjuly","15 November 2014","The story is awful and simple.Maybe the direct of the movie think Germans are all idiots. They cant shoot, don't know how to cover themselves and even they can let 3 guys carrying children, women, and old with a whole operation team. Even in World of Tanks, we know Tiger is a strong tank. It cant be easily destroyed by a M4 Sherrman. The writer of the story totally don't have proper knowledge about tanks and wars.He's only creating things using his simple mind.In conclusion, this movie can only shows the ignorance and arrogance of Americans.Stupid movie.The music is awful, too...",NA

"kenstallings-65346","8 July 2023","The movie's highest merit is in showing a typical tank crews' lives during the ETO. The reality was as the movie script introduced. Our tanks were technically inferior in every way except reliability, numbers, and speed during the last 12 months of the war to most of what the German military fielded.Consequently, things were quite dangerous for American and British tank crews, and no tank was introduced during the war to significantly alter than reality. Once in the movie early, a tank NCO says that with their losses, it was hard to believe the Allies were winning the war.Truth is, the allies were winning the war despite losing nearly all tank on tank battles, until fuel shortages and reliability issues turned German tank units into paper units.The ending as many have pointed out was a bit fantastical, but my personal view is it was plausible given the situation. The NCO tank commander was given the situation that if that German unit advance past the road intersection, that it would be able to flank attack the supply lines for the entire division.Given this, making the decision to risk certain death to attrite as much of the German unit as possible is a militarily rational decision, but clearly heroic.A German unit well trained and equipped would have not allowed itself to be so chewed up as shown in the final scenes. But, keep in mind that even so-called elite units of the German military were, by April 1945, filled by poorly trained and grossly inexperienced troops. So, getting the men to know how to flank a tank would have been a challenge.The movie did an outstanding job of showing how American tank crews coordinated their actions with fellow tank crews as well as supporting infantry.",NA
"chera_khalid","20 September 2023","""Fury"" delivers a gritty and intense portrayal of World War II, earning its 6/10 rating through its strengths and weaknesses. The film's strength lies in its visceral depiction of the brutalities of war, brought to life through impressive cinematography and realistic battle sequences. Brad Pitt's commanding performance anchors the movie, alongside a solid ensemble cast. The visuals are hauntingly evocative, immersing viewers in the chaos of combat. However, despite its merits, the film's character development feels somewhat limited, and at times, the dialogue might lean toward cliché. While ""Fury"" doesn't reach the heights of some other war films, it remains a visceral and engaging depiction of the harrowing experiences of soldiers during WWII.",NA
"jimbo-53-186511","4 April 2020","Hardened tank commander Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt) becomes an unwilling mentor to unprepared novice Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) who is not prepared for war having previously served his time behind a typewriter. Nevertheless Collier guides his men through enemy lines in Germany, but at what cost??So here it is Fury probably one of the most bloated and overrated war films that I've ever seen; instead of offering us an insightful and involving character piece Fury instead became a macho chauvinistic display of empty emotion with most of the characters behaving like the biggest bunch of jerks you're ever likely to see. This is purportedly based on US Tank Crews during the final moments of World War 2 which begs the question; were they all objectionable like the guys depicted here? I have to admit that it was not a lot of fun sitting through this film and the only character I felt any real sympathy for was Norman.So aside from all of this what else happened? Well there's lots of shouting, noise, bravado and of course the US of A killing several Germans. At one point in the film there are some moments of quiet reflection which add nothing and only serve to elongate the film past its already generous 2 hour plus running time.The acting is not much to write home about; the likes of Pena, La Bouef, Bernthal and Pitt are all in the film, but if I'm honest I'd struggle to remember their names or anything about them as this is clearly not important to anyone that made this film. Pitt's character becomes somewhat sympathetic towards the end, but even he is a persona that is hard to endure. Only Logan Lerman comes away as being a sympathetic character (perhaps that was the point), but at least he was someone we could root for.Despite a lot of potential, Fury is far too superficial and thin to become really involved in and, truth be told, when watching the film it looked like I was watching someone else play a computer game so yes pretty uninvolving stuff truth be told.",NA
"ShelbyTMItchell","26 October 2014","Brad Pitt leads an all star cast with Shia LeBeouf as the Bible quoting soldier, Jon Berthanel as the jerk with a heart of gold soldier, Logan Lerhman as the fresh out of boot camp typist clerk rookie, Michael Pena as the Latino soldier.All five of them are the wisecracking but work very hard group that has a ""home"" in the tank called ""Fury"" which they fight alongside as band of brothers over in Germany and with the Nazis.They are unbeatable in the tank. While fighting the Nazis and also playing with each other. Logan's character goes from being a wide eyed innocent to being hardened as his character develops the most, out of the five.The ending I won't give away but will say, the men face the most ultimate challenge in winning the war.
