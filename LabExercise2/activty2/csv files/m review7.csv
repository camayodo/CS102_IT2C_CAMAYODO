"TheLittleSongbird","9 June 2009","I thought this a very well done film indeed. I will say the film looks just splendid, especially the scenes in Narnia, with beautiful snowy sets (some looked as though it had come from the LOTR trilogy). However, some of the scenes looked as though they had been computerised, such as the scene with the children and beavers running across the ice. There were also some attempts to put some humour into the story like the professor's line ""ah yes, the weeping one"" in reference to Lucy and the beavers especially, but because the director had taken liberties to make the story darker, the humour didn't quite work. However there are a number of positives, like the spirited performances of the children, Georgie Henley especially, better than Sophie Wilcox's rather goofy portrayal in the 1988 series. James McAvoy is charming as Mr. Tumnus, and Liam Neeson was majestic as Aslan. But the acting honours go to Tilda Swinton as the White Witch, even with her calmness she dominates the screen, in a sometimes chilling portrayal as the character. The film was fairly faithful to the book, but the added scenes and dialogue failed to engage as much. All, a flawed but enjoyable film. 7/10 Bethany Cox","

"lavatch","29 December 2005","With an appeal to both adults and children, the British author C. S. Lewis wrote seven books in his Chronicles of Narnia series. The stories are rich in mythology and religious symbolism, drawing upon archetypes from the Norse, Greco-Roman, Persian, medieval chivalric, and Judeo-Christian traditions.Now comes this wonderful film of the first chronicle, ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."" The beautiful cinematography and the terrific performances of the children make this film outstanding for family viewing. As integrated with the live actors, the colorful animal characters, especially the Lion (Jesus), reveal brilliant technical film-making as well.Lewis's books are not overtly allegorical. Rather, the symbols and the messages are subtle. The four children in the story (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) were inspired by the actual children evacuated from London during World War II, who spent time in Lewis's home. Lewis wanted his books to be enjoyed by young people who would later in their lives draw the spiritual meanings from the stories. In this area, the film is enormously faithful to the original book and would have made the author extremely proud.","

"arabianardour","23 December 2005","The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe should go down in the history books right up there with the likes of Lord of the Rings. I went to see it expecting a very good movie. I came out stunned by the magnitude of the picture. Everything about it is so well done, the casting, the scenery, the score. Lord of the Rings is the only thing I can think of to compare it to. I experienced the same overwhelming sense of awe watching both of these phenomenal pictures. The CG images are very good, though not quite as startlingly realistic as those in LOTR. I cannot find fault with the casting in any way.Though the voice of Liam Neeson is not as I would have imagined a lion's at first, it is smooth, confident, and effective. Aslan is given the presence so essential to the heart of the story. I must comment on the performance of James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus, which I believe was the best in the film. Lucy was adorable, and surprisingly convincing, and Peter was given a very firm performance. I was a little nervous about how Edmund would turn out, but I needn't have worried; those large, startlingly dark eyes are perfect for the change from traitor to hero. I commend the directors of the movie on their strict adherence to the book. Narnia isn't just ""based"" on the book. It IS the book. The scope, depth, and wonder of Lewis's world have been captured in a timeless manner that should be cherished for all ages. This is a movie for everyone, at a level for children to understand, yet with a fast plot and exciting battle sequences that will keep anyone interested. The last battle scene especially is as touching as any I have ever seen, including those in LOTR, putting tears in my eyes even while my heart soared. Go see Narnia for an exciting, well-done film, and a timeless message that our world so desperately needs.Ten stars!!","

"long-ford","9 January 2009","The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is an extremely enjoyable filmization of CS Lewis's magical childhood epic. The story expertly weaves in childhood themes with a modern day Christian plot line (including a slightly grisly 'crucifiction' scene) to create an enchanting motion picture. Tilda Swinton is superb as the sinister White Witch. The children are average though young Georgie Henly stands out. The Special effects are more than adequate, with a specially impressive rendering of Aslan. The film moves slowly initially and its epic nature become apparent only towards the end with a vicious (but bloodless) final battle. All told, a pleasant surprise indeed! Overall 8/10","

"ma-cortes","11 December 2007","This enjoyable story produced by Walt Disney Pictures is based on C.S Lewis books. It begins during German air raids over London in WWII. The Pevensie four children(Henley,Keynes,Moseley and Poppewell) are sent to live at the country house of eccentric teacher Kike(Jim Broadvent). Meantime they're playing hide and seek, Lucy encounters a strange wardrobe that lead the snowy land of Narnia . There, she finds a sympathetic but coward faun(James McAvoy). Later she returns at home and the others don't believe her at first, but soon are convinced. Then, all of them go throughout the fantastic world with fauns and centaurs and where animals speaking, a beaver( voice by Ray Winstone), fox(voice by Rupert Everett) and furthermore the Father Christmas(James Cosmo). This magic land with perpetual winter is ruled by the nasty White Witch(Tilda Swinton). But the children are the chosen ones, according an ancient prophecy, and they team up with Aslem, the mighty Lion and real king of Narnia , fighting to defeat the evil witch in an epic finale battle.The pic is a magic story with rip-snorting adventures, exciting fantasy, sensational scenarios and good feeling. Plenty of action and emotion and with an incredible battle scenes similar to ¨Lord of the Rings¨. Provide enough amusement to keep the chat rooms humming until the epic ending comes out. In spite of overlong runtime and the difficult of adapting, the film still managing to keep a quick enough pace for those unfamiliar with the lengthy literary and highly detailed work by C. S. Lewis. This two and a half hour movie stays closer to the original work than any of the former efforts, mostly animated. The film displays a colorful and evocative cinematography by Donald McAlpine. Musical score fitting perfectly to the action-adventure by Harry Gregson-Williams. The motion picture is marvellously directed by Andrew Adamson, he's the director,producer, writer of ¨Shrek¨ trilogy. Rating : Above average and worthwhile seeing . It's a very likable adventure-fantasy and enormously appealing for kids, adolescents and all family.","

"stiva","31 December 2008","A wonderful movie. The characters are beautifully made from a well chosen characters. The CGI and special effects are top notch. The centaurs, beavers, trees, tigers, bears, fox, all are taking. Oh! yeah, they are talking. The creators have done an excellent job in bringing out the emotions, the lip sync, and the body language of various animal, very well. The White Witch was scary as hell. The final battle sequence was spectacular. I was amazed with the battle sequence.Aslan's character was the best. I love the way the Lion talks, walks and emotes. It's simply amazing. Amazing direction. Amazing music. Excellent make-up. Amazing editing work. A very good adoption of the Narnia series. Very funny movie too. Worth watching.","

"evawatches","29 November 2005","To sum things up: I loved this movie.I had been waiting for it ever since it was announced, so of course I couldn't pass up the chance to see a press preview this morning. And, while there were some definite weaknesses (mostly in the quality of the animations), overall I was completely convinced. Naturally it did not coincide 100% with my own vision of Narnia visually, but emotionally it rang absolutely true, choking me up several times and really touching me. I walked out of the theatre with a warm, contented feeling - just like I feel every time I read C.S. Lewis' book! The stand-out performance was definitely Tilda Swinton's as the White Witch, but I liked all actors/voices, from cute little Lucy (newcomer Georgie Henley) to majestic Aslan (Liam Neeson). I thought the children did a great job, considering their relative inexperience and the amount of blue screen work involved.Tip: Stay seated through the actor credits - afterwards there's another small scene.","

"nycritic","10 January 2006","After the massive success of LORD OF THE RINGS it would be only fitting to continue the exploration of other dimensions as created by equally talented authors, so when it was announced that C. S. Lewis' THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDBROBE would be given the film treatment I was more than anxious to see what would come of it. Early screenings gave it great reviews, and when I viewed I wasn't disappointed despite the Christ references.Four children are sent away from their London home to a professor's estate in the countryside in order to escape the bombings from the Nazi invaders. What they find there, aside from a severe place not unlike what V. C. Andrews would depict in FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC, is a wardrobe that opens the doors to another world -- a parallel one if you may -- in which winter is ever present, but Christmas never takes place. This is Narnia, and it is under control of the White Witch Jadis who is aware of a prophecy that four humans will put an end to her wintry empire, and sets out her minions against the children who have entered her world while bribing one of them -- the rebellious Edmund -- to join her as she holds him prisoner much like the witch in Hansel and Gretel did. Her plans are to overthrow the Lion King, Aslan, and rule forever. Parallels to her world and the world as threatened by the Nazis are striking, and Tilda Swinton's transformation into the very Aryan looking Jadis is chilling, more so in her seductiveness. At times I was reminded of Cate Blanchett (they have very similar features), but I think Blanchett is to Galadriel as Swinton is to Jadis. Marvelous actresses both, but Swinton can claim her breakthrough with her role here.With much less gravitas than the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA arrives much faster to its goal than the former does and the reason is that the books C. S. Lewis wrote are fairly slim volumes while J. R. R. Tolkien's book is a massive tome. Also, there is always the sense that the NARNIA books are more geared towards children and for much of the movie's duration there is little doubt that this is what it is: its four leads are children, many of the talking animals they meet are drawn in a way to appeal to children, and even the White Witch's castle has a storybook quality to it. Only in the appearance of Aslan does the story take a much more adult form, and its Messianic theme will not be lost on the older audience. Even so, the implications surrounding Aslan's self immolation can be interpreted in non-religious forms: if anything, it's also very similar to Gandalf's fall into the pit with the Balrog in tow in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. Both character's 'death' symbolize their own necessary transmogrification, only to arise more powerful than before and take their troops to victory.NARNIA is a visually stunning film even in its quiet moments when the children, one by one, are entering its world through the wardrobe. I was reminded of Stephen King's DARK TOWER series: unless the characters believed in the world behind the wardrobe, it didn't exist, and this is true here. Narnia only exists if you believe hard enough in it, and time, of course, stops... or let's say, it marches at a totally different beat, also visible in Stephen King's DARK TOWER series.Performances are quite remarkable, especially for a fantasy film. All of the actors doing the voice overs bring their characters to bubbling life, and Liam Neeson as Aslan is wise and all-knowing. The child actors are definitely comfortable in their roles and while I saw glimpses of the children of the aforementioned V. C. Andrews Gothic novel, they are real people: The younger ones fare better than the older ones, but then again they are on screen more and their stories are more crucial than the older ones although all four eventually converge into the climactic battle sequence.All in all a great film, equally meant to be enjoyed by children and adults alike, and one which should spawn a very interesting following.","

"tollini","5 December 2005","I saw this film on November 30th in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival that screens films for their Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.Four young children enter the timeless world of Narnia through the door of a wardrobe piece of furniture while playing hide-and-seek. And what a world it is. There are talking animals, dwarfs, giants, beasts, centaurs, and indescribable half-human combinations. And, in this world of Narnia there is a titanic struggle between the White Witch and her evil army and the good lion Aslan and his noble army. Although it doesn't seem possible, you can suspend disbelief and become engaged in the story because the artistry and technology are so outstanding. The art direction, special effects, cinematography, editing and sound will most likely and should be nominated for Academy Awards. The lion Aslan dominates your attention in every scene he appears in, and as the story unfolds, he becomes as human-like as any of the four children. The four children seem normal enough with their constant teasing and fighting among themselves, but when events truly matter, they come together and exemplify the highest standards of sacrifice, courage, fidelity and heroism. Both children and adults will find inspiration and role models in these four children. The lion Aslan is a mystical and almost biblical hero. There are many parallels between Aslan and Christianity, and you can watch this film anywhere in the religious-secular spectrum you care to. I suspect that over many years the other six books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia will be made into movies and they will have the same type of financial and artistic success as The Lord of the Rings film trilogy had. That is high praise indeed.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.","

"Pasafist","3 December 2005","There is one scene in Andrew Adamson's new film THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, that for me walking into the theater that needed to be perfect. If not the whole movie and (the continued franchise of sequels) would fall flat on its face. If the film did not capture this scene I believe the heart and soul of C.S. Lewis and his magical world would have been completely destroyed.But I digress! Walking into Narnia is an interesting experience for me. In all honesty I find C.S. Lewis to be a great writer that I can hardly read. His books are hailed left and right and I just can't read them. It's not Lewis's fault. I realize it's my own media saturated thick head that blocks me up. So a few weeks ago after a screening of a 10 minute super trailer for NARNIA I decided to dust off my old copy of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA and decided to give it a chance. I read the first two books in about a week and I wondered to myself. What was my problem? What took me so long to become enchanted by this mystical world? I've come to realize I cannot appreciate the classics. I really think that's my loss and something I intend to work on in the new year.So anyway, sitting down in the movie theater I psyched myself up I intended to be wowed. I wanted Narnia to come alive on screen like it did in my mind and I think it fell a little short of my expectations but in the end made me smile.NARNIA tells the story of four children. When the youngest named Lucy (Georgie Henley) finds a magic wardrobe that transports her into the magical land of Narnia. Narnia is a land of talking animals, magical fauns, and the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton) whose enslaved the land causing it to be forever winter and never Christmas. Her sister Susan (Anna Popplewell), and brothers Peter (William Moseley), and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) don't believe her story. Until the day all the children enter the Land of Narnia. A land and get caught up in a war that may fulfill a prophecy that will bring peace to Narnia.NARNIA is a fascinating example of a film that doesn't exactly add up but in the end is satisfying. The screenplay is riddled with the problems from the very beginning. It tries so hard to stick to the book that the early moments of the film feel flat. Even when the children get to Narnia you feel the same way. Narnia feels just like the British Country side the children have come from. Narnia should feel different and it doesn't. Why is their a light post growing in the middle of the forest? Why are the animals talking? Why is it always winter and yet never Christmas? These questions should inspire awe. NARNIA should glow and jump off the screen, but the first act is to busy getting from point a to point b than to allow us to immerse ourselves in the NARNIAN landscape. If your like me you'll find yourself thinking ""why does this feel like a third rate LORD OF THE RINGS?"" I think what's missing is the thing that made the novel so enchanting. It's Lewis's self aware narration. Even when at the greatest peril it was Lewis's kind words and silly aside comments that lightened the situation. Admittedly that would be difficult in a film but It would have been nice if they'd tried. Instead they stuck humor in places that seemed out of place.But fear not, all is not lost. Because if you can get through the first hour (which really isn't that bad). You'll come out on the other side and into a much better and powerful movie. Once Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) the Mighty Lion comes on the screen you're in for the ride of your life.I mentioned earlier there is one scene that needed to be perfect or the film would be destroyed. That scene involves Aslan and the stone table. They got it right, and oh boy was I impressed. If Aslan is not strong, if Aslan is not seen as a threat even as he is being tormented this scene falls apart. But Adamson and his team make Aslan a character to be reckoned with. If you don't gasp as Aslan climbs those stairs and the beasts and the White Witch part the way for him, if you don't feel the pain and anguish of Aslan's torment, and if your tear ducts don't well up when the scene is over, I would doubt your humanity ( just a little.) After that the film only gets better, there is an awesome battle sequence, and even Narnia begins to take a life of its own. It gives each character their moment to shine and it wraps itself up neatly enough. After the film was over I can't wait for PRINCE CASPIAN (or THE HORSE AND HIS BOY) to hit the big screen.I would also like to single out little Georgie Henley (watch out Dakota Fanning) the little girl who plays Lucy. She gives the early part of the film a lot more life and fills the screen like very few child actors can. This little girl (in her debut role) has an innocence and yet a maturity that belies her age. This little girl gives a performance that should really net her an Oscar nod. It probably won't but if I didn't bring it up who would? While this film has a few rough spots and a first act that needed some work THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, and THE WARDROBE is an enchanting journey that is worth the price of admission. Seek it out.","

"Movieguy_blogs_com","6 December 2005","C.S. Lewis' classic is reborn in 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', when four children from war-torn England find themselves transported to a land of myth and fantasy. It has been foretold that they will bring peace to Narnia. But can they survive the evil treachery of the mysterious White Witch who claims to be Queen? In this rendition, C.S. Lewis' imagination is brought to life with amazing special effects. Centaurs, Fauns, and Gryphons all come to life in this great body of work. The whole family will enjoy this film. Liam Neeson is wonderful as Aslan the Lion.I can not say that was all that impressed with Tilda Swinton as the White Witch. She looked the part, but did not seem as treacherous as I had hoped.Overall this is a really good film. If you are familiar with the story, then there are no real surprises, but makes up for it with incredible CGI animation.","

"Rathko","12 December 2005","A strangely disappointing experience given the quality credentials of just about all involved.The relative inexperience of the writers is clearly evident. Whether seen as a metaphor for a world without God (hell), or the Nazi regime, the cultural and social landscape of Narnia is ripe with potential, none of which is realized here. The White Witch's regime is not explored, we are not told who she is, where she came from, how or why she took over the world. She lacks any motivation or real emotional drive. Similarly, the children seem happy to throw themselves into a war without a second thought of home. Nothing in this story is ever explained, we are simply expected to accept it without question, which is a far more dictatorial representation of Christianity than Lewis ever intended. The plotting lacks energy and momentum, with no real sense of suspense. The characterization is weak and one-dimensional. But even more surprisingly from the creators of Shrek, is the complete lack of humor.The acting is sound from all but the leads. The two older children struggle to bring the necessary range of emotion to their roles, with Moseley in particular presenting a decidedly weak interpretation of heroic kingliness. The two younger children luckily make up for their on screen siblings' shortcomings, with Henley bringing the wide-eyed innocence to Lucy that the role requires, and Keynes displaying a surprising amount of subtlety as the eternally wronged and resentful Edmund. McAvoy and Swinton are both excellent and at times are required to carry the movie alone.The CGI is competent, but little more. It's always good to see Fauns and Centaurs running around, but it doesn't break any boundaries in terms of design or execution. There's none of the thrill of the vast armies of Middle Earth, or the attention to the minutiae of Narnia that is really necessary in realizing a new world from scratch.Disney clearly hopes that this will bring them the rewards that 'Lord of the Rings' brought New Line Cinema and 'Harry Potter' is bringing to Warner Brothers. But 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' lacks the emotional depth, epic range, creative inventiveness and dramatic urgency of the 'Rings' trilogy. Similarly, it has none of the humor, camaraderie, charisma or charm of 'Harry Potter'. Judging from the audience that I saw it with, it will be very popular, and a sequel is very probable, but unless Narnia finds some heart and soul, the complete cycle seems unlikely.","

"becksy_8","5 December 2005","The visuals for this film are absolutely stunning. Just breathtaking. The acting is done well, the voice-overs included. the CG animation on the creatures are marvelous. I read this series over and over as a child and just re-read them recently in anticipation of the movie. Although as a purist-at-heart I was slightly disappointed to see even a second of the precious work edited, overall I am amazed at how well they adapted the tale to fit into a neat little 2 hour time frame. I feel that nothing important was omitted and the parts that were adjusted in the script were done so well that it still could have passed for C.S. Lewis' own hand. I was lucky enough to preview this film (and to see it free, to boot), but I am certain that I will be trekking to the theatre to see it a few more times on the big screen. BRAVO!","

"MovieAddict2016","3 January 2006","I left ""Narnia"" feeling kind of cold. I loved the books as a child, and most specifically ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" which I read numerous times when I was young...but no matter how faithful the adaptation is - story-wise - some elements don't fit into place.I think it's one of those books that is better off left as a book. The themes and actions that take place in C.S. Lewis' Christian allegory do not translate well to the screen. I felt that something was off. The direction by Andrew Adamson (""Shrek"") is commendable, but the second half of the movie is very bright, the animation throughout is quite poor (except for Aslan), and the final battle comes across as utterly silly.Also, by squeezing the book into a two-hour movie whilst still retaining the essence of the novel, Adamson's film lacks cohesion. It all happens too fast. The characters are rather thin and I felt as if some scenes were handled poorly. For example, when Edmund first meets the White Witch -- if you were a young child who had just stumbled into a world inside a wardrobe, then told by a queen you were going to be the king, don't you think it'd be hard to conceal your excitement? Instead, Edmund returns into the real world, and the only hint we get that he's thinking about Narnia is when a very poor exposition scene occurs with Peter pointing out how Edmund is sulking about.The course of action in the film is poorly developed as well. One minute they're reluctant to fight, the next minute they're armored up. The problem is that with a two-hour film like this, it's hard to develop the characters. In a novel, it's easier - the general narratives of novels make us feel more attached to the characters. WATCHING them is much different - and it's hard to take their decision to join Narnia's battle against the White Witch very seriously at all.Also, maybe I was the only one who noticed that young Georgie Henley (who plays Lucy) was always smiling. Not just a happy smile, though. A wicked smile, like she's just played a trick on somebody and ready to savor the revenge. It's kind of creepy. When she cries at the end, it still looked like she was ready to stab someone in the back and break into a maniacal laugh.Am I being harsh? Probably a bit too much, yes. It's just that coming from a child-at-heart who loved this particular book years ago, I feel the adaptation as a whole is simply mediocre. I felt disattached from the characters, I thought the animation was poor, some scenes were handled poorly, and the final battle was a joke.Overall, it's worth seeing if you like the book(s). I was personally disappointed by the film, but it seems - judging from its IMDb rating - most people weren't.Hopefully the sequel will be better.","

"missmissa","10 December 2005","When Peter Jackson made The Lord of the Rings into an epic trilogy, I knew that someday soon my favorite story as a child would come to life. This film is everything I could have hoped for. The special effects were amazing. When the various creatures spoke, it didn't seem like a puppet was speaking, it seemed like the animal was actually speaking. And I don't think anyone has ever managed to make CG fur look this realistic. I am also very impressed with the centaurs. They blended a real person on what was probably CG horse. These centaurs were about 100 times better than the last centaur I saw, which was in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. This is also a wonderful film about forgiveness and how families will always stand by one another, even in the darkest of times. This aspect of the film is well acted by all four children in the leading roles. No film is perfect, however. There is at least one shot where the children are very obviously against a backdrop, though I do think there is at least one shot like this in every effects laden film. And while the centaurs are quite impressive, what I think are supposed to be Minotaurs are not impressive at all, they just look like guys in big fury suits, which is probably what they are. There has also been a lot of controversy about how this is some sort of Christian propaganda story, which it's not. It's a fantasy just like Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, or Star Wars. I'm really surprised more controversy hasn't been raised over the fact that you basically have children leading others into battle. This idea is kind of a risky notion in today's political climate. This idea will probably go over most children's' heads, but it is definitely something to think about as an adult. I saw this film in an auditorium full of children, parents, grandparents, and teenagers and the end was met with thunderous applause. This is a truly beautiful film that appeals to the young and the old in all of us.","

"JamesHitchcock","22 January 2014","As a child, I was never a great lover of C. S. Lewis's ""The Chronicles of Narnia"". The books were always too preachy in tone for my liking, and if there was one thing that was guaranteed to kill a book stone dead for me it was the suspicion that the adult world were using it to put forward some morally improving message. My suspicions were confirmed when a classmate of mine, a boy whose great ambition, even at the age of ten, was to be Archbishop of Canterbury when he grew up, explained to me that the whole series was essentially one long extended Christian allegory. (And yes, he probably did use the word ""allegory"" even at that tender age). I have never been tempted to revisit the books in adult life, so was surprised that I enjoyed the film version of ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" so much. The story opens in London during the Second World War. Four siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, are evacuated during the Blitz to a large house in the countryside, owned by an eccentric professor. While playing hide-and-seek one day they discover a wardrobe which acts as a gateway into the fantasy land of Narnia. Once there, they get caught up in a power-struggle between Aslan the Lion and Jadis, the evil White Witch. White witches, of course, are normally portrayed as being on the side of good, as opposed to the evil black witches, but in the case of Jadis the adjective relates not to her moral character but to her love of dressing in that colour and to the fact that under her rule Narnia is an icy wilderness, a land ""where it is always winter but never Christmas"". From what I can recall, the film follows Lewis's plot fairly closely, so for those who like that sort of thing the religious symbolism is still there. Aslan clearly represents Christ and Jadis the Devil. There are parallels to the Fall of Man, with a bowl of Turkish Delight standing in for the apple, and to the Crucifixion and Resurrection. This symbolism is, however, applied lightly enough to enable the film to be enjoyed as a family fantasy adventure rather than as a beginner's guide to the Christian religion. Lewis was a colleague and close friend of J R R Tolkien, so it is perhaps appropriate that ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" has something in common with Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, which was also shot in New Zealand, especially during the battle scenes near the end. It is, however, somewhat lighter in tone than Jackson's mighty epic.On the acting side, the one really outstanding contribution comes from an icily seductive Tilda Swinton as the White Witch. Aslan comes across as a bit one-dimensional, noble and heroic and not much else, but that is less the fault of Liam Neeson, who provided the voice, as of Lewis, who wrote him like that.Lewis's mythology was essentially a hodge-podge of various other mythologies, especially Greek, so the film features such creatures as fauns, centaurs, griffins, minotaurs, dwarfs and various talking beasts, and the computer-generated imagery is able to bring all of these vividly to life. One thing which did not strike me as a child was just how surreal Lewis's world can be, possibly because surrealism was not a concept with which I was really acquainted at the age of ten. This is, however, something brought out in the film version, particularly in the early scenes where the children enter that eerie snow-covered world, a world where Victorian lamp-posts mysteriously sprout in the middle of a dense coniferous forest, where rather camp fauns invite you back to their homes for tea and cakes and where beavers talk with cockney accents and eat fish-and-chips. Who could fail to enjoy a world like that? Perhaps Lewis, the staid, conservative, devoutly religious Oxford don, had more in common with Salvador Dali than he might have liked to admit. 8/10","

"WriterDave","10 May 2006","Adam Adamson's film adaptation of C. S. Lewis' first entry in his classic Narnia Series starts off awkwardly like a combination of the ""Wizard of Oz"" and ""Lord of the Rings."" The filmmakers spend too much time early on trying to be cute and Disney-fy the product while clumsily presenting scenes composed of live-action actors and not-so-great computer effects. The result, not surprisingly is like an animated film with some flesh-and-blood actors spliced in. However, once you get used to the film stylistically, all is mostly forgiven.The filmmakers finally find solid ground when they really start to dig deeply into the story and reveal the blending of nature-based neo-paganism with medieval Christian mythology and wrap it up nicely into a children's fairytale. It's when you start to realize the white witch (played effectively by the always somewhat creepy Tilda Swinton) represents the old pre-Abraham polytheism demanding animal and human sacrifice for appeasing the pantheon of gods/goddesses and the lion king, Aslan, represents the Christian view of one self-sacrificing god that you remember the brilliance of Lewis' source material. And while it isn't terribly well executed, the epic ""Battle-Beast"" style showdown at the end is pretty entertaining from a visual and imaginative standpoint.","

"bertsaraco","4 December 2005","The audience at this afternoon's preview screening of The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe, at New York's AMC 25 theater in Times Square, broke out in spontaneous applause at least three or four times. It seems that director Andrew Adamson has brought a thaw to normally-jaded New Yorkers as well as to the 100-year winter of Narnia. The movie pulls the viewer into the story right from the opening scenes of war-ravaged England, where siblings Lucy, Susan, Peter and Edmund (wonderful performances by all) are sent from their homes to the relative safety of 'the professor's' country estate where, during a game of hide-and-go-seek, young Lucy hides in the wardrobe only to discover the passage to the land of Narnia. From this point, the multi-layered story of betrayal, courage, sacrifice, redemption and hope unfolds into a briskly paced 2 hour and ten minute adventure that leaves the viewer emotionally charged and thoroughly entertained. The musical score is appropriately stirring and moody. The computer generated creatures are sophisticated to the point where the technology disappears and you begin to accept the performance, and not the special effect! This brings us to Aslan - if the talking lion didn't work, the movie would fold in on itself and go away. Aslan works,however, and works very well. Voiced by Liam Neeson, Alsan is both believable as a 'literal' lion and as Aslan, talking lion, King of Narnia. Aslan's face is expressive and noble, and Neeson's voice acting has strength and dignity. This film succeeds on so many levels, it would be possible to discuss it in many different veins: the direction, the story's surface-level themes, the theological possibilities, the drama, the fantasy, the adventure.... Yes - it's an action film, a dramatic film, a fantasy, a somewhat-dark (yet hopeful) fairy-tale. It has humorous moments and frightening moments, like most truly great 'family' films always seem to have. The bottom line is, this is a film that will leave you the better for having seen it. There's much to reflect on and much to simply enjoy - there's certainly enough to keep you thinking for a while, and that's always a good thing. Aslan, indeed, is on the move!","

"Edu-16","11 December 2005","This review courtesy of someone who grew up in a house called 'Narnia' (replete with lamp-post in garden)- and as an adult who now owns a boat called 'Dawn Treader'. I guess I'm a bit of a Narnia nut in the same way that King Kong is a bit of a monkey. I read the Chronicles many many times as a child and I've recently had the pleasure of reading them all over again - to my own children.All of which means (a) I'm not very objective about the film - and (b) I had some major 'views' about how things ought to be done prior to the screening.For those out there with similar Narnia heritage I think you will be pleasantly surprised. I personally enjoyed the effort a lot - and on only a very few occasions did I sniff disapprovingly into my popcorn. The kids (9 & 7 respectively and with a mere single reading under the belts!) loved every minute of it.The good things. Lucy ( in looks a sort of mini Ann Widdecombe for all you UK politicos out there) was very good. Think the director must take a lot of credit for her performance. If Lucy had been bad, then this venture would have failed. Thankfully she shines. The others children I thought were a little ho-hum with Peter being the weakest.Tumnus was excellent - although our more cynical time applies some rather uncomfortable sinister overtones to the scenes with Lucy.Yes the Beavers were fun - as was the fox. Could have done with more explanation about the whole 'animals' talking thing though. It's remarked on rather too briefly I thought. (One of many problems with doing this book first instead of The Magicians Nephew - which explains the genesis of Narnia, how the animals start speaking and where the white witch comes from etc.) The White witch? - pretty good I thought, although maybe a little one dimensional. However I didn't like her 'home' which I felt as others have noted derivative and out of place in look and architecture to the rest of Narnia.Aslan - bang on. There is nothing CGI cant do now. (My brother and nephew wanted Aslan to be larger relative to other animals. My recollection of the book suggested he changed size to fit the occasion - so I had no problems myself) The stone table scene. Excellent and very true to the book.Now for those elements that were for me less good.The wood. Maybe I have the drawings from the books too much in mind - but for me the wood should have been darker, more canopied and claustrophobic. More like being in a wardrobe in fact. And I never felt a sense of size about the wood, or indeed the rest of Narnia. I felt the camera stayed too close the action - and we needed some longer shots. Especially felt in the first meeting with Tumnus - which in other regards was very nearly magical.The battle at the end. Okay so the charge of the Riders of Rohan is perhaps the most impressive film image of our generation - but it's not really what Narnia is about. I craved for something a little smaller in scale - a little more personal and intimate.The waterfall/ ice flow scene. Utter nonsense and superfluous to a story that hardly lacks for dramatic drive. Why he didn't just follow the story as written Ill never understand. The wolves weren't sinister enough in looks either - although I have to admit the 'Jaws' moment with Edmund was suitably scary.The game of cricket and broken window episode. Again - the story as written with the escape from the visitors party and Mrs McCready was subtler and more interesting.Okay - enough gripes. By and large I did enjoy the film and I look forward to the next. I have concerns that as a book Prince Caspian (which I always felt was the weakest) may not support a very interesting movie. I hope that there is commitment to do all of the rest - or at least as far as Dawn Treader - which I think will make a fantastic vehicle for a film....","

If you read the book and are going to see the movie, you will not be disappointed. The movie was better than i expected actually. It's such an amazing and imaginative movie it's just enchanting. I wouldn't normally give any movie 10 stars, but i gave this one 10 stars out of 10. When i was watching the movie, and seeing all the sets and the props, i felt like i had already seen them before. Like they had taken them right out of my imagination when i was reading the book. I know not everyone will have this feeling, but i did, and it was magical. Even if you don't want to see this movie, go because it really is a spectacular and magical movie.","

"BabelAlexandria","5 September 2022","So says Mrs. Macready to the children, but thankfully they do not listen in the book, or in the movie, which is perhaps most notable for clinging so closely to the original. My kiddos and I have been enjoying the Narnia books over the past several months, and they are big fans of them; so they were naturally drawn to the movie too, which I hadn't seen before. Lucy steals the show in both media, and all of us thought she was the best acted; as the youngest, of course, she guides the others with her imagination, which is validated by ""the Professor"" before all four siblings take the plunge into the closet. Probably the most striking scene is not Aslan's death, but Lucy's initial encounter with the faun, Tumnus, in which not only the wonder between the two but also the tension and potential menace is given its space. In fact, the Christianizing elements which are often pointed out by Lewis's critics and supporters take a clear back seat in the movie, which instead chooses to go even further than the book in ""classicizing"" Narnia with figures from Greek mythology, from centaurs, griffons, and satyrs fighting for Peter to the minotaur general and cyclops fighting for the Ice Queen. Both my son and daughter pointed out that virtually the only added scenes were London being bombed, at the very beginning, and the parallel vision of griffons ""bombing"" the Queen's army with rocks before battle was engaged.","

"Dan1863Sickles","15 December 2005","So disappointing! I read this book as a child and I cherished every word of it. But the movie misses totally the magic that C.S. Lewis had in mind. There are a couple of nice touches at the beginning -- the eye opening shots of German bombers approaching the city, and the photograph of the father that Edmund tries to preserve. And a great song from the period, ""Oh! Johnny"" just as the magic is starting up.But the film makers just have no stomach for a real story arc for Edmund. They miss the central theme of sin and redemption. How can you have him saved if he can't be dark and nasty at the beginning? I can't believe how wimpy the film is, almost white washing Edmund, like he is in the wrong place at the wrong time, it's not his fault, and so forth. The Turkish Delight scene falls flat -- no sense of temptation, addiction, compulsion, just Edmund sort of flirting with a nice looking lady and walking off on his own power. And so many silly and pointless touches, like the dwarf jumping him with a knife, like a teen age delinquent in a James Dean movie! Now I want to say there are some nice performances -- Georgie Hensley is PERFECT as Lucy -- her reactions are always breath taking and magical. I wish I could see the movie she was ""reacting"" to -- you have to hand it to her for her innocence and freshness. And she and James McAvoy have totally natural chemistry -- the only thing the movie got right. And the young girl who plays Susan is perfectly cast, and going to be a real beauty in a couple of years. It's a shame the script makes her look like more of a whiner than Edmund! Whose bright idea was that? But all of that pales into insignificance compared to the bad battle scenes. My gosh, I have never seen a battle scene I didn't like -- till today. I can't believe how BORING this battle is. No sense of plans, or courage, or even coherent objectives. Animals we don't know running around in circles, fighting generic looking creepy crawlies, while the White Witch pouts and poses like a high fashion model! (You know it's bad when she's hotter than the battle raging all around her.) I thought Tilda Swinton made a lovely White Witch -- but she's badly lit in a lot of key scenes and seems pointlessly silly at times. (""Do you know what -- he betrayed you! For sweeties!"") All in all, this movie just wanders around, as if afraid to come down to brass tacks on who these children really are, and what they really suffer and what they learn.If there was a Christian agenda, it was bungled so badly that no one should be offended. And maybe that was just the point!","

Everything is believable, from the recreation of the Blitz, to the children themselves, to the Wardrobe (which looks exactly as I imagined it when I read the books so long ago!) and every facet of the recreation of Narnia, the landscape, the creatures, the White Witch, the Lion, the faun, and the Beavers!What an achievement. I was weeping with joy when it was over. I was so afraid that Lewis' gorgeous books, which mean so much more than they appear to on the surface, would be diminished by trying to make them into film, but they are enhanced. I want to go back and read them all again! And I can't wait for the next film!","

"Chris Knipp","29 December 2005","C.S. Lewis encouraged his friend Tolkien with his imaginative writing, but the favor was not returned. As his elaborate system in Lord of the Rings shows, Tolkien obviously liked to create a world that was an internally closed system. He didn't like the way Lewis worked in whatever familiar customs or myths fell to hand. Narnia most notably incorporates central aspects of Christianity; it's also a world where the children the stories are for enter the story, just as Lewis Carroll's pet child Alice Liddell enters his fantasy world in Through the Looking-Glass  in Narnia's case, obviously, through a wardrobe. Lewis's and Carroll's books also have in common talking animals, though the Narnia ones aren't as droll and crazy as the mathematician's. But Narnia is a wonderful story for children, because it has children who are real, but who become heroes.The first Narnia movie, directed by New Zealand visual effects and Shrek man Andrew Adamson, is perfect in its way. It's almost too perfect: you may wish somebody or something would stand out more. Maybe Tilda Swinton stands out a bit. Unless you recognize Jim Broadbent behind all his whiskers and makeup, Swinton is the only known actor we actually see on screen (Liam Neeson's voice is all too recognizable but it's attached to the Christlike lion, Aslan). Swinton blends in too, though. She's so sure and discreet  and so familiar these days as a wicked sprite (cp. her role in Constantine), even her presence may seem routine. She's even perfectly attired in changing outtits for each scene or season to help her blend in. But she deserves credit, as usual, for her integrity. She plays her role with absolute seriousness and poise. There's no cuteness about it.The children, Georgie Henley as Lucy, Skandar Keynes as Edmund, William Moseley as Peter, and Susan Prevensie as Anna Popplewell, a most carefully chosen quartet, are charming, distinctive, and very good actors. Somehow the boys seem to carry the action, while the girls carry the feeling.The movie is like a big beautiful toy box. The children and the animals come out and do their things, the white witch has her great battle with the forces of Aslan, and then they go away and we feel cozy and satisfied like a child who's been read to in bed and dozes off, dreaming of snow in a warm room.Like the classic Conrad Aiken short story ""Silent Snow, Secret Snow,"" the winter world of Narnia may grow out of a child's sense that snow is magical and unreal, beautiful but perilous. The snowy landscape of the film is enveloping and lovely, and it doesn't matter if it's real or not.People may take Aslan, the lion of God, differently, but nobody in his right mind can avoid the fact that what happens to him makes him like Christ and his slaughter like the Crucifixion, and his rising back to life off a big slab of stone that cracks like the Resurrection. And the two girls mourning over his body are the two Marys. And young Peter, the King and leader of the army of the good, is St. Peter, the founder of Christ's Church. C.S. Lewis was an adult convert whose enthusiasm for Christianity was so great he had to tell. But one can see Tolkien's point. This is what stands out: the Christian symbolism walks away with the story and spoils it a bit; Tolkien had a point.Or maybe it's that, seeing all these symbols in a movie simplified, reduced to music and visuals and the voice of Liam Neeson, no longer working solely through the supple language of C. S. Lewis, robs them of some of their original literary mystery and resonance. Once again the adaptation of a book into a film, while making it lovely and vivid for us, has diminished something that in words is accessible to all, more subtle and complex.The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a wonder, a delightful film, but it hasn't the visual richness of Lord of the Rings, nor has the story the complexity of Tolkien's elaborate mythology, or its immense variety, its real magic  though with the Harry Potter series running dry, it looks fresh. It's bright and shiny, like a Christmas tree ornament. It's a huge project nonetheless, as you see when you watch the credits of Narnia roll. Like Kill Bill's they go on so long the audience is long gone and the cleanup crew is well on its way to getting all the pop cups and corn bags and wrappers gathered up and the floor swept before the names have stopped scrolling. There are complete crews for Los Angeles, Czechoslovakia, Poland, New Zealand, Guatemala, and the San Francisco Bay Area, and special effects people for each location. I wonder what an Oxford don would have made of all that.Tilda Swinton is the best androgynous sprite ever, but it's time (here's a plug for the small project) for her to do more roles like the needy mother in Mike Mills's Thumbsucker. She may have taken home a smaller paycheck, but she delivered way more humanity. As for the great battles in The Chronicles of Narnia, they fade quickly from the mind. Better than anything else are the tender early scenes between Mr. Tumnus, the fawn (James McAvoy), and young Lucy. Those who know the book much better than I do tend to say the first part of it is the best. The battle of good and evil may be too much to take in on first viewing, and may sink in when the other parts come out. This is not a great film, but it's impeccable. And the early scenes will stay in the mind a long time. _________________","

"zoe-girl-32","15 July 2006","The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was based off of an already popular and compelling story. Some people don't know that the Chronicles of Narnia is allegorical and The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was based off the crucifixion. this only makes the story more realistic and fascinating as the Director (Andrew Adamson) takes C.S. Lewis's incredible world and adapts it to screen for all the world to see. the story focuses on four children who find their way into a magical world called Narnia where animals talk and thins like unicorns and nymphs and mermaids are real. it sounds simplistic but there is another twist to this world. eternal winter seems consume what was once a beautiful country. this winter is because of a witch (Tilda Swinton) who has Narnia under her rain. but when the Pevensies, Peter (William Mosely), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley) come to this world, they discover the truth about a lion called Aslan (Liam Neeson) who is the real King of Narnia. one might expect a silly story about kids who talk to animals and fairies and learn lessons and stuff like that, but the story is so much more intricate and spectacular. more than just a 'good story'. it's a one of a kind adventure. I give this movie ten.","

"Elori","4 January 2006","Narnia isn't the next Lord of the Rings, nor the next Harry Potter, at least on the cinema screen. Even what spirit those fantasy spectacles had, Narnia lacks. And it seems the whole hundreds-plus audience, many of whom were children, agreed with me in their numb, passive state. No yelps of joy, excitement nor even the slightest scare. After the movie ended, both kids and adults were in such a rush to leave, silent and obviously underwhelmed, that some of them missed the tacked-in ending during the credits.Visually, the movie is a quality work, displaying technical prowess and craftsmanship. You will wonder how they managed to create all beasts from the real world to the mythology, from beavers, panthers and lions to fauns, centaurs and gryphons. There are also some large, captivating sights such as the view of the ice castle and the scene of the final battle. The snow is dubious though, but I guess that is acceptable.What is not acceptable is the soullessness and joylessness of the rest of actual content of the film. Much of it weighs down upon the main roles the main roles. Georgie Henley's Lucy Pevensie gets a lot of screen time compared to her siblings, which is for the better thanks to her charisma. The rest of three, however, come off as stiff and unnatural, with perhaps more fault to the script and directing than the actors themselves. The children are portrayed as precocious on some occasions, yet unbelievably daft on others. Due to this, the three eldest siblings are thrown quite off balance during the film, and not in the credible way of children, but rather for the goal-oriented purposes of trying to build up suspense and plot where there is none.Maybe the producers have tried to make a child-centered movie by explaining the obvious, but it feels more like underestimating its young viewers. On the other hand, the deeper questions are left completely unattended, such as the nature of the Great Magic, and the importance of Humans. This leaves the story empty, and creates a soft of befuddlement over the whole movie: what was all the fighting about? Why were the good creatures good and the bad creatures not? Underneath its eye candy, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is hollow, and without a soul, the exterior fails to impress alone.","

"ociopia","17 December 2005","I went with trepidations, figuring Tilda Swinton would be wonderful and the rest would be so-so. I was delighted to be wrong. The movie really hinges on the four children, they are the center. I thought it was extremely well-cast and acted. I can't remember the actors names but Lucy is enchanting, Peter is noble, Susan is a difficult role as the practical, spoil-sport so I can't say she was marvelous, but really Edmund is where everything revolves.This Edmund was really great. I was able to care about him and hope for him in a way I never did in the book. Kudos to the kids.In the book, Mr. Tumnus was pivotal, even if briefly seen, and the movie's Mr. Tumnus was delightfully sweet and touching. There's a special scene between he and Lucy that is inventive and wonderful.Aslan - impossible really to capture as he is a concept. I felt the facial expression was so true to the sense of sorrow that Aslan carries but I was not fond of Liam Neesan's voice. Somehow that did not work for me, nor did the voice of the wolf.But Aslan does convey goodness and it's transitory nature and the end brought that home so well. While many seem to believe this is a Christian-themed movie, I think whatever you believe will work because the themes of good and evil, nobility and sacrifice are universal and symbolic.A beautiful movie that I highly recommend to those who love adventure, fantasy and myth.","

"bob9354","18 December 2005","I very much enjoyed this movie. It helped that my 22 year old daughter saw it first. She's an avid C.S. Lewis fan and expressed disappointment that the magic of his writing wasn't captured by the film. So I was prepared to be disappointed, which for me is a good thing. I hate having movies over-hyped...it seems they never live up to it. I agree with my daughter by the way. It would be very difficult to capture Lewis' magic from any of his books. It would have to be done in the dialogue if anywhere. But, like Lord of the Rings, I was able to put my memory of the book aside and enjoy the movie for what it was. I would have liked to have seen the majesty and omniscience of Aslan better displayed. He almost seemed to be too much a creature and not who he really represented. I would also have liked to see more development of the relationships between the kids and Aslan as happened in the book. But all in all, very good. I'd give it an 8.8","

"bkoganbing","7 January 2006","There's one good rule about the writing of children's stories, that you should never treat children like children. I believe that is the reason for the success of C.S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia down through the years. And it's the reason for the success of this film, sure to take home some Oscar gold this year for special effects if nothing else.Before writing this review I did a little research on C.S. Lewis. I found that he had started writing this first story of the Narnia Chronicles during World War II. Lots of British families did like the Pevensies, ship their kids to the country side to escape the bombing of cities. They sent them abroad if they could afford to. What Lewis did was bring his Christian background and a vivid imagination in creating an escapist world for four kids who were in an unfamiliar area in the first place. These kids faced the real prospect of losing one or more parents and siblings. Enough of them did.Like American kids grow up on cowboys and Indians, British kids grow up on Knights of the Round Table and Robin Hood. Add some animals who all have the souls of humans, some mythical creatures, a wicked witch, and the King of Beasts and put these four Pevensie kids through a magic door and you've got Narnia.By the way I don't think it's an accident that Aslan, the Christ figure in the film is a lion. Remember the British national symbol is also a lion. Lewis didn't have the saviour of the kingdom be a Russian bear or an American bald eagle.I'm also sure that the success of the first book had a lot to do with the fact that it was published in 1950 at the height of the Cold War which a lot of people thought could get hot any minute. Parents wanted escapist stuff for their kids and for themselves as well. I'll bet reading all The Chronicles of Narnia was a secret pleasure.I think this film will be a guilty pleasure for a lot of folks.","

Lewis and have loved this book. The movie didn't disappoint at all. The story is accurately told of little Lucy stumbling into Narnia and changing their world for the better. More importantly, it is a reminder to us that the simplest of good deeds can change our world for the better.On a technical note, the special effects in the movie could have been better, but when you consider that this is basically a children's story and children aren't as critical as adults, they are fine. As I have said before, one must suspend their disbelief and enjoy the movie for the movie.","

I have no clue (or maybe I'm just stupid) why I chose to buy that because I remember reading the book about a few months before this came out and kept thinking she was the ""nice"" person. And to say when I read this, I hated it.The actors were wonderful. Georgie cracks me up on the commentary, Skandar I just love, Anna's like the girl who's the older sister, and Willam is the older brother/boy everyone loves.

"claudio_carvalho","30 July 2006","In the World War II, four children are sent by their mother to the countryside to escape from the bombing of London. While living in the old house of Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent), the young Lucy Pevensie (Georgie Henley) finds a passage to a magic frozen kingdom, ruled by an evil witch, White Witch (Tilda Swinton), through a wardrobe. When her two brothers, Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keynes) and Peter Pevensie (William Moseley), and her older sister Susan Pevensie (Anna Popplewell), cross the passage to Narnia, a prophecy is fulfilled and the rebel forces leaded by the lion Aslan and Peter fight against the evil witch.""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is a good story, where moral values of honesty, loyalty, sacrifice, freedom, friendship and love battle and win dishonesty, betrayal, selfishness, tyranny, betrayal and hate. The special effects are amazing, with the most weird creatures. Unfortunately the young Georgie Henley is too weak for the lead and very important role of Lucy, wasting many scenes with her constant smile. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""As Crônicas de Nárnia: O Leão, A Feiticeira e o Armário"" (""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"")","

"sweet_cuppin_cakes","9 December 2005","Though this movie is perfect for all audiences, fans of the book will be especially pleased. Nothing is omitted. The embellishments are minor, and added strictly for the purpose of lengthening the movie (the book is really quite short).The battle scenes are fantastic. Gorgeous, even, and rivaling the greatest modern movie war sequences, without being excessively gory or graphic.I just finished re-reading the book to compare the movie with it. Though the film is considerably darker, it remains an endearing and fantastic adventure for audiences of all ages.Treat yourself to this lovely piece of cinema. You will cherish your experience.","

"mls-11","12 December 2005","I often read postings from movie-goers who rail on and on about ""the best movie ever."" Far more often than not, they are films of little depth, thin stories, and little artistic value.Tonight, my wife and I saw ""Narnia"" and were absolutely bowled over. This is a story - a portrayal - a delivery - that is simply overwhelming. A film of over 2 hours in length seemed to fly by. The actors - unknown to us - were delightful. Of particular note is the young person playing ""Lucy."" She is captivating - in face and charm. She carried her role very nicely, and worked well with her peers.Special effects were wonderful in animal and human form - as well as the semi-humans. And, let us not forget The Beavers - tried very hard to steal the show, and almost succeeded.There was a primary hero, but several more supporting heroes. And, much to our delight, there was a villain that we REALLY wanted to ""boo."" I don't believe we overstate our position when we cast our vote for Film of the Year for ""Narnia."" Go see it, and enjoy.","

"drednm","14 April 2006","Interminable twaddle from the overrated CS Lewis book has 4 snotty kids finding another world full of talking beavers at the back end of a wardrobe. YAWN. All the same old crap over and over again with beasties fighting in an endless computer-generated battle scene. Nothing new. Same old thing we've seen in dozens of other movies. Tilda Swinton and Jim Broadbent are trapped in this puke.The kids are obnoxious as they act out the proper little British children fantasies until you scream at the screen for them to DIE, especially the ugly girl with the big lips.A total pukefest from the very start to the end, seemingly 5 hours later. A complete waste of time, money, and effort.","

"CharlesHogge-1","13 December 2005","I am, by nature, wary of any film that relies upon children to play the lead roles. I have avoided the Harry Potter films like the plague, working on the (frequently reinforced) principal that no film ever manages to get close to as good as my imagination. At long last I have had that theory disproved. I have just spent the last 2 hours sitting in the cinema with a massive smile in my face (with occasional grimaces as the idiot sitting next to me insisted on talking to his girlfriend. I think there should be some kind of panic button that gets the ushers running in with night-sticks to sort these muppets out). Having spent the last 2 months trying to get a job it was the most amazing experience to rewind the clock by 15 years and feel the rush of wonder and awe as the magical world of Narnia sprung to life on the big screen. The casting crew did a fantastic job, with practically every character looking and acting exactly as I had imagined them since I was a child. Once again New Zealand came up trumps, and the splendour of the scenery perfectly complimented the fantasy of the story.I've never felt compelled to write a commentary on this site before, but I was so relieved and enchanted by this film that I couldn't help but try to spread the word.Sit back, relax and let yourself be taken back to the magic and and excitement of your childhood.","

"MovieFanGuyy","1 December 2005","Disney's highly anticipated Chronicles of Narnia, has several decades worth of fans who are waiting eagerly for this adaptation.My friends, the hype is definitely worth it, the story, the acting, the visual effects, all marvelous.Narnia, as many people know concerns four small children who take up shelter in a professor's house.While playing hide and seek, one of the children, Lucy, stumbles upon an old wardrobe in the professor's house. That wardrobe leads to the magical world of Narnia.From there the four children take on an adventure of epic proportions, with talking animals, and all sorts of fantasy creatures.This is what each of the four Harry Potter movies have each wanted to be so far, and failed to do! Truly magical and one of the very best films of 2005, highly recommended! If you see this film, see it on the very best screen, because the sound and visual effects are truly spectacular! Narnia will surely become a box office smash for Disney, opening the door for more of the books to be filmed!Three and a half stars out of four! Here comes Oscar nominations!Winner of the 2005 Academy Award for Best Make Up.","

"BaronBl00d","29 December 2005","A truly inventive, oft times breathtaking journey into the fertile mind of C. S. Lewis. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is refreshing; it tells a ""simple"" story in a simple manner yet is anything but simple. Four siblings need to be placed in a home during the blitz in WWII and come to the huge manse of one Professor Kirke. There they find a huge wardrobe which sometimes acts as a portal to another world. I never read these books as a child but will go back and read them now. The story is allegorical and symbolic to be sure, but for those of you that do not want to be bogged down with that - have no fear it isn't needed at all to enjoy this. The rest of the story takes on a Lord of the Rings scope as good vs. evil in the form of the four youngsters(now in a mythical world called Narnia) and aided by Aslan a giant of a lion fight the wicked White Witch and her evil minions for supremacy. Director Andrew Adamson, also from New Zealand(like Peter Jackson), is able to pull off much in this his first full-scale non-animation film. Previously he directed both Shrek films. Adamson hits a couple of slow patches early on but his world that he created comes bursting to life on the screen with vibrant colors and weird, fairly believable characters. There are many weird creatures such as a centaur, a pair of cockney-speaking beavers, and a pack of deadly wolves. The film ends with a typical battle scene but that is done rather well at any rate. What makes this film work besides the energetic direction and the imaginative script is the acting. The four children all do a reasonably good job: a must when having youngsters perform as protagonists. None of them is particularly detrimental. The young girl playing Lucy is particularly good. Liam Neeson lends his mighty voice to the Lion - a feat of filming. The two digitally created beavers are also most impressive and bring lots of subtle laughs to the proceedings. But the real star if you will is Tilda Swinton giving lessons on how to be wicked and look as pale as ever. Swinton plays evil almost too well. Jim Broadbent plays the professor and even though his role is minor, his presence is necessary. A very good film.","

"PinkPurple","11 December 2005","I'd say it got almost everything right. Of course nothings perfect But all they really had to get right was being faithful enough to capture the essence of the story, most importantly it's sense of heart, which it does well enough. These characters had a hell of a lot more going for them in the rooting department than most more morden movies of these recent years and it carry's the movie and any flaws through. If they'd tried to attempt anymore then they'd have entered the ""trying to please everyone"" zone of impossibility.Somehow I found both the personality trates in Peter and Edmund and their character arcs rang true. Edmund's selfishness, the little brother who can't seem to do anything right, who must learn the error of his ways by bitter experience, forced to grow up fast and Peter's struggle to live up to his responsibilities, the boy forced to be something that he isn't certain he can be, the boy who must become the man of the family. I understand how that stuff must feel rather well. Each felt very natural, clearly the makers worked hard to get such performances out of these youngsters. I hear they even deliberately looked for kids who matched the character's persona's which obviously helped.I liked that nobody was just morphed into a mighty hero, that they remained consistently grounded and humanised. Peter not loosing his sense of humour. I loved how the actor delivered his reply to ""They come in numbers far greater than our own,"" ""Numbers don't win a war"" with simply a ""No...but I bet they help."" I'm very warm to the underdog hero who faces insane odds and who can laugh at them self and use humour as a defence no matter how grave the situation.Perhaps the only slight criticism is that the girls on the other hand were somewhat more underused, well the older one anyway. Lucy was note worthy.The voice work guys played an absolute blinder! Ray Winston ruled! That cranky little East-End beaver nearly stole the show! Dawn French served her purpose well as a good compliment to the great Ray.Aslan the mighty wise old Lion didn't disappoint me either, he looked magnificent and voiced to a tea by the master of such roles, the legendary Liam Neeson. Ah the wonders of the CGI age eh? The Villain front didn't let the side down neither. I digged the taunting wolf, always great tension when a Villain knows how to mess with the heroes insecurities, especially when it's the best kind of hero, a humanised underdog kind of hero like Peter, whom is bursting with that kind of vulnerability. This lead to some fairly decent built up tenstion and suspense. That was one creepy as hell White Witch, those eyes, it was all in the eyes and of course her shining moment came in that one all important scene, the scene that if they'd got wrong, the hole movie would have fell to pieces, yep the infamous stone table scene. And boy was it powerful stuff, no easy feat considering it was a puppet! It's A PUPPET!... oh sorry, no I wasn't possessed by British comedian Brian Conery for a moment there, I was checking your paying attenstion and of course mean't...puppet/CGI Lion.All in all, a film thats refreshingly as character driven as possible for a big epic blockbuster.","

"skotoparavich","10 December 2005","I usually do not take the time to write reviews for films. I have not liked one for long time. So I went to the theater with the following expectations: Yes the graphics will be great. However, I had low expectations for the acting and plot. I had no clue what will the directing, music, sound effects, and picture will be like. I believe my expectations were clearly justifiable since I have read the book, I have seen the BBC version, and we all know about the deficiencies of remakes. The following were my impressions after I have seen the movie: I loved the Movie. It exceeded all my expectations. The acting was excellent; then I realized that Aslan's voice was performed by Liam Neelsen. How can you go wrong with that? The children actors in the BBC version were very good. They raised the bar for any remake. But the actors in this movie were excellent, especially Lucy and Edmond. The Music is fabulous and the picture is one of the best. The battle scenes are beautiful and the graphics are wonderful. The supporting actors are all good. I was very surprised that the movie was very faithful to the book. The author plot and intention was the heart of the movie. I really thought that C.S. Lewis was actually the director. One more observation, the movie was so entertaining and every scene was so beautiful, I left that movie hoping for the second and the third part.I watched lot of movies and if there is one I recommend you see in the theater for the last one year, it is this one. It is one movie which teens will love, children will adore, parents will adore, and Single Adults will want to watch again.","

As an adult I found it exciting to watch with times of tension and anticipation, and yet I can't wait to take my two young children. This is the best adaptation of ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" yet, and while that may not say much let me add C.S. Lewis would be proud.

"Bachfeuer","10 December 2005","It has been a long time since I found a fantasy film with a lot of special effects so satisfying as ""Narnia."" It is exquisitely crafted, visually gorgeous, has some fine performances, and itlike the underlying materialis more challenging than Harry Potter and more interesting than Tolkien.There is huge irony and hypocrisy to the embrace of ""Narnia"" by the same conservative Christians who would burn Harry Potter at the stake for witchcraft. The free mixture of some Christian symbolism with the CelticPaganfairy world ought to offend them just as much. Doing a talking lion to death on a Druid altar and then bringing him back to life is not the same thing as the resurrection, after all. By their lights, that fairy world is demonic, and the premise is abominable heresy. It would seem that fundamentalist Christians embrace C.S. Lewis because doing so is good for wedge-issue politics.I'm afraid that backlash from the studio's misrepresentation of ""Narnia"" as some sort of bitter, right-wing medicine like ""The Passion of the Christ"" will deny it some of the popular success it deserves.","

"ferguson-6","10 December 2005","Greetings again from the darkness. How wonderful to see a family action/adventure that makes sense to those of us who have not contributed to J.K. Rowling's enormous fortune. Director Andrew Adamson (of ""Shrek"" and ""Shrek 2"" fame) brings to life the enormously popular stories of C.S. Lewis. ""Narnia"" is a thrilling ride with a story, a message and some amazing characters and action.From a technical standpoint the battle scene challenges most anything accomplished in the ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Harry Potter"" movies. The effects make me believe this is what legendary effects specialist Ray Harryhausen envisioned as he worked his magic in the ""Sinbad"" movies and later in ""Clash of the Titans"".Lewis did little to hide the biblical allegory, going as far as calling the 4 children of the prophecy the children of Adam. Good versus evil, sacrifice for the good of others and the confused doubter all play a part in the story. It is, however, initially a bit off-setting to experience talking beavers and wolves and a sly, deceitful fox. The impact is that we care very much for the characters and their desire and reluctance to do the right (and courageous) things.The four children are all pretty much unknown to American audiences and newcomer Georgie Henley is marvelous as bright-eyed Lucy Pevensie. She is the heart of the film and of the family. Tilda Swinton is perfect as the White Witch. She is a real life Cruella Deville on steroids. She has the icy stare and cut features that Adamson's first choice Michelle Pfeiffer lacks. We really dislike her ... and that's a good thing!! Liam Neeson was brought in to replace Brian Cox as the voice of the majestic Aslan, and a better choice is difficult to imagine. Other voices that stand out are Dawn French and Ray Winstone as Mrs. and Mr. Beaver and Rupert Everett as the fox.Parents be warned that the battle scene is very intense and some of the visuals will frighten the youngest viewers. On the bright side, most adults will enjoy the film every bit as much as the kids in the audience. Now will someone please figure out a way to make C.S. Lewis' ""The Screwtape Letters"" into a film?","

"zkonedog","4 March 2017","When I first saw ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" in theaters, I left with a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth. The reason? At the time, I couldn't help but comparing it to the ""Lord of the Rings"" series. However, after reading Tolkien's classic novel again and then re-re-watching this movie, I can now see it as a great adaptation that is very true to the source material.For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of the Pevensie family siblings, who are shipped off into the English countryside to avoid the carnage of WWII. While at the mansion of their eccentric uncle, they find a wardrobe that mysterious leads to another world called Narnia. Little Lucy (Georgia Henley) goes in first and meets a Faun named Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy). Then Edmund (Skandar Keynes) stumbles in and meets a much more nefarious personality...the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), self-proclaimed ""Queen of Narnia"". Later on, older siblings Susan (Anna Popplewell) and Peter (William Moseley) discover Narnia and find themselves in a conflict that they themselves have been deeply prophesized within.The Narnia books were made for children (but well-written enough for adults to enjoy the experience), and that is exactly what this movie is like. If you try (like I once did) to compare it to LOTR, it will never measure up because you are not comparing like quantities. LOTR is an epic drama, while the Chronicles are a lighter-hearted children's drama. This film really captures that spirit, what with the great special effects, the sibling interplay, and just the general whimsical- ness of the overall production. It's ""played straight"", don't get me wrong, but there is a lot of fun involved too.What might just stand out the most, though, is the acting. Little Georgia as Lucy almost steals the show at some points with her incredible emotional range for such a young child, while Skandar's Edmund is spot-on as the mischievous Edmund (a character who is so important in showing that even in Narnia it can be difficult to tell the good from the bad sometimes). Also, casting Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan, the true ruler of Narnia, was a stroke of genius. Each time the great lion speaks, it will send chills down your spine.So, even though I didn't fully appreciate this movie when it first came out, I can now see it as a faithful adaptation to its source novel. Both mediums are meant for children and not to be compared to older, more adult fare. I don't know of a child alive who wouldn't be captivated by this movie, and I'm sure that's just the way C.S. Lewis would have wanted it.","

"funkyfry","2 August 2006","I highly approve of this fantasy film for young people, and would also recommend it to older fantasy fans with fond memories of C.S. Lewis' memorable series. However, I would urge parents to keep kids under the age of 8 away as the film has some complex themes and a lot of violence.As a long-time fan of the Narnia books, I was as usual expecting to be under-whelmed by this film from the director of ""Shrek"", a film I really did not enjoy. But the film is beautifully photographed and is more original and enjoyable than the Harry Potter films, though it is not quite as good as ""Lord of the Rings"". The child actors, first of all, were astounding. And if you have seen a lot of movies with child actors you know what I mean. Usually they are just ciphers, they just represent something for the adult characters to defend and love. But this film is really about the children, and the director has managed to get performances out of the children that are truly nuanced and alive.The sense of the fantasy world itself is very fulfilling. This is a film that satisfies the requirements for a faerie tale, and I enjoyed the way the movie used the idea of having Lucy go in first, then Edmund, and finally all 4 children. It really made the contrast between the faerie and the human worlds vivid. The audience is with Lucy 100% and so through her we experience the resistance that ""reality"" presents when faced with the fey, which is one of the central themes in quality fantasy literature/film (see also ""Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" for example, or the novel ""Don Quixote""). Then when Edmund denies having been there when the audience knows he ""really"" was, it introduces the aspects of his character that are less than admirable in a believable way, which makes it easier for us to understand why he does side with the White Witch at first.Speaking of the White Witch, I have to say Tilda Swinton makes this movie worthwhile even if there were nothing else in the film. She is one of the best female villains I have ever seen in a film. If people want to make comparisons to the classic Margaret Hamilton performance in ""The Wizard of Oz"", it wouldn't be too far out of line. Truly inspired work, she becomes more and more ferocious as she goes on. Unfortunately I don't really think they captured the sense that she was seductive in her early scenes with Edmund, and other than his jealous personality it's somewhat hard to imagine Edmund siding with her instead of being creeped out by her. I don't think that was so much Swinton's fault as how she was directed. This is a very good film but it lacks subtlety on certain levels.But a fantasy movie doesn't have to be subtle to be great. This film in its best moments truly soars. Aslan's death is handled very well, the scene is appropriately disgusting and the girls' lamentation convincing. Aside from the issue of timing (how did Asland manage to be resurrected, travel across Narnia to the White Witch's castle, breathe on all the frozen soldiers, and then get that army to the fields, all while the battle was taking place?) it is quite effective. The big battle at the end feels a bit too ""LOTR"", but the minotaurs make a scary opponent and Swinton really pours gas on the fire in that scene. The early scenes with Lucy in the forest with the fawn are perfect. You get that sense of menace from the fawn without any of the ugly implications that might have come with it.Only minor complaints -- I thought the badger couple had a bit too much of the ""shrek"" cheeziness in them, and it was inappropriate for mr. badger to call the kid a ""blighter"". I also thought the ""Father Christmas"" segment was a bit on the cheezy side. But it does serve its function in the story.Another aspect of the film which should be commented on is the perfect balance it achieves between allegory and pure fantasy. The film-makers could have chosen to emphasize the religious allegory more, or they could have done some changes in the story to make it even less apparent, but I think they chose wisely to more or less adapt the story exactly how Lewis had done it, which is to leave the allegory in the open but not to push it in anyone's face. That is a harder balance to reach than it might seem and the film-makers should be praised for succeeding.","

"astro_92","10 December 2005","I went to go see this movie last night and I must say that I was very pleased with what I witnessed. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a fun-filled motion picture that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This film also contains a few good laughs as well. This likable adventure has vast diversity when it comes to its principal characters. The intensity contained here is very overwhelming. The four central protagonists are all very charming indeed.Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are trying to adapt to their new living arrangement when they discover a magical wardrobe in a secret room in the upstairs area. The quartet meets a wide variety of good and evil characters. They gradually realize that the land of Narnia is in danger because of the evil White Witch, who claims to be the queen of the land. Some friendly animals soon tell the children that they are the only hope in ending the witch's reign of terror. A lion named Aslan is brought to their attention and they prepare for a magnificent battle. The lion ends up killing the evil witch. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are all honored and crowned as monarchs in the land of Narnia. The story here comes to a very happy end.I truly like this movie and its characters. The four kids are, once again, very charming. Peter, the oldest son, is very strong-willed and reliable. Susan, the oldest daughter, has a genuinely delightful personality in addition to her ability to provide help to others when it is needed. Edmund likes to go his own way in a situation when he feels that it is a necessity; therefore, he is something of a rebel. Lucy is an adorable little girl who has a way with making others happy with her cute smile; she is also a bit of a humanitarian. The sadistic White Witch has a huge love of telling others what to do. When the lion killed her, I got very ecstatic. Peace was restored to the land of Narnia and our heroes are greatly honored.I love this movie! The characters here really captivated me, especially Susan and Lucy, the two lovable girls. The classic story by C.S. Lewis is brought to life in a truly spectacular way. Families everywhere will fall in love with this masterpiece of a motion picture. Long live King Peter, Queen Susan, King Edmund, and Queen Lucy!","

"DublinUF","10 December 2005","To see this movie brought to life so fully brings a joy to my heart. As a long time fan of the series, I was worried about how this film was going to be portrayed, but they absolutely nailed it.When they veered from the book, it only was to enhance the tension at certain plot points, never to change the essence of the story.Of course, the goal of a good movie isn't only to follow the plot of the movie. It's to make an exciting movie experience. In this case, it was also important not to violate the spirit of the book. Adam Adamson didn't.Perhaps the most brilliant decision he made was to cast four unknowns as the Pevensie children. They prove unequivocally that level of fame coming in is not synonymous with talent. These children give the movie, and their characters, extreme depth. At its core, The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is the story of how these four children grow into their destiny. This movie nails that.By succeeding overwhelmingly in constructing the movie's core, Adamson satisfies his core audience. Which is why it is so easy to accept the other slight changes from the book -- there is a certain trust that any changes will be made by someone who is in tune with C.S. Lewis' spirit and vision.In a pre-CGI world, Lewis once said that he couldn't envision a live-action Narnia movie that worked. Thanks to Adam Adamson the rest of us can.","

"tastyhotdogs","28 December 2005","Haven't read the book of this but saw an animated version many years ago. I was blown away by this adaption.The story follows a family of 4 children, sent away by their mother to live with a professor away from the war zone that threatened their lives. The house is pretty sterile, the professor stand-offish and it seems the kids will be bored out of their brains. While in the middle of a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy, the youngest child (and star of the movie), stumbles across a wardrobe that leads somehow into the magical land of Narnia. When Lucy returns and retells her adventure, everyone thinks she is crazy, but eventually they discover Narnia exists. As they check out Narnia, they become caught up in a battle. You'll need to see it to find out more.The movie is an adaption of the CS Lewis classic. The movie version, due to Disney's brilliance, brings great power and passion to Lewis's story and I'm pretty sure he'd be happy with the portrayal. Many may not know that the message behind the story is the message of Jesus, portrayed through Aslan. It shows us the purpose of Jesus' life- to die as a sacrifice for others. The story also features many themes close to Lewis' heart- forgiveness, redemption, the search for truth.Excellent movie for the kids- there are a few scary scenes with some animals and some battles, but most kids 7+ should be fine. Excellent effects too.","

"tedg","15 December 2005","Writing about big movies like this is a real pleasure because you can assume that the reader has already been exposed to the mainstream opinions and obvious controversies. So one can focus on other, perhaps more interesting issues.I was never a fan of Lewis' romantic Christianity and his allegorical crusade, not with the genius of ""Alice in Wonderland"" as the benchmark. Or the King Arthur stories. But I have to admit that while I found his written tale dull as Oxford dust, his storytelling ability had magic, and that was what made the thing fun for many. That business about the narrator being explicit and commenting on what is happening is lost in the two movies.Oh, I should say that you really should see the 88 BBC version first. It was both cheaper and more magical. It had much better kids except for the young girl. Neither production gave us an awareness of the powers of the Queen (except via wand), so that power had to be carried by intensity. Therefore, the screaming queen of 1988 fit better into the dynamics of the world.If you do see the 1988 version, it will remind you how artless this modern one is. I'd say about a quarter of the shots in this new one are almost perfect copies from the older. Look at really great productions; ""Aliens"" comes to mind, and you will note that there is not a single interesting design in this whole thing. Every shot, every character (mostly dumb rubber masks in queen associates) every character action is from the third bin down in familiarity. That is, except Tilda.Magic should be in the way the thing is portrayed. Nothing here seems magical at all, nothing like ""Time Bandits"" for instance, or a few of the better parts of ""Lord or the Rings."" The sets were dull, the magical places ordinary.I am an admirer of Tilda. I'll see anything she is in and expect to enjoy it. She did have a captivating sequence here in the final battle, but it was ruined in a way by the dreadfully staged ""stone table"" sequence before. Straight out of a 40s cannibal movie, with a set so cheesy and artless it made me squirm. No Baz Luhrman here.Here's the thing. Tilda knows a whole lot more about what works and what doesn't than the director. So she's created her own character in his vacuum, her own wardrobe and makeup. Some of that is great, but it doesn't fit anything, not the book, and not the lumpy director's vision, or what it seems to be.So what you end up with that's positive, is an appealing young girl, an amazing witch in the battle scene, and one extremely nice cinematic effect. It was so good it made everything else seem cinematically unimaginative. This was when Lucy pulled the sheet off the wardrobe to reveal the tree carving (Alice again!). The dramatic movement of that drape was wonderful, just wonderful. It was featured in the trailer. Then you got Lucy's gaze for the first time, one that is repeated tiresomely thereafter.That this wonderful bit of magic came and went before Narnia appears made me look in vain for more.(There's another scene that could have been great. While Lucy is being hypnotized, virtual satyrs dance in the fireplace, a sort of dream within the vision within the movie. Another director might have implied what Lewis does, that everything that follows could be Lucy's Dream.)Oh, there's one overt decision the director made. A sad one. He decided to play up the Nazi angle. So we have that incongruous bombing sequence where the Germans look like monsters. This gave Tilda her cue to have an Aryan look and movieland Nazi coldness.What follows is an intrusion of the American battle narrative on the original British one: war is depicted as inherently vile at the beginning up until Santa Claus becomes an arms merchant. Thereafter it is depicted as glorious, with the girls now involved as warriors. The shift is that Christians are battling evildoers, you see. Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.","

"exquire","8 December 2005","With all the pseudo-Gothic dark, twisted and ""scary"" fantasy flicks now on offer, it's a refreshing and welcome change to have the fun magical brand of Andrew Adamson come to a live action realisation.And the first installment Narnia is all the twinkling eyed New Zealand director (do we know any other people like that?) could have hoped for in the bid to revive the imaginations of the many so that the Hollywood of the future can make movies and games out of original material.Narnia unashamedly re-kindles the romance so many have with the fantastical, taking us through the wardrobe in our minds and into an endless and wonderful place. That place is luscious and vivid with colour. It's inhabited by the bubbly, the wise and noble, and even the evil and sinister.There exists everything from our imagination--Spoilers from here on--From talking animals to completely imaginary ones. A Santa Clause who hands out lethal weapons made by Weta Workshop. Fauns, centaurs and cyclops warriors. Massive battles where polar bears and big cats and minotaurs fight against each other.Oh but not a drop of blood! It's a family movie with Disney writing the cheques, but the rating does not come at a cost to the action, rest assured. The film will appeal to a wide audience, and deserves it too. Thankfully, it's done with such delightful escapism that whoever watches it is magically transformed into a child. A child that still understands the generous helping of adult-aimed jokes in the side-comments, that is.This movie will get compared to others of its type, which is only partly fair. I'll try it in brief: LOTR: OK, it's like LOTR for kids and anyone who wants the fantasy experience without a massive and serious emotional bond to the characters. Harry Potter: Potter fans who scream endlessly for ""darker"" films would do well to be reminded that colourful fantasy is a wonderful thing. This is just the ticket. Oh, and it has a plot other than ""time passes and not much of any consequence happens."" Shrek: This would be a good comparison. Narnia is certainly more serious, but Shrek's youngest fans will have a new favourite movie.It's understatement to say Adamson's visionary film does the book justice.Narnia exists!","

I remember the story (sort of) from the animated version, but this movie captures the all the beauty and evil and heart and soul of Narnia and its magnificent leader, Aslan. The CGI is seamless, Tilda Swinton is awesome, the children are terrific, and the Beavers are, well, Beavers. Allegory or not, dream-state or not, whatever Lewis had in mind, the story is wonderfulI mean, who wouldn't want to go to Narnia?

"DICK STEEL","12 December 2005","This is one of seven books by CS Lewis on the fantasy world of Narnia. My earliest recall of the story was an animated cartoon, where 4 children chanced upon a wardrobe which transported them to a medieval-fantasy ice world ruled by an evil witch.The introductory scene might confuse audiences that their watching Band of Brothers, though the German blitz over London is a sight to behold. Father Pevensie has gone off to fight in the war, and Mother Pevensie decided to pack the 4 Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, to the countryside to seek safe havens. They get to live with Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent in an extremely underutilized role), and the youngest of them all, Lucy, discovers the Wardrobe in one of the mansion's rooms.The children bicker a lot, and through their Narnia adventures, learn about the importance of family and cooperation. Disbelieving Lucy at first, the rest got introduced to the wardrobe soon enough, and thus begin their stay in Narnia only after an hour into the movie (Yes, it takes that long before something decent happens on screen). Put under an icy curse, Narnia awaits the arrival of 2 sons of Adam and 2 daughters of Eve to deliver it from the clutches of the evil White Witch (Tilda Swindon, perhaps the only human form in Narnia).But first, the children have to learn to make sense of the gifts bestowed upon them by Father Christmas, as well as to seek out Aslan, the mystical (speaking) lion, voiced by the regal Liam Neeson, in yet another mentor-like role after this years Kingdom of Heaven and Batman Begins. Yes, he's a good choice, but used too often it becomes deja-vu.The talking animals became the talk of the town amongst some critical circles, but I say, give it a break. There are talking lions, beavers, wolves, foxes, etc, whose lips move in sync with their impeccable English, that I'm sure will sell many merchandise, probably soft toys.While the cinematography is beautiful, somehow, familiarity with the source material brought about a monotone feel to the narrative. You'd know what will happen next, and the way this movie is delivered, there isn't much of a crescendo or scenes to excite. Shrek director Andrew Adamson should have known better, but opted for the safe and boring route.The acting by the animals surpassed their human counterparts. The four Pevensie children are excruciating painful to watch. Their acting's very contrived and forced, and I wonder if there could be other worthy contenders amongst those who auditioned. The pixel-creations of the animators gave the animals more range than the 4 kids. Tilda Swindon looked evil throughout, but that's about it. Somehow her androgynous role as Gabriel in Constantine was way better than her role here as the resident witch.The highlight is probably the much talked about, effects laden war scene, but from scenes in the trailer, there isn't much else to add. Already spoilt by mega war scenes from the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Chronicles doesn't go one up against what audiences already experienced, safe to substitute Uruk-hais and various Orcs with animals and mythical creatures like the centaurs. Lacking intensity throughout the battle, I was taking stock of which animal was on whose side, like the polar bears and white tigers on the side of the White Witch, and the mass of centaurs on Aslan's.Don't get me started on the religiousness and the classification that this film is ""Passion of the Christ"" for kids. If you subscribe to that, you'll believe anything. I think one must have read too much into the major sacrificial and resurrection scene. There is hardly any blood spilt, nor is there any major bloody torture scene to rival Mel Gibson's picture. Just because this scene is similar to Christ's resurrection, or the theme of the coming of the messiah(s), or the betrayal scene makes one label this movie as such, is stretching it a bit too far. It's a children's movie/story, for crying out loud, so just leave it as such.Will this movie make money? Sure, on the fact that it's an event movie. Chronicles of Narnia built its hype, but didn't offer anything new in terms of special effects, and was weighted down by mediocre acting and a plain, bland narrative. Should there be another movie based on the books, let's hope it betters the first one.","

"Mr_PCM","2 January 2006","The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an enchanting tale of magical creatures and places, a battle of good and evil, and of four children coming to terms with both being in a strange new land and their great importance to it. Originally a children's book, there is much for both younger and older viewers to enjoy.Like many English fans, I grew up with the old BBC television series, which was corny, hammy and wooden in the extreme, yet ultimately endearing and magical. Sunday nights were never the same after it finished. So it was with a slight sense of trepidation that I went to see this sacrilegious new version of one of my favourite books as a child. As it turns out, I needn't have worried, for director Andrew Adamson has blown the Beeb's version out of the water – as was expected by most. While most obviously the film benefits from a mega-budget the BBC could only dream of, the acting of the young leads is also superior. Here, Lucy (Georgia Henley) is even more wide-eyed and innocent, Edmund (Skandar Keynes) even more of a snotty little so-and-so, and Susan (Anna Popplewell) more mother hen-ish and reasoned. But there seems to be also a rather unlikeable quality to Popplewell's Susan; she seems much whinier than many fans will remember from the books – and it is supposed to be Edmund who is the unlikeable one. The best acting of the four however comes from the eldest; William Moseley's Peter here is less assuming or decisive. While he still takes great care of his siblings, the oldest Pevensie is portrayed by Moseley as being a more reluctant hero, taking more seriously his duty to his brother and sisters than that of saviour and King of Narnia – adding previously unseen depth to the character. Liam Neeson is perfectly cast as the voice of Aslan; his regal, dulcet tones perfectly fitting for the magnificent lion. But the show stealer is Tilda Swinton as the White Witch. Many have complained about her hair being blonde rather than black, but that is all that there can possibly be to complain about her performance. Her icy stare and cold demeanour, coupled with a restrained performance (in a role such as this it would be very easy to attempt to echo Barbara Kellerman's over-the-top performance in the TV series) perfectly capture the seductive and later chilling essence of Jadis. Ray Winstone, Dawn French and Rupert Everett provide a (greatly required) slightly lighter side to the film as the voices of Mr and Mrs Beaver, and Fox (a new character). Winstone especially is terrifically funny as the geezer beaver with the cockney accent.The narrative itself is simple and easy to follow, as befits a film which is primarily a children's story. But still, Adamson handles the action extremely competently, especially considering this is his first live-action film (he is primarily known for directing the Shrek films). Obviously there is a heavy allegorical slant to that of the life of Jesus Christ which some may find distasteful, but if you can get past that then there is a terrific story to enjoy, and visuals for your jaw to truly drop at. One of the most important sequences in the book is when Lucy steps into the wardrobe and emerges into Narnia for the first time. The sheer wonder felt by the young girl at seeing this entire snow-covered world in the back of a piece of furniture in an English country house is shared with the audience. The creatures too are excellent, centaurs and fauns blending seamlessly their human and CGI body parts.There is a smattering of new material in the film that appeared in neither the book or the TV series that may have die-hard fans spitting feathers, but the added scenes, including a stand-off on a slowly-melting frozen river and a prologue in wartime London, serve to add necessary depth to the characters. The final battle scene is also considerably extended from the two pages it had in C. S. Lewis's book to a battle to nearly rival that of Pelennor Fields (the first of many Rings comparisons).The score is beautiful; Harry Gregson-Williams has created a musical setting to nearly rival anything produced by Mr Shore. However the lack of anything choral or a stand-out phrasing to serve as a signature for the film means that the soundtrack alone will probably be better suited to background music rather than your full attention. A piece with the drama and power of 'The Bridge of Khazad-Dumb, for example, would have topped off the soundtrack very nicely.But this is only a minor criticism; Andrew Adamson has created a magical interpretation of the ultimate fantasyland, an accurate translation from page to screen, an exciting and captivating story and enchanting characters. As the original story was rather short, he does not need to get bogged down in detail and can therefore proceed through the film at a brisk pace, picking up speed to reach full throttle in time for the final battle. Although the film is over 2 hours, the time will simply not be noticed.A useful side-note for cinema-goers – watch through the acting credits for an extra sequence with Lucy and the Professor (an under-used Jim Broadbent – not often you can say that about him!) which may provide teasing hints for the future of the franchise.Roll on Prince Caspian!","

"Sirus_the_Virus","23 November 2009","Shrek director Andrew Adamson makes his big screen version of a classic novel. Perhaps I am a little too late reviewing this movie. Because it came out four years ago. But here I am now, reviewing it because I never have before. In this decade, there has been quite a few fantasy films. We've had Lord of the rings, Harry Potter, The Golden compass, Spiderwick, Twilight. I could go on forever. But I left out one film series. Probably the oldest one of them all. The Chonicles of Narnia:The lion, the witch and the wardrobe(try saying that ten times fast), the first of C.S. Lewis' novels. There are only two films as of right now. I think that the original is best, as what I thought on the books. Only cause I read the first one. I'll admit that the Narnia films aren't as good as Lord of the rings, but i'll admit that they go more for the family audience, which I kind of appreciate. A lot of children's films recently have sucked. Besides Up and Where the wild things are. Both have made my favorites of the year list.The Narnia films have something special. They have a happy mood throughout a lot of them. The Lord of the rings, though better, has a darker creepy mood. Same goes for Mr. Potter, The Golden compass and others. The Narnia films have some disturbing things, just look at Tilda Swinton as the White witch. Ew.The films revolves around The Pevinseive children, Susan, Peter, Edmund, and Lucy. When they are sent off to live somewhere else during the war, Lucy, the youngest, discovers a passage way to another land,m called Narnia, through a wardrobe. Where she meets a faun named Mr. Tumnus(James Mcavoy). Edmund also discovers Narnia, but screws everyone over when he meets The White witch (played very well by Tilda Swinton)and says that he can bring his brother and sisters for some treats. What a deal.So, the four children enter Narnia, where they meet a few Beavers(one voiced by Ray Winstone). Soon, once they learn of their brother's betrayal, Susan, Peter, and Lucy and the beavers set off to find their brother and save him.Also, they must fight in a war for Narnia with the king, Aslan(voiced by Liam Neeson).As I said before, these films aren't as good as Lord of the rings or Harry Potter. But I like what they aim for. They don't want to scare children, though they may do it occasionally. I like the Narnia films, and I hope to see more of them in the future.","

"tnrcooper","26 December 2005","While I'm not too familiar with the book or the faithfulness of the film to it, I'm told by reliable sources (my sister) that it is faithful in important parts-such as the death of Aslan. I found the film very enjoyable and rewarding. While living in England as a little boy in 1981 or 1982, I saw the original BBC adaptation of the book and was blown away by it. Now I'm very curious as to what it was I saw that so amazed me as a little boy. Perhaps it will appear quite hinky or cheesy now-perhaps not. Be that as it may, this film I found very enjoyable. Adamson, the director of Shrek, uses special effects as they should be used-judiciously. While the effects were sometimes unconvincing-such as one shot in which the children are standing in the foreground with the sky behind them-possibly while the children were walking toward the White Witch's home. By and large though, I found the film to be an exuberant and lively endorsement of the adaptation of books. The book is such a classic but yet it seems to have been quite happily received. I found the director kept the essence of the story-between good and evil-in focus and this holds the focus of the story quite clearly. Adamson keeps the compelling story front and center and does not get waylaid by the temptation to animate or enliven a film with flashy but ultimately unnecessary special effects. Tilda Swinton as the White Witch deserves an Oscar nomination, in my opinion. She was so effective that one can imagine that she might get hate mail in which her character is confused with her real personality. She seems scary and that is the sign that an actor or actress has fully inhabited a character. One really dislikes her and roots for Aslan and the children. Ultimately though, I would give immense credit to director Adamson for restraint in the creation of this film. He could have easily submitted to the temptation to enliven the film with special effects but he realized that CS Lewis had already written a book that, if adapted quite honestly, would play powerfully by itself. This is a wonderful and inspiring film.","

"judiciary","29 December 2005","C.S.Lewis died the same day John F. Kennedy was shot, which partly explains why his passing went unnoticed. Known to the academic world as a literary critic and to the religious world as a defender of traditional Christianity, Lewis nonetheless deserves a high rank among literature's great story tellers. Countless children have thrilled to the story of Lucy and Peter and their siblings discovering the magical land of Narnia where it is ""always winter and never Christmas"" by passing through a musty wardrobe while visiting a remote English castle. Now that tale has been cast on the big screen, and what a production it is!The graphics work especially well with the live action stars because any evidence of animation adds to the dream quality of the story. The battle scenes are simply breath-taking and the pending attack by wolves frightening even for adults. This is not a movie for preschoolers but one which ought to be required viewing for every teenager with any interest in literature or the Christian faith.This movie works on so many levels that it is difficult to highlight its successes. The child actors are exceptional and the make-up for imaginary creatures leaves viewers as believers. The scenery from New Zealand, and Czech Republic, and Guatemala, and Los Angeles (oh, I forgot Poland!) suggest someone had a lot of fun tracking down film locations.References to the Blitz and Turkish Delight bring a charming English quality to the film, but it transcends all nationalities. The only reservation one might have is the blending of myth and history in the modern day miracle play (Saint Nicholas is real, as are unicorns and fauns and satyrs, which may raise doubts about the symbolic lion or the reality of the White Witch in real life) yet this is a story about human nature. Edmund is Everyman who blunders his way into betraying an innocent friend of his sister for the sake of sweets. We see innocent and credulous Lucy, the ""daughter of Eve"" in all of us, who hardly doubts for a minute the reality of what her child like faith has revealed to her.Don't miss this show for gorilla!","

"ScottDMenzel","9 January 2006","""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, Witch and The Wardrobe"" is about four children who are sent away to live with a professor because of a war going on in London. Once at the professor's house, Lucy (Georgia Henley) suggests that they play hide and seek. Lucy runs into a room which contains nothing but a wardrobe closet. Out of curiosity, Lucy opens the wardrobe closet and discovers that this closet leads to the world of Narnia.When ""Narnia"" first began I will admit I felt quite bored but it wasn't long before I got involved with the story and the beautiful set designs and locations. I also must admit, I have never read this book before yet I was very well aware that it was based on a very popular series of books. As a film, ""Narnia"" really impressed me especially for a Hollywood Blockbuster. What I liked most about the film was how beautiful it was! The director Andrew Adamson really captured the beauty of the set designs and filming locations.Normally I feel special effects lately are so over used. The last ""Star Wars"" and ""King Kong"" are both perfect examples of how special effects are used to much and actually make a film lag because of it. ""Narnia"" on the other hand used special effects but used them wisely. I also think that the special effects in this film looked more realistic then ""Kong"" and I think they added more to the story. The entire battle scene was captured brilliantly.The acting was very good in this film. Tilda Swinton plays the White Witch and played the bad character like the role was tailor made for her. The children in the film Lucy (Georgie Henley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Peter (William Moseley) and Susan (Anna Popplewell) all did fantastic jobs. Not to mention, Liam Neesen who voiced Aslan the lion. Liam really brought the lion to life. Good job all around.I can't comment much on the writing since it was based on a book and since I never read the book, I can't say whether or not the screenplay was loyal to it. However as a normal Hollywood ""Big Budget"" Blockbuster, I will say that I thought the script was very well done especially when building the story and character development. As I mentioned earlier the director behind ""Narnia"" is Andrew Adamson who was also the director of both ""Shrek"" films. He did a great job directing and capturing all the beauty and emotion of the film.So in conclusion, ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is a near perfect big budget Hollywood film. I for one really enjoyed the film and now can not wait for the sequels. I enjoyed this film as much as I enjoyed the last ""Harry Potter"" film and I think the reason is because it seems like a grown-up type of movie that some kids can enjoy too. The violence in ""Narnia"" probably keeps some parents away from taking their kids to it but I think that's a good thing. This movie is definitely one of the most beautiful films I have seen all year and on top of it is probably one of the best blockbusters I have seen as well. I recommend this movie to all who enjoy fantasy films or well made Hollywood blockbusters.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is a 9/10. Definitely one of the best big Hollywood blockbusters I have seen in the last couple of years.","

"cosmic_quest","8 December 2005","As a loyal Harry Potter fan, it pains me to say this film totally blows all four HP films off the map and it's even in league with the excellent 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. It definitely deserves to rake it in at the box office and rank as Christmas number one. Based on second of the classic Narnia chronicles (the first in the series as CS Lewis intended), 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is centred around the four Pevensie children-- fifteen-year-old Peter, thirteen-year-old Susan, eleven-year-old Edmound and eight-year-old Lucy-- who are sent to the vast country estate following the London Blitz. There, the children discover a wardrobe which contains the path to the magical world of Narnia, dominated by the cruel and vile White Witch and her minions. As prophesised, it lies to the children to join forces with the majestic Aslan to lead Narnia to freedom.It's been many years since I read the book (far more than I like to think although I'm going to remedy that by re-reading it as soon as possible) but I felt that Ann Peacock did a wonderful job of adapting the novel to screen and fitting it into a measly two hours and twenty minutes. There obviously were some cuts made but everything that was important remained intact and the story stands well on the big screen, particularly the Stone Table scene and the battle.The characters were portrayed perfectly with Edmound being impudent without being totally hideous while Susan's bossiness is not too overbearing. Fans of Peter and Lucy will enjoy how they come across as the lead heroes of the film, both being depicted as brave and loyal in their own way. It is refreshing to see the characters depicted almost exactly as they are in the books, rather than being dumbed down or made out to be 'cool' just to appeal to children in the audience. Those who fear a repeat of the rather mediocre Harry Potter young cast spoiling the film need not worry as the four child actors were excellent from start to finish. Adorable wee Georgie Henley stole the show as Lucy despite her tender age (and this being her debut film) and Skandar Keynes managed to portray a careful balance with Peter, showing his traitorous side but also his bravery and kinder nature. I wouldn't be surprised if all four went onto do many other projects.However, it was Aslan's scenes that dominate even if he is a CGI character! I know many people were worried about this, unable to see past Jar-Jar Binks, but it worked well and you'd honestly think they had a real lion do the shots. And Liam Neeson's vocal work was brilliant in thundering across Aslan's strength and nobility. Tilda Swinton was just positively vile as the White Witch, exactly as she should be! She was able to carry off how wicked and callow the White Witch was in a way that will leave the audience close to horrified.Overall, this film should certainly go down as a classic in the years to come. Everything was done so well, from the acting to the CGI to the musical score to the cinematography, and I'm sure both children and adults will thoroughly enjoy themselves. For something produced by Disney, 'Narnia' delivers as awe-inspiring performance without pandering to toddlers or mutilating the book. If anything, I think the PG rating it was given in the UK might have been a tad complacent as young and sensitive children may find some scenes hard to stomach (I know I would have bawled my eyes out at the Stone Table scene had I watched it at six years old; I nearly did even now and I'm in my twenties!). I recommend this to anyone looking to see a decent Christmas film.","

"holmqc","9 December 2005","I always applaud directors who stay true to the story and message which this movie does. The story, adventure, and graphics are outstanding and definitely want to see it again. The tale is a classic good vs. evil but for me it also makes the point that people are not all good or all evil. Everyone has good and evil inside them. The most important thing is to realize when you are committing evil acts and ask for forgiveness from the person that your wronged. And as the person wronged forgive others who wrong you. The Edmund and Mr. Thomnus characters speak volumes about being a character with a mixture of good and evil. My only negative comment on the movie is it could have used more character development. I realize the challenge in this with so many characters while keeping the movie to 2 1/2 hours. I am sure one of my personal heroes, CS Lewis, would be proud especially how it speaks of the Christian message without clobbering you over the head with it.","

"Lamol-Sthui","22 December 2005","I was a bit disappointed want I watched the trailer of this movie and was therefore a bit reluctant to visit it. Mainly because it showed scenes of these children with weapons and my thought was, what? Those children from the modern world with weapons knowing how to use them ready for battle? The beginning also put question marks to the movie because the city (which one by the way, London?) was bombed and the next day everyone can still take the train? They should have told that part a bit more clearly, but as soon as the Narnia part was beginning I was getting more and more impressed.Not only did they show a good landscape. The animated animals are also great fun to much. The acting of the children is good, I couldn't note any unnatural acting there. The witch was casted very well, she has a friendly face which lets you wonder if she is good or bad at the beginning.The lion made a great leader. The battles were displayed awesomely.In total I left the movie with a very satisfied feeling. I haven't read the book but I feel that the director did the very best in order to make this look like the book.I am giving it a 9 because a few scenes want to fast and should have been told a bit more clearly, for example, the scene at the beginning, or when The lion turned out to be alive he arrives with another great army (beside from the one already on the battlefield). My girlfriend told me that was because he released the spell of all those frozen by the witch but that wasn't perfectly clear to me.","

"spj-4","12 July 2006","I thoroughly enjoyed this thought-provoking & well-made movie. It successfully beckoned this adult viewer on a journey into the imagination & a world of fantasy. It has a great amount of relevance to the modern issues of child & adult alike. It was dramatic & absorbing in its unfolding story. Thereby appealing to young viewers, but too, held more complex messages for older viewers of any age. It works well on multiple levels, appealing to different kinds of viewers & their personal lives & concerns.It was also so true to life with the youngest of the children being the one whose concerns were initially overridden & derided. But too, it was this girl who actually was most open to the whole adventure that was about to engulf all their lives. How true of the nature of so many family & school situations, where such young minds are not appreciated or taken seriously or unjustly crushed, in our logical but deceptive world of experts, all bringing their common weight of superiority to dismiss any alternative thought, especially in a younger child.Yet this innocent girl is the one who finds this world & its curiousities joys & terrors more quickly & fully, while the older children are still struggling to look beyond their sense of self-importance. Isn't this so true of human nature in general? Especially in the modern adult world where any minority belief is mostly harshly scrutinised & criticised & dismissed. This movie offers a gentle message that the imagination & individual creative thought can be encouraged in us all. As surely as each of these children is duly given special gifts & talents that may help their individual personalities, & each other, even their broader community.The character of the God-like hero of a lion, covering for his kingdom & its constituents, is most thoughtful & impressive. A wise leader who literally serves his kingdom, as the best of leaders do! Also impressive were the use of special effects & magnificent scenery, with intriguing creatures & beautiful colourful costumes.All in all, those who take this journey to Narnia with an open mind & heart, will be rewarded for whatever gifts & sense of wonder that they bring to this very enjoyable & effective movie.","

Everything, honestly, about this film is wonderful: The acting, the music, the animation, the scenery, etc. See, I'm not displeased at all.I always loved the BCC form of The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe and the cartoon. but it was so truly cool to see it like this. If Mr. Lewis was still alive, I... believe he would really like this one.Now the actors and actresses were all very excellent. The children and teenagers who played the four Pevensies (Henley, Popplewell, Keynes, Moseley) are very good at acting, really. Swinton makes a perfect fit for the tall, calm and cruel Jadis, the White Witch. And Neeson does a wonderful job for the voice of the divine, strong but loving Aslan, the lion and the King of Narnia.I'm so pleased with everything about this film and, most of all, just happy Narnia's has gone to theaters after all this time and I hope they will make the fellow sequel books into films too. Here they are: Prince Caspian, The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, The Horse And His Boy, The Magician's Nephew and The Last Battle. Its absolutely an excellent film, please see it with your family... And if you don't know, there are secrets deeper into the story then you think, huh? Try to find them out.","

"thespian57","29 December 2005","Having grown up with the Oz series, the Rings series, and the Narnia series, Watching this movie at age 48 gave me a chance to be a child again. I was drawn into the film from the start. What really got my attention was the comparison of the bombed out London to the land of Narnia where it is always cold and never Christmas... not much joy there, but the children worked together and brought it back just as in the books. I won't comment on the technological aspects, only that this film is a worthwhile view for children of all ages yes, all ages. I wish I could see it with my ten year old daughter and be her age all over again. With all the garbage that is being sold as quality movie viewing, its nice to see a film you can enjoy with your children again. I mean children younger than 13. The potter series is good but I wouldn't take my younger daughter to see it because its a bit much for her to understand. But this series is perfect for your young ones.Well done Disney!","

"kayspam","9 December 2005","Most people already know the story so I won't recap. All I really want to say is that I have waited 25 years for this movie.. and I was not disappointed! If anything my dreams were exceeded. The casting was incredible, there is nothing about any of the characters that I would change. The scenery was fabulous. The special effects were great. I was worried about the use of so many CGI characters but at no point did I feel that they caused any distraction and their implementation was perfect (IMHO) I am a big enough fan of the series that I did go out and buy the BBC version (on VHS and then on DVD when it became available) simply to have SOME cinematic rendering of the text. It wasn't bad for a television series directed at children. But this movie does much more justice to the full grandeur of the book.I am looking forward to the rest of the books in the series.","

"playersww","12 December 2005","I entered the theater a little worried. I began reading CS Lewis when I was 12 and I had already read the first book to my 6 year old daughter so the cat was out of the bag on Christian morality in our world of myths of legends (as well as a good dose of pagan nature worship). But I was unsettled by some of the reports on the news about how the Christian right had been targeted by Disney for this film and that it managed to get a PG rating (putting it somewhere in between ""Because of Win Dixie"" and ""Racing Stripes""). So, I feared that my beloved books would be zealously Chistianized for the sake of the massive Evangelical movement in this country and its many many dollars. To my delight, I found the same wonderful level of Chistian sentiment in the film that are in the books. Nothing offensive (to me at least), no dogma, no lectures, no secret Jesus messages beyond the original ones that Lewis included. And as I breathed a sigh of relief that this wasn't another ""Vegi-Tales"" the film washed over me like a bath of fantasy come to life. The mythical creatures were delightful and the world of Narnia was worth saving. And I loved Lucy (but I never felt much for Peter or Susan, not in the film, not in the books).After having watched The Lord of the Rings many times and even the Harry Potter films way more than I needed to I was beginning to grow weary of the fantasy world that was once wonderful, now a dark and forbidding place filled with evil. Peter Jackson's love affair with Orcs, demons and the Dark Lord is forgivable (because Tolkien was obsessed with it too, although Tolkien also created a Middle Earth that was so beautiful and ancient and amazing that you wanted to go there, to live there, but who would really want to live in Jackson's Middle Earth, full of ghosts and loneliness and decay). But Narnia managed to have the villainy without creating a hopeless world of darkness. Again, it felt like the books. And I didn't miss the blood and the slime that Narnia could have had. For me it was a real success.Now, let's hope that they are quickly shooting the next few books so that they can catch these kids before they get too old.","

"tiw","31 December 2005","Having read the book as a child I thought the whole film was a brilliant interpretation of what I read, although I imagined it set in a Victorian house, not that, that matters. The special effects with the animals are very believable as the talking and voice-overs are superb. The plot from beginning to end has been exceptionally well executed. Only with today's special effects could this film hit the nail on the spot so well, it is so real. The children play their parts spot on and Tilda Swinton/The White Witch with her black eyes and beautiful but chilling figure cuts a fetching but scary witch. I will take my children to see it, in the cinema and buy the DVD when it is out, this will be a classic movie and if the future anticipated films have the same superb ingredients the series will likewise be classics.","

"dfle3","20 June 2008","I intended to watch this when it was on the big screen but somehow never got around to it. Watched it on commercial TV the other night. Despite that huge handicap (incessant ads, banner ads etc.), I was totally enchanted by this movie, hence the 10/10 rating. Based on a series of books which I haven't read, I must say that as a movie, it worked wonderfully. In fact, it's even better than any of the Harry Potter movies I've seen (another book to cinema series of tales).Set during World War II in England, at the time of the German air-raids, it's the tale of the Pevensie family. The children are sent to the countryside to avoid the worst of the blitz. The children comprise the elder role-models Peter and Susan, along with their younger brother and sister Edmund and Lucy. I must say that Georgie Henley as Lucy Pevensie is absolutely adorable. Don't let that description put you off...these are English characters, not those highly annoying 'cute' kids American popular culture likes to foist on us.In this movie's favour is the humour...I was often amused by exchanges between the characters-like when Lucy first meets Mr. Tumnus.Anyway, from the grim opening of this movie, it eventually explores the fantastic alternative universe that is Narnia...a land of mythical creatures, both good and evil. On that level, this movie is a great adventure with great spectacle and terrific CGI effects (computer generated special effects-of places and creatures).Not exactly sure what age group this movie is pitched at, but I think it is a PG movie...perhaps a bit to dark for very young children-it does get into 'heavy' topics at times, which very young children might get upset by.Another big plus for this movie is the complex depictions of the characters. The eldest children are sensible. Lucy is good and Edmund has a more interesting trajectory to follow. Tilda Swinton as the White Witch is brilliant-one of those 'complex' characters I mentioned earlier. She also happens to be more menacing than Darth Maul!One very small gripe-a little annoyed at one of the mythical characters that made an appearance in this moviesomething for Virginia, perhaps?Anyway, this was such a promising opening movie that I will definitely see the first sequel next week, at the cinema. Sometimes you watch a movie that you know will or may become a franchise. More often than not, you make up your mind to not watch anymore in the series. The sequel will have to be really bad to kill this franchise.P.S. I've seen the sequel to this movie and will post up my review now.","

"Med-Jasta","27 March 2020","This is a such a great movie, especially for kids. It's fun and exciting and draws you into the fantasy. But you don't feel like they're holding back for kids. This really ignited the innocent kid inside of me. Good to see technology catching up to the imaginations of writers so we can see these visions on screen.And that aside they did such a good job adapting the book it's kinda insane. The mood is perfect and they way they portray Aslan... Even his voice sounds like Lewis is describing Nesson. They didn't change much. Really in the book you don't see the final battle and in this you do because it's a movie and it works better.I remember when this came out atheist didn't want their kids to see this because of the Christian aspects. I'm technically an atheist, but I don't like to call myself one because I don't like associating myself those people or with any group for that matter. But this isn't going to make your kid Christian. The Adam and Eve reference is brief and in a movie so full of stuff that kids don't know what they're talking about this reference will be included in there. And if you are so atheist that you can't understand the good messages that come out of religion or you don't even want your kid to wonder if there is a God then I don't think this family movie is your biggest problem. I like that they didn't remove this aspect because that's what CS Lewis believed in and we should respect other points of view and artist integrity.All in all great fun for the kids and the kids in us.","

"jdre","11 December 2005","The latest installment of children's lit - turned movie is the weakest. The green-screen use is laughable: for example, when standing on a hilltop, next to an animal whose fur is blowing in the wind, we see a too-close shot of the children, whose improperly-lit hair is standing PERFECTLY still... on a hilltop. The CG backgrounds are not detailed and very plain (hill, trees, no movement).Also, these children could not act, I hate to say it. Emotions, no. Excitement, no. Holding a sword like a human being, no.The pacing was somehow both too slow AND too fast. There were plenty of dead-air moments that failed to create suspense (people in my theater were snoring, getting up a lot, getting restless), and slow-mo of poorly CG'd battle, but the storyline development (or total lack thereof) was skipped over, pushed ahead, and seemed to take a back seat to the action (as is the formula for modern CD-heavy kids movies).The gore in the animal cruelty of sacrificing the Lion in a strangely pagan-esquire midnight ritual (I somehow didn't picture it like that as a kid reading the book) was beyond a PG depiction, (despite the cut away for the stab, and lack of blood anywhere) and gratuitous, smacking of The Passion of the Christ... but I guess that's exactly what they were going for.I guess as long as a movie doesn't show blood, body parts, or swear words, it doesn't go over PG, despite graphic depictions of pagan sacrifice, animal abuse, creepy cyclops and other humanoids, large-scale warfare, stabbings, beatings, and such.I'm no prude, it is a children's book -- but reading topics is less intense than seeing them graphically depicted on a big-screen, enough for maybe a 13?The storyline is so very simple - find wonderland, set off human alarm, Savior sacrifices himself for you and resurrects, win war against evil Christmas-hating witch. 4 steps. 3 hours to tell? It just isn't as complex as LOTR or even the better Harry Potters. That's why the pacing felt so slow.Had the characters been rounded out (one can interpret a book when making it into a movie, but nobody told Disney this) - it might have been better. If Judas, I mean Edmund, had been explored -- why was he so impudent? Did he really have fantasies of being King? Did he learn a lesson, or just go on/off from traitor to Witch-fighter? Any of these could've been explored instead of the dead-air treatment I watched.","

I have been waiting ever since. And I can say it was well worth the wait.The only major complaint I have is that they made too many small changes that I didn't see the point for.Tilda Swinton, despite being miscast, gives an excellent performance as the White Witch and deserves an Oscar nomination. In fact, I would nominate this film for Best Picture.Good job to everyone involved!","

"clay_thompson","9 December 2005","At times I view myself as a writer, mostly as avocation, but a writer nevertheless. When a beloved book is converted into cinema, especially a beloved book, I view it with apprehension.I imagined what Tim Burton would have done with this book and I simply shuddered. I can hear him now, ""No, I must make this 'my' Narnia."" While I recognize Burton as an imaginary and talented film maker, he is someone who does not normally respect the work of others. Fortunately for us all that he did not make ""Narnia."" When a film maker looks at this book, he is faced with the same challenges that Peter Jackson faced with the Lord of the Rings. First of all it was a book that belonged to J.R.R. Tolkien, and more recently the Tolkien family. Secondly it is a series of books that belongs to the generations of fans that sustained the remarkable publishing history. So it is with ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe."" Andrew Adamson is a fine cinematic story teller as proved with both Shrek films. Here he took a book with tens of millions of owners, and made a film that carefully walks the line common to all of the owners. It was a joy to watch his rendering of the story, and caring not to water down the more 'dynamic' portions of the book.I am amazed that Disney, better know for witches and ghosts, would allow a movie such as this to be made under their banner. The movie turns out to create a much better legacy than Michael Eisner deserves.Three cheers for Mr. Adamson","

"chiragkapadia2004","8 January 2006","The big screen adaptation of the 1st novel under the chronicles of narnia series by C.S.Lewis is a winner.All aspects of film making, from the cinematography to the art-direction to the editing to the rousing score all come together to deliver visually stunning and immensely satisfying movie experience. The world of Narnia and it's inhabitants are brought to life under the expert Andrew Adamson who has previously worked on the Shrek franchise.Fawns, ogres, beavers, magical horses, eagles who turn into flames, mermaids...the whole breadth of fantasy creatures are captured in the movie.And of course, Aslan, the lion messiah who guides the 4 children towards their destiny.Maginificient, grandiose, imposing and with a terrific screen presence. A special word here for Tilda Swanson who plays the role of the Snow Witch.I cannot imagine anyone else in that role,after having watched her. She is like, born for this role.She oozes evil in every movement, every gesture.The final battle scene, where she appears wielding swords and with a lion's mane around her, boy!A must watch.","

I've also acquired the BBC movies for my very young son, and when I watched them for the first time found it VERY hard to restrain my incredulity at the so very fake animals and 'special' effects. So when I saw the shorts for this movie I was rather excited, and my expectations have been fully satisfied. I went with a friend this very afternoon and loved almost every minute. There were a couple of scenes where the backgrounds don't look quite right but other than that it is just about perfect. It also follows the book so closely it's amazing. Highly recommended to all fans of the novel, you definitely won't be disappointed!","

"ChrisQ","29 December 2005","This was meant to be a ""stocking-filler"" - just a movie on a cold Christmas holiday afternoon. A children's story from over 50 years ago - probably with so many anachronisms and cuteness it might even be kitsch.Having already suffered the appalling massacre of JK Rowling's 4th book, I knew I could manage anything. However, when ""Disney"" came up in the opening credits I settled down for a good snooze. Definitely this was not a film this ""Grumpy Old Man"" could possibly enjoy!! Well how wrong I was!!! The cast was excellent. All credit to the 4 children, great young actors. The animation was stunning and the scenery, wow!! I was enthralled right from the start.There were a few tongue-in-cheek pieces of ""modern"" dialogue - but I found them to enhance the believability rather than the opposite. I would have to be a real old *** to find fault at all.Reading a couple of the (very few) negative reviews for this film  I wonder just what those critics expected from Narnia. This was a superbly-made children's fantasy!!","

It did feel surprisingly rushed though and I hope this is at least a trilogy from the way they ended it which was also a bit confusing for the audience. There were some questions that hopefully will be better explained in the books. The main being the ending seen of all the kids grown up then going through the wardrobe again as children. Action packed and heart warming. Teaches us the importance of family, friendship, and not being in such a rush to grow up and stop believing in the unbelievable. Over all a high 10 out of 10.","

"kaw1990","15 October 2006","I originally was not going to comment on ""Chronicles of Narnia,"" but as I was reading through the reviews one caught my eye that stated the children cast in the movie could not act. That made me click on the ""review"" button. It's quite the opposite - the four children (although I suppose neither Peter nor Susan are a child) fulfill their roles stupendously, especially Lucy and Peter.The film is wonderfully shot. The climatic scene is beautiful and throws you right into the middle of the story line. Perhaps what makes the movie so wonderful is that all ages can enjoy it. The expressions, tones, and actions of the characters make the sometimes difficult English vocabulary self-explanatory and simple to follow while providing enough sophistication to satisfy more mature crowds.Another enchanting aspect of ""Chronicles of Narnia"" is the special effects, which play out like eye candy. All of the amazing creatures looks so realistic that it's hard to believe they could be anything but alive. It's even more fascinating when you think they all came out of the mind of C.S. Lewis. Aslan's animation, for example, is brilliant.Without giving away any of the story line, I will say that it is unlike any other fantasy movie you've ever seen - but don't trust me on it. Go watch it yourself.","

"Groovey","9 December 2005","Children's fantasy is a most difficult genre to adapt for the screen, because the agendas of book and screen are so different. Fantasy allows such swift and non-rational changes that capturing it on a movie screen is much more difficult than painting the pictures in your head with words.Even with all the nice trailers, hype and good reviews, I went to see this with no small amount of trepidation. I first read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe about 40 years ago, and I've probably read it more than a dozen times since then. I was afraid that no amount of skillful CGI could make a convincing Aslan. More than that, I was afraid of a Disney-fied movie that washed out the messages in the movie, or included propaganda for various causes.I was wrong. This film succeeds in bringing Narnia to life beyond my wildest expectations. Aslan is believable, as is the witch.Most wonderful of all, however, is what they have done with the plot: almost nothing. There are quite a few changes in things for flow, but not a single one significantly affects the the story. No wonder, with a member of the Lewis family watching over every word and every scene. (I'm sure there will be ""purists"" who will scream because the beavers look like real beavers instead of furry people who wear clothes, who object to other little things as well, but who nevertheless missed the movie.) I can't judge how someone who has never read the Narnia books would read it, because they are written too deeply into my soul to set aside. I think those who had not read the books would nevertheless love the movie, but I cannot be sure. If you have read the books and wondered if the movie is up to the books, wonder no more.It is possibly the best book adaptation I have ever seen. The Lord of the Rings was an excellent adaptation, but it took a lot of liberties with the characters and plot. I think, on the whole, the adaptations were good, but there were several places in that most excellent trilogy where the characterization changes bothered me. Not so here.These are indeed the beloved characters and story from the book.Don't miss this film. Go see it in the theatres, if you can.","

"tsbraves","12 December 2005","The adaptation of ""Jack"" Lewis' story was extraordinary for a major motion picture. Although a few liberties were taken (like the Fox playing such a big part and no mention of the ""Emperor by the Sea"") all in all it was remarkable. The best thing about the movie, in my opinion, was the fact that it is so good and yet very family friendly. For example: I have a fellow co-worker who took his 5 year old. His son can never sit through a 90 minute movie let alone one as long as LWW. But with 1/2 hour to go he said to his Dad, ""I got to go potty, but I'll wait."" He was that captured by the film. LWW is of that quality... Lord of the Rings excitement but for every member of the family. Don't miss this flick!Here's my synopsis:The acting was very good to excellent. The film visually was stunning. The special effects were very good to excellent. (one or two cgi missteps were noticeable) The Directing was excellent. The adaptation was excellent.","

"Lady-of-Rohan","9 December 2005","One of the most anticipated films of the year is the adaption of the beloved book by C.S. Lewis ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"". With a cinema filled of families and people of all ages (there were more adults than kids), I was very excited about enjoying a film that I had waited impatiently for weeks to see. Just to get the negatives out of the way, Narnia is a bit slow. The first 40 minutes crawl by at a snails pace and the lead up to the meeting of Mr. Tumnus and Lucy is dragged out too much. But when all four kids get through the wardrobe, the story really gets to picked up by likable characters (the beavers come to mind) and tense scenes with the White Witch.As for the positive notes, the scenery was top notch, with many people in the audience audibly playing ""Where in the country was this scene filmed?"" The animation and special effects are brilliant as well. Most notably, Aslan, the lion saviour, is wonderfully animated and incredibly realistic. At times, you could just as well be looking at a real lion. Other effects of centaurs, fauns, griffins, beavers, and bull-headed monsters are also top notch.On an entirely different note, I really don't understand what all the fuss is about with the religious allegory. The symbolism is there for all to see including all the elements of sacrifice, and forgiveness, but it's not ""in your face"" or distracts you from the rest of the story. If you enter the cinema seeking an allegory on Somebody's sacrifice, you'll be content with what you see. And if you plan seeing this film just as a family friendly holiday movie, you'll be content too.In all, Narnia deserves a worthy 7/10. It may be a bit slow out of the gate and outstay it's welcome length, but it's a worthy family film that enchants both young and old and transports you effectively into the land of Narnia.","

"tommyg","10 December 2005","I totally enjoyed this film, particularly since I knew very little about it. The splashy ad in the newspaper gave me the impression that it was more of a cartoon than its highly developed graphics animation with tight script and direction.The best of what could be said has already been accurately written by others. What I walked away with was desire to know more about C. S. Lewis along his other books and writings.There was a wonderful mixing of Western religious dogma, spiritualism, witchcraft and perhaps a tinge of voodoo or whatever. Perhaps there was a hint of at least one portal somewhere that connects other universes or realms that co-exist with our own -- the one that Adam and Eve acquired. Quite contemporary concepts, for sure.Lewis' creative writing definitely fits well in uniting into one platform the debate between Darwin and Intelligent Design theories. Combine those two, and we get ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" (2005). I mean there were enough variant animals and critters in this film to temper the flotation Noah's Ark.And we don't have to even ponder about these four children of Adam and Eve and how they would select their life-partners -- presuming they cannot mate with those on the other side due to genetic differences. After all, they have only six Hobson's choices between Peter (P), Edmund (E), Lucy (L) and Susan (S): L+E, L+P,P+E and S+L, P+E. Any of those are within the Combo Darwin and Intelligent Design offerings.Just a thought about a great cinematic experience.","

"birdie-29","28 May 2006","Let me admit that I was wary about this movie at first. The trailers (to me)looked really really dumb, and I was afraid that this movie would be a huge flop and nobody would ever read the books again. I love the books. I loved them when I was a child, and after reading them again, I loved them even more. I wouldn't be able to bear seeing Lewis's books turned into a bunch of cheesy films that only featured too-high-tech computer graphics and dumb child actors that screamed a lot. Lucky for me, this movie was just the opposite of a disaster. Andrew Adamson does a GREAT job with the graphics, I must say, as that's what he does do best. But he doesn't make it ALL special effects, he adds warmth and love to this movie, he adds depth and feeling. By the end of the movie, you're nearly crying because you don't want the film to end. The child actors that play the four pevensie children are fantastic, Adamson couldn't have picked a better group of kids. Leading them is Georgie Henley, who plays Lucy. She's absolutely great, she lights up the screen, she has amazing talent as an actress, and she's so young! That's the best part, really. Skandar Keynes plays Edmund, and he's so evil and bratty at first, it's rather scary. Later on, however, he changes very much, and you can't help but like him. Anna Popplewell and William Moseley are great as the two older siblings; Popplewell is bookish and annoying enough, and yet Queenly and beautiful, so that she pulls out a perfect Susan, and Moseley is awesome as Peter. He makes you think, ""Heck, I want this guy to be MY older brother,"" and that's perfect, it's just what is needed.There's so much more that's majestic and wonderful about this movie, that I could go on for hours, but I'll only end by saying this; you miss out on something beautiful and heart-warming if you neglect seeing this film.","

"onepotato2","20 July 2008","I was really surprised at how seriously awful this movie is. The early scenes are fine enough, and Lucy's entry into Narnia is nice. But ultimately ""Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe"" seems to exist to transport audiences back to a time 30 years ago, when grotesque, over-produced, over-extended children's fare was the norm, because understanding children was a very low priority. Where to begin...? If your story culminates in a protracted, climactic war, you've made a war movie; this isn't exactly a genre kids are screaming for. That, and it takes the form of a long, lifeless sermon... another format that doesn't make children stampede to theaters. Every single moment of the movie is unengaging. The script sucks and lazy, hierarchical thinking insures that every moment has been scrutinized for maximum staleness; everything is done the way someone did it before. The film-makers find a sluggish way to mount every scene, and continually find ways to bring the movie to a complete standstill with characters spouting yet another boring pronouncement. It moves at the pace of a funeral dirge, and after maybe half an hour it has all the excitement of a diagram. Specificity vanishes to make room for more setpieces. Both Liam Neeson and Tilda Swinton give performances that some committee of drones approved. If your kid likes this, you've got yourselves a dud. Only pasty, anemic indoors-oriented Brit brats pining for a lordship could tolerate even twenty minutes of this. Sadly it's over two hours long. This movie is D.O.A..","

"cmc2392","25 May 2018","Best movie of all time.; great things about more sibling rivalry more than HP. The siblings Pevensie are more support and protect each other from evil witch ( lion Aslan's archenemy). Narnia is mystery magical delight land where youngest Pevensies, Lucy went to close that she discover. Lucy's brother, Edmund followed her after and approach the White Witch who control and turn him into a traitor against his siblings and later was in danger capture by White Witch who threat Aslan's army and territory including Pevensies . Edmund is main characters who has more serious neglect form his older brother Peter, great leader who care about Lucy and sister, Susan; bullying Lucy a lot. All of siblings rescue Edmund from White witch but Edmund apologizes and learn mistakes what he is done. Aslan lovingly show and present him as Just King not great but widely wisdom. After battle end, Pevensie fight White Witch's army. Pevensies present them heir to throne; Peter the great, Susan the gentle, Lucy the Valiant. 
 Therefore, the movie resemble (the show The Magician), Avengers, Harry Potter, A Wrinkle in Time and Bridge to Terabithia. It seems more like sibling rivalry. Great actings though; Gallagher from Shameless and Pearson from this is Us, both show showing family stick together.","

"phillipstephenso","6 December 2005","A little game of hide and seek can be surprising. Four English children are sent to a countryside mansion during World War II to escape the bombings. While there, they discover, through playing a game of hide and seek, a way to visit Narnia through a wardrobe. Narnia proves to be a parallel world undergoing a crisis similar to that which faces their own world. The plot then takes several fairy tale like turns including the delightful faun, a whole menagerie of charming animals who talk like humans, a scary witch queen, centaurs, and finally a medieval battle similar to those found in the Lord of the Rings. But, C.S. Lewis clearly intends to use this story to share his heartfelt theology of grace, to which he devoted much of his life. Of course, Aslan the Lion is used to represent Christ the King in this parallel world. And Aslan, like Christ, is the real meaning of sacrifice and resurrection in Narnia. So, C.S. Lewis shares again, in effect, the miracles of meekness, prophecy, grace, suffering, and glory of the Gospel in this fresh story of triumph. Mere Christianity is not so mere, after all. Meanwhile, the animation of this film is nothing short of breathtaking while the script and actors are all first rate, even the talking beavers.","

"kidhasaces","9 January 2006","I have been looking at the ratings for this movie for the past few weeks and as much as I wanted to see this movie I didn't get a chance until today. The ratings were decent so I was expecting a decent movie but I didn't get a decent movie, I actually think that this was one of the best movies I have seen in years.I think the rating doesn't pay its respects to this awesome movie. I haven't read any of the books therefore I can't compare both although for someone who has never read these books I must say I was shocked on how beautiful this entire adventure was. I seriously can't remember the last time where I have been at the movies and haven't at least once looked at the time during the movie or left the theater with an ""awww"" feeling about it. I actually felt like I wanted to take part of this amazing adventure.I got to the movies about twice a week and after watching King Kong I fought it would be impossible to beat but Narnia did that simply for the story and the point of the movie.The effects were well done, the characters were true and so realistic which is what made this movie incredible.I would vote in 10 on 10 because not once did I ever have a negative comment which is rare in my case :) What I like about this movie it completely removed any worries in my mind, made me think of my youth and how imagination can be at times.I think that this movie is great for all groups of ages because no matter what we all have youth in us and I truly believe you will at least enjoy this!

"Cel_Stacker","23 December 2005","A year of overdone franchises, pretentious biopics, and realistic downers at the movies ends with this well-timed, refreshing piece, which is even more amazing considering it is indeed the most fantastic allegory of the Greatest Story Ever Told.In short, the four Pevensie children escape the war-torn suburbs of early 40s London, joining their relative, an eccentric professor (Jim Broadbent) and his governess-like assistant at his countryside manor. The kids have trouble appreciating one another, despite the harsh circumstances they have just faced. Gradually, they discover that the spare room wardrobe is actually a portal to a world beyond their imagination, the world of Narnia. They find themselves on the run from the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), caught up in the centennial struggle between the Witch and the icon of justice, Aslan (Liam Neeson), and most importantly, becoming a family again.Despite its most serious origins, this story is just plain fun. I may be biased--I've read the wonderful source material from C.S. Lewis thrice. If accuracy in comparison to the novel would bother you, stay away. This is truly a big screen interpretation, but done most respectfully by Andrew Adamson, the director best known for the Shrek films. (Yeah! I know!) He shows quite a departure here, showing love and reference for the original story in this interpretation. Although a few stars are involved, one of the big reasons to see it is for the previously unknown talent, including breakout performances by James McAvoy (Mr. Tumnus), Patrick Kake (Oreius the Centaur General), and, of course, William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie Henley as Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy respectively. Breathtaking visuals, that quite frankly, outdo the best of Potter round out the mix. The final battle is not to be missed. Finally, nothing from the original work that was left out of the film will be terribly missed. (I was delighted, in fact, that the Christmas Party was not attempted. Arguably, the saddest part of the story.) The audience aimed at is certainly children, but don't be surprised to find yourself enchanted as well. Even though you may not like to, please, PLEASE stay for the credits to see the epilogue, straight from the book, as well as some nice compositions. A very good time.","

"codeE","12 December 2005","I read the book a few times over the years, I saw the cartoon when I was a kid(I don't know why they don't show that anymore!?) then there was the live action version they showed on PBS. All of which were very good and worthy of DVD releases(I'm waiting). Now we have a feature length, big budget, special effects laden version to re-tell this great story. So naturally I was scared that it would get ""the treatment"" and suck, or be just OK. Well to my relief it was everything that I hoped for. The actors were great, the CGI effects were top notch and above all the story came through. My kids and I loved the movie. I was worried for my youngest when it came to the sacrifice part but it was handled well and we made it through with a minimum of tears.","

"Metalfairy","8 December 2005","I expected a lovely, lavish children's movie along the same lines as Harry Potter with huge chunks likely to be omitted. Once I started watching I just no longer cared. The acting was absolutely fantastic and Tilda Swinton was an absolute joy to watch. I cried, I laughed, I admired the courage of Peter. The little girl who played Lucy was a pleasure to watch.For those unaware of CS Lewis's masterpieces, this is the second book of seven ""Chronicles of Narnia"", about the four Pevensie children who accidentally stumble across the Land of Narnia and a tense situation between Aslan (voiced wonderfully by Liam Neeson) and the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).The Christian Allegory so many press articles seem to be picking up on is there and very blatant. But so what? What I saw was a fantastic retelling of CS Lewis's book and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.The two and a half hours just flew by and I wished it could have been longer but no doubt the fidgeting children would have been a nuisance. Perfectly condensed, great casting and some lovely effects. I could not have asked for more.","

"MagicStarfire","24 June 2006","9 stars out 10 This film contains quite a lot of violence and dark scenes that are very threatening in nature. I would not recommend a very young child viewing this. I think it is too frightening and intense. A mature eight year old might could handle it, ten would be better.There were things I most definitely liked about this story/film, and a few things I didn't.They seemed to have a little problem with the way the wolves walked/moved, but over all, the special effects were brilliant.I enjoy films that feature mystical creatures and beasts such as the minotaur, centaurs, fauns, unicorns and the like, as well as all the animals talking.The story revolves around 4 English siblings during WWII, who accidentally discover the wonderful world of Narnia.Narnia is in deep trouble, however, and therein lies both the source of an interesting tale and some clichés that we really need to move past.I was pleased that a little girl (it's always a little boy) is the first to discover Narnia, even though the actress who played her was mud ugly, poor thing.And I was completely delighted with the faun who comes into the picture early, along with the magnificent lion and all the other creatures.However, I noted Mr. Beaver could have been a little nicer to his wife, there are some put-downs by him I could have done without.We also have the old tired cliché of the wolves being the vicious bad guys, and the only powerful adult female in the film is, as so frequently happens, depicted as mean and evil. The fact two girls (sisters) are in the film, as well as their brothers, does off-set this some, I will admit.Another gripe I have is the old cliché of the outsiders come to this troubled world and they are, of course, the only ones who can fix the problem. Then after they fix the problem, they are promptly fawned over as heroes by the entire population and raised to a very high social level.WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD: While I assume Edmund learned his lesson, it would have been nice to have actually heard him apologize to the lion and to his siblings.The lion sacrificing himself for worthless Edmund set very poorly with me, even though it turns out all right for the lion. I just didn't like that it happened at all.I also felt the lion should have been the king of Narnia not a bunch of outside kids, and if there needed to be more than one throne occupied then make them be the lion, the faun, and the two beavers. Maybe they should make that five thrones, and include the brave fox. Although the fox is killed I would assume he could be brought back since everybody else good that got killed or frozen could.","

"Pickwick12","9 December 2005","This film is so many things that it is difficult to put them all into words. The story of a little girl who goes to a magic land has delighted readers for fifty years now, but never before have filmmakers had the technology to convincingly create the things C.S. Lewis imagined with such clarity. The special effects and creatures are marvelous.The acting is also laudable. The children deliver obviously heartfelt performances, particularly commendable because the story requires them to display so many different emotions.The score contributes to the beauty of the film, adding a subtle layer of mood that never overpowers the action.The story is well told, fast-paced and moving. As huge fan of the book, I am not disappointed.Finally, I believe there is something transcendent about this movie. It moves beyond the realm of most children's films, even good ones, and explores themes of loss, courage, death, fear, weakness, and ultimate sacrifice. I leave every viewer to find out for himself or herself what it all means. What I believe you'll be sure of is that it definitely means something, and it just might take your breath away.","

From music, to acting, this movie is a must watch for LOTR fans! There were a few problems though: 1-it was a kind of fast movie 2-adding some more sequence and time to it, would not hurt 3-the acting could have been more better (but considering it was the children's first movie, that's okay) all in all this is a must see movie! Aslan's voice was done by Liam Neeson, and that's a good thing because everything matched so perfectly well together. And as the movie starts on, you sit at the edge of your seat, dying to know what happens.(that's because it's way different from the book, and I knew I sat at the edge of my chair!)","

The visuals are gorgeous, the music is beautiful--everything is simply amazing. This movie takes us to the world of Narnia. I will say that as a movie, this is excellent. Those unfamiliar with the book will enjoy it. I did read it, and I will tell all of you who have read it as well--you will not be disappointed. Sure, some dialogue is left out; some scenes are cut and/or extended; and some things are not explained--but this is the MOVIE version of Narnia. If we want it exactly as the book, we might as well just read it again. This film stays true to the important and outstanding parts from the book, and I was simply awed. Tilda Swinton plays an excellent and very cold White Witch--she was indeed convincing. Her portrayal of Jadis is very well-done. The scenery, the magical creatures--just stupendous. People are calling this a miniature Lord of the Rings. Well of course--C.S. Lewis and J.R.R Tolkien were friends, so it would make sense. I have already said all I could say about this wonderful film. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful =) 8.8/10 Stars","

"tomcat91468","7 January 2006","I liked it. I liked the Christian analogy. I liked the symbolism and the message of redemption. It was entertaining and the performances, direction and special effects were excellent. Enough said about that. The movie, Narnia, held my attention as a Grandma; however, I was a little concerned whether my 7 year old Granddaughter would be able to hang in through the long hours. I was also concerned that some of the scarier parts would be frightening to her. Well, she hung in and wasn't particularly scared except when the (I'm trying to avoid a spoiler) lion was put on the stone. It's not for a child younger than 7 and it's not for every 7 year old. I did think the conversation that came afterward was a beneficial one. Explaining why this movie was an analogy to Christianity was a good opening to a discussion about always trying to do one's best and how God's forgiveness is always there for us.","

"roberthanly","11 December 2005","This movie blew me away. It exceeded all my expectations in all areas. I have never read the book, so this comes from a person who saw the movie first. Tilda Swinton steals the show in my opinion, as the White Witch, while the CGI and animal-speech is astonishingly believable. The soundtrack is in a league of its own with its own unique feel and its own unique melodies. While the children's' acting doesn't convince very well at the beginning, it all picks up and we see some very talented youngsters, taking on a very passionate story extremely well. The entire film is just such a pleasure to watch - go and see it. It's worth every minute.","

"JediKMan","11 December 2005","All I can say is wow. This movie impressed me beyond my comprehension. Now don't get me wrong, I knew it would be good, but I sure didn't expect it to be exquisite. I went in the theater without knowing a thing about the movie. I had never seen a preview, never read the book, never heard anything about the story, and from the moment the adventure began, I felt just as engrossed as the main characters were. One thing that scared me is all the hype. A lot of times, hype scares me. I mean, everyone was talking about it, putting it up on a pedestal, so I expected mediocrity to be honest, but after seeing it, I felt more satisfied than I ever have about a movie.The musical score, although not as epic as Lord of The Rings or Star Wars, felt very appropriate. I had never heard of the composer before, and it was a bit of a shocker that Disney chose to use him (Stephen Barton) over a few of their usuals (Klaus Badelt or Brian Benison) I have never read a book by C.S. Lewis, but I definitely caught the references to Christianity in the movie. It was so apparent that even non-Christians that are familiar with the bible in the least bit would pick up on them. I have heard a lot of people claim that Lewis was a Christian, hence the reason there are so many, subtle, and non-subtle references. This film was the first since Lord of the Rings, which grabbed me and took me through the adventure, and immersed me in the world of Narnia. The computer generated graphics, in my opinion, are equal to that of Lord of the Rings, if not better. One main difference from, which I feel appropriate to cite, is the fact that this feels more like a fairy-tale than the Lord of the Ringstrilogy. That definitely isn't a bad thing though. Liam Neeson voiced one of the characters, which added so much to the movie. And for the first time in a long time, a movie almost caused me to cry. It's not necessarily because there are sad parts, but when you get so engrossed, and feel like you are there, it almost makes you emotional. Very, very impressive.","

"MaxBorg89","28 December 2005","Before Harry Potter made his appearance, there was another fantasy series people (not just children) all over the world loved, and still love: The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S.Lewis. Now the saga has been successfully transferred to the screen (an attempt had already been made on TV in 1988-1990, but the result, while faithful to the book, was rather annoying).Based on the first volume in the series (it's actually the second if you follow the suggested reading order, but the first Lewis wrote), The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe tells the story of the four Pevensie siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, who have to leave their home in London during WWII and live in Professor Kirke's (Jim Broadbent) huge mansion. It is there that they find the titular piece of furniture, which will lead them to Narnia, a magical world inhabited by all kinds of creatures: talking animals, fauns, centaurs, and of course the great lion, creator and king of Narnia, Aslan himself (voiced by Liam Neeson), who reveals to the children their arrival has been foretold and anticipated for years, as they're supposed to help him defeat the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), who has cursed the entire enchanted world with an everlasting winter. It's all gonna be a huge adventure, part Harry Potter (the kids who are introduced to another world and find out they are ""chosen ones""), part Lord of the Rings (the epic battle between good and evil).Okay, let's calm down with the ""epic battle"" bit. As visually mesmerizing as it may be, it suffers from the camera being a little prudish and looking away in the crucial moments. After all, we're talking about a PG feature, but come on: we're in the 21st century and this is actually the darkest opus in the saga (alongside The Silver Chair). They have even added a sequence which wasn't in the book to make the story more dramatic.That said, this wonderful movie doesn't seem to have any significant flaws, except the fact that some of the CGI wolves look a little bit too fake. The other beasts, however, look fine, and their voices are provided by a bunch of talented people: Ray Winstone's Mr.Beaver (and spouse) perfectly serves his purpose as the funny sidekick and Rupert Everett's turn as Fox makes it pretty clear why said animal is the symbol of unreliability, while Neeson's Aslan is the wise and kind mentor/father figure, in the same league as Richard Harris'Dumbledore and Ian McKellen's Gandalf. On the human side, Swinton is the standout as usual, proving you don't need excessive make-up to be a threatening presence. She is a very worthy villain for this film. The kids are good too, the quality of their acting increasing as the story goes on (lucky for us the movie was shot in chronological order).As for the Christian subtext everyone's been talking about, it is present but you don't have to interpret the film that way if you don't want to. Just consider it a hugely exciting fantasy outing and you'll be satisfied.So, after this remarkable experience, will the other six books be turned into movies as well? To paraphrase Professor Kirke, keep your eyes open...","

"talbaineric","10 December 2005","Sure, we have mega blockbusters like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, both of which were excellent movies in their own right. But the Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe shines in it's own right. A true masterpiece among the ages that deserves just as much praise as HP or LoTR, probably even more.I won't go into a synopsis of the movie, seeing as how most of you have either read the books or have seen the movie already and know it's plot. The accidental discovering of an enchanted land ruled forever by winter by the evil White Witch Jadis (Tilda Swinton in all her icy splendor) prompts the Pevensie family (with little Lucy first discovering the land) to eventually realizing their destiny and joining forces with the powerful Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), ensuing in one of the coolest battles in cinema history.This film was very magical indeed. Not only does it capture the essence of the book very well, it also adds it's own little touches of Disney magic here and there. Hard to believe you were watching a Disney-made movie, but that's what it is. Truly cinema magic. I also felt that it was more drama-free than Harry Potter franchise and much more joyous and cheerful then the Lord of the Rings franchise.Looks like Disney has struck gold once again with this one. Go with the family or take a friend (or a few friends) and go see this!","

What can you say about a children's (and adult) classic that has been faithfully brought to the screen? I could almost feel the pine needles pricking my skin as they backed into the woods from the rear of the wardrobe. The snow falling on Lucy's hair and eyelashes (god help me, shades of the Sound Of Music) but it really was effective.The acting (both human and animal) was right and not over done. I was lucky to see a special preview with lots of children and with some adults who remember their childhood. All seemed pleased.A note of caution. There is some violence, mild and no gore, but small children in attendance did find it hard to watch some of the battles and especially were upset with the death of Aslan. But, they recovered well when he re-appeared.Loved the book as a child and love the movie as an adult. If you do not have a child, borrow one and go to the movies.","

While at the estate of their caretaker, the youngest child discovers a wardrobe that leads into an alternate world in which a prophecy holds that she and the rest of her siblings are destined to come and save the people of Narnia from the rule of an evil white witch who calls herself the queen of Narnia (and is played to perfection by the icy Tilda Swinton). Many elements in the film are very similar to Christian belief, for instance the Lion can be thought to be representative of Jesus Christ if you look within the context.The soundtrack is especially exquisite, especially that one song by Alanis Morrissette and that 'I can't take it all in' song.Jim Broadbent and Liam Neeson co-star.","

A film of high quality, amazing acting, superb special effects, beautiful choreography, plus much much more! What's more NO sex, and NO swearing! The pace of the film did not drag for the most part and the screenplay was well written based on the beloved book by C.S. Lewis. *Spoilers throughout* The film opens with the blitz of London in 1940 with German Nazis bombing the city. This forces the children away from home and into the English countryside. The ""Evacuating London"" score is wonderful to listen to as the title comes down like snow as the children are leaving on a train. They're sent to the home of an older professor. One day during rain, the children play Hide and Seek to ""Oh, Johnny, Johnny"" sung by the Andrew Sisters. Lucy, the youngest, finds a wardrobe that goes into Narnia, a land that has been frozen for 100 years by the evil White Witch. Soon all four of the children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) embark on an adventure like nothing before. Edmund betrays them when he meets the Witch earlier, and the children must go to meet the TRUE KING Aslan. Aslan preforms the true meaning of sacrifice dying in the place of Edmund for his faults. Killed by the Witch and then rises again and ""death itself started working backwards."" The battle scene at the end is amazing before the children are crowned the kings and queens of Narnia. ""Once a King or Queen of Narnia, always a King or Queen of Narnia"" as Aslan remarks. The children grow up in Narnia going into their 30s I from what I can tell before leaving the wardrobe to return to being children once again. Just as they fall out the professor walks in and says, ""What were you children doing in the wardrobe?"" ""You wouldn't believe us if we told you,"" remarks Peter. With a twinkle in his eye the professor replies, ""Try me."" This film has something for everyone. I was surprised when I saw it opening day and people from all age groups were there. Children who were three all the way to Senior Citizens being 70 or 80. The plot is good and teaching great lessons. The Beavers offer great comic relief and the music sets the mood. Enjoy and be sure to stay through the first part of the credits for a final scene.","

"Kryzak","16 December 2005","Narnia can be summarized by two words: magical fun! As a kids movie, it was nearly perfect (if I were a decade or two younger ), but as a complete movie that stirs the soul, I can only give it an 8 (which is a very good score in my book!). Before I say anything, Tilda Swinton was simply BREATHTAKING (no pun intended) as the Witch in this movie! Her every move, every look, every gesture was pure art, grace, and *evil*! She literally stole the show and carried the movie, both at the same time.Otherwise, the story was fun if you watch it from a child's point of view. The special effects were done quite well (except for maybe a couple scenes here and there where you can tell it's a blue/green screen), and the child actors weren't too bad either. The little girl was definitely my favorite out of the 4 kids. Of course, there are many comparisons to Lord of the Rings, and I find myself thinking ""Gandalf!"" when I saw Santa Claus, or ""Galadriel"" when seeing the witch... Also, for fellow RPG geeks out there, my friend and I thought that Peter must have walked around in the same place to ""level up"" so that he went from not knowing how to use a sword to killing minotaurs...There were some concerns about heavy handed religious overtones in the movie, but that wasn't a problem at all. It was handled quite well and fit the story.All in all, great movie! Allow yourself to live your childhood again and you'll be immersed in the wonderful world of Narnia.","

"MSchlaf","9 December 2005","I LOVED this film. I'll admit, I'm a Narnia fan and have been for years and had my own preconceived notions of what and how Narnia should be, how all of the characters should look, act, and so on. So naturally, I went in with very lofty expectations and a ""show me"" attitude. I am more than happy to say that this film surpassed any and all expectations I had really does C.S. Lewis' work justice. Everything right down to the scenery was perfect and the acting was spot on. Only a few really *minor* issues with one or two of the outdoor scenes looking painfully obvious as being shot with a blue screen and matte paintings, but other than that, this film was excellent and I would gladly pay a good amount of money to see it again.Also, stay for the credits...","

"kathryn-behm","10 January 2006","Please do not confuse reviews from people who haven't read the book with ones from people who have.Those who have read the book are more emotionally attached. I cried several times through this movie - MUCH improved on the late 80's version. Powerful, emotional, TRUE to the book except for a few stray bits.I was thoroughly impressed. The visions I saw on the screen were very similar to those in my head as I was reading the book. The use of colors was wonderful, and the battle scenes were outstanding. I thought the CGI effects with the animals was very believable.Thank you for giving me a chance to see this movie.","

"zach-74","12 December 2005","Adapting a book that so many audience members have read and cherish is surely a daunting task, but I believe it is also a great responsibility. Recently, Peter Jackson set the bar pretty high in this regard with the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Unfortunately, Adamson's ""Narnia"" wasn't quite up to snuff.I count myself among those who cherish ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" having read them as a child and having re-read ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" in eager anticipation of the film. In my opinion, this film adaptation not only falls short, but does a disservice to the audience by cheating us of much of the impact and wonder of the original books.Here are the general categories (including some specific examples) where I felt the film didn't deliver:Screen Adaptation - Some important scenes that illustrated character dynamic were cut short making later behavior and motivation seem exaggerated or cliché. Example: The scene where Edmund meets Jadis was rushed and awkward. (It wasn't even demonstrated that the Turkish Delight was enchanted in order to manipulate Edmund - we were left to assume that his allegiance to Jadis was due solely to avarice!) Also, in the book, the mere mention of the name ""Aslan"" for the first time was an event that had an important impact on the children. In the movie this impact was all but lost, as these subtler points were sacrificed to save screen time for the type of gruesome battle scenes that you would expect from a ""fantasy"" movie but in this case didn't serve to advance the story. Another pulled punch: in the book, the scene with Father Christmas was a brilliant omen of the turning of the tides but here the scene seemed out of place and just downright weird. (They might as well have run into the Easter Bunny.)A couple of outright inventions served only to distract us from the magic and mystery of the real story: The waterfall scene - who came up with that idea? The cricket ball through the window - not as effective as the original story.Casting - The elder siblings were mediocre, and I can't tell if Tilda Swinton was just awfully directed or totally miscast. (In the book Jadis was a noble and grand enchantress, albeit with dastardly aims; in the movie she was shallow, petty and despicable.) Oh, and Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan the Lion was not nearly powerful enough--this is one of the most important roles in the film. Was James Earl Jones not available?Direction of Actors' Performances - This ties in with my comments about casting, above. Performances in individual scenes seemed disjointed from overall character motivations and some character interpretations (such as Jadis and Edmund) were shallow and unsympathetic. Where was the charisma that would have made Jadis's character believable, let alone have enabled her to amass an army of supporters? Hair/Make-up - Jadis sports blonde distractingly annoying dreadlocks despite her otherwise un-Irie nature. The professor's hair and beard looked about as realistic as a department store Santa, and the main Centaur's make-up also stood out as distractingly awful.Wardrobe - Jadis has one outfit in particular that looks like it came right off the runway of a bad 80's fashion show. Another includes an atrocious hat shaped like a giant icicle--Mr. Freeze from Batman & Robin would have had hearts in his eyes.Special Effects - Overall special effects were not nearly as cleanly integrated as WETA's work on LOTR, and cohesion was lacking. For example, the cuts between live action and CGI wolves were painful at best. Also, the teeming masses of bad-guys all looked as though they could have been extras in the Orc armies of LOTR. Mr. Tumnus was an example of the fact that Jadis's supporters were comprised of otherwise beneficent creatures that she'd charmed, threatened and bullied into joining her. Here they were unimaginatively portrayed as one-dimensional twisted, evil fiends.Cinematography - Boring; All the visual texture and lighting of a made-for-TV movie. Due to my disappointment in Adamson's interpretation of this work, and in the execution of the movie that resulted, I rate this film a 5 out of 10. It is not completely devoid of entertainment value but fails to uphold the responsibility that a filmmaker shoulders when adapting so well-known and well-loved a story.","

"phredd8675","26 December 2005","I went into this movie not really knowing what to expect. I have read just the one book in the series, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, so I am not too up on the rest of the stories. My wife really wanted to see this one (she has read all the books) and she wanted to take our son, who is almost five, to see it. He also knows the stories from videos. We tend to trade off on what movies we see: one time it will be my turn (sci-fi, horror, mystery) the next it will be hers (chick-flick, etc).I thought this was an excellent movie, very well made and well acted. The special effects are well above par and I look forward to seeing it again. I will not give anything away regarding what happens, because I hate reading things like that before I go to see a movie. I will say that there are some laugh out loud scenes and some tear jerker scenes.Do yourself a favor, see the movie. You won't regret it.","

"uehy-1","15 June 2008","Four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are evacuated from London during World War Ⅱ. So, they have to live in an old country house in countryside. One rainy day, Lucy found the big wardrobe in this house. Lucy steal in wardrobe, then surprisingly snow covered forest stretched away endlessly before her eyes. The snowy land is called Narnia and this land under a rule of white witch's law. Therefore Christmas never come. Four children decide to save the Narnia with lion, the true ruler of Narnia.It's based on novel written by C.S Lewis. I watched movie, then I read the book. This movie reproduced novel in detail, but little be different. Because it not perfect, you may be discouraged. If you love Lewis's novel, you have own image of Narnia... However, story and cinematography are wonderful!! It's not only time travel story and sci-fi. If we watch this movie, we can mature to another level. This is very popular with children. But it isn't childish movie. This movie be loved not only child but adult.","

"susannah-16","8 December 2005","I saw this with 6 eight year old boys, which may have influenced my opinions somewhat, but they were not gripped by this. Firstly though, there is a lot right with this movie. The special effects are stunning. How they got Susan and Lucy to walk through the forest with Aslan I will never know - the problem was I found myself trying to work that out, rather than gripped by the narrative. The kids are great. Georgie as Lucy is particularly good I think - very Lucyish and Skander manages to make Edmund less of a prig and more angry and at odds with the world. THere are epic scenes (the boys all said they liked the battle scene yet, and acted some of it out in the pizza restaurant afterwards), and swooping vistas and vast tracking shots and rousing music. Its just that I had never really thought of Narnia like that. In becoming epic, they have lost two things - the magic and the playfulness. Lets take the magic first. A tiny point, but the snow didn't sparkle. You know how snow glistens and glints ? Well not in this Narnia it didn't. It wasn't a magical place to wander into - it was all too big for a start - massive walls of rock and huge mountains. Not strange enough a landscape (and it looked VERY like some of the landscapes in Lord of the Rings) - not intimate enough. And the playfulness ? This Narnia isn't a fun place to be. We lose some of the fun of the Beavers and their house. THey cut some of the scenes which would have lightened up the narrative (like when Aslan comes to life, in the book he runs around and plays tag, and they all end up in a heap laughing and excited and HAVING FUN. In the film, he gives a roar and they are off to the next scene. In the book when they rescue Mr Tumnus they dance around for joy - in the film there are tears and hugs). Now, I can see how a country under the spell of a white witch for 100 years may not be a lot of fun, but its a long movie to sit through without some lightness. Even the crowning scene at the end is too uninvolved and not fun enough - where was the personal, the relationships ? It looked like a really dull party to me. There is also a very curious new scene, which doesn't seem to add much - involving them getting stuck on an ice floe as the snow melts. This takes up quite a bit of time for no apparent reason - I couldn't see how it added to the narrative, and again - the ice in the waterfall is grey, not sparkly and glittering. SO to sum up - good acting, interesting story - which took itself all a bit too seriously, and missed the point. Its a kids movie which has forgotten what its like to be a kid.","

"darkmoonnetwork375","28 December 2005","I have been known, both here and in real life, to be largely opposed to adapting books to movies, based on the notion that it cannot be done properly. I hated Lord of the Rings because of the many additions and omissions, I hated Harry Potter largely due to the same reasons and now here is Narnia. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is masterly done. With very few additions and omissions, this movie has become a near perfect adaptation of the book. There were some scenes cut short and some scenes added for a better flow but in nearly all instances, it has remained true to the book; both in spirit and in the accuracy of the narrative. It follows the movie almost fanatically. Albeit there are a few scenes which have been cut a bit short, it has left out no vital parts of the book and the few added scenes do nothing to ruin the experience. Many of the scenes, I think, that have been added, have been just that in order to convey some elements of the book. These elements are those, which are so typical of books that they cannot be successfully transported over the the silver screen without it seeming silly or even stupid.I give it a 10, because the film leaves you with the exact same type of emotion as the book did (indescribable to those who have not read the book) and you leave the cinema with a sense of faith. The book had you believe in Narnia as a world that might - or even should - exist and the film has accomplished the same feat. This will definitely show others in the future how to adapt books to film; and it serves as big and hilarious ""take this"" to Peter Jackson, as he was not able to produce a film so captivating and beautiful as this. An epic and beloved tale springs to life in such an impressive a beautiful way, that I think C.S. Lewis would have shed a proud tear, had he lived to see it.","

"dstarrboston","9 January 2006","A very satisfying movie. I read the book as a child, read it aloud to my children, and finally went to see it. The movie is a wonderful rendition of the book. The casting is right, the scenery is right, the costumes and dialog are right. The Talking Animals look right and sound right. Nearly all the scenes from the book are there with most of the C.S. Lewis dialog. There has been some talk about the Christian messages buried in the original text. They are still there in the movie, at the same level of intensity as in the original book. The intensity is so low that as a child I never even noticed the messages as I read the book. Rereading it as an adult, the message is plain to see, but not obtrusive. Neither Lewis nor the movie become preachy, it is a good, exciting, and well told action adventure movie. It comes out right in the end. If you liked the book go see it. If you never heard of the book, go see it anyhow.","

"RiffRaffMcKinley","1 September 2007","This horrid adaptation of C.S. Lewis' classic tale is a bland, cookie-cutter modern fantasy flick that makes shameless attempts to cash in on both Christian religious dogma and horrifyingly average special effects at every turn.The British TV versions from the '80s and early '90s were almost *infinitely* better. Here, Edmund is more than a self-absorbed brat; he's also a coward. And the White Witch is not scary-- she looks like she escaped from a very, *very* cheap porn film. And then there's Mr. Tumnus, who, here, comes across as some kind of creepy pedophile (hey, the White Witch does, too!). Not to mention the fact that Liam Neeson (while a great actor) is *no* suitable Aslan.Then there are the battle scenes-- oh wow. These scenes make Rob Zombie flicks look like cinema deluxe! Throw in some poor character animation and even more *dismal* performances and you've got yourself one insipidly *hideous* film.","

"tyrius_kaleva","9 December 2005","I recently purchased the unabridged Chronicles of Narnia and began reading them to re-familiarize myself with a tale I hadn't heard in well over 20 years.I eagerly read through to the end of 3rd book (A Horse and His Boy), and reviewed The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe before going to watch the movie tonight.I was absolutely amazed at how accurate and visually descriptive the movie was of the book. There was almost nothing left out of the movie from the book, and only a very little added. Except for the embellishment of a couple action scenes (which were extremely well done and very well gouged to the Narnian world), most additions were only to keep the pace quick enough to keep the average movie watcher interested.The only problem I had with the screen version, occurs at the very end, but its only a slight omission of what amounts to one paragraph in the book, (I was hoping the movie might have detailed this point). Maybe the sequels will add fill in more gaps later ;-).10 Stars all the way!","

"koltonbrett","28 December 2021","One word comes to mind when I think of this movie; magical. I'll never forget the first time I traveled through the wardrobe into Narnia with Lucy. I was completely enchanted by this new world. The snowy woods and the lamppost will always be one of my favorite images/scenes from a movie. I wonder how many children have wondered through wardrobes hoping to find such a magical place as Narnia. C. S. Lewis created a magical world of fantasy and Disney took one of his stories and created a masterpiece. These characters and places stick with you. It's hard to see a lamppost or snow falling in the woods and not think of Narnia. The scene where Lucy stumbles upon Narnia is done so well, we are filled with wonder right along with her. The characters are so likable and we get fantastic performances from a cast we don't get to see a whole lot of in other projects. Every line is delivered with such sincerity. I couldn't help but be moved at times by it. The battle sequences are epic and exciting and even emotional. The soundtrack compliments every scene and captures the beauty and emotion of each moment. Anytime I listen to the music from this film, it takes me back to this magical land, just as any fantasy movie soundtrack should do. As you can probably tell, a piece of my heart has been left in Narnia.","

"freakfire-1","3 October 2008","When I first heard about a film based on the books by C.S. Lewis, I was hoping something as good as LOTR by Tolkien. Those two ere good friends and thus maybe the films about their books would be in the same category of great movies. Not by a long shot The setup and imagery of the film are very good. Loads of well detailed places that can leave you in awe. The castle of the witch is nicely detailed and I thought the wolf guards were well done.However, the flow of everything else is lukewarm. The characters of the children are OK, but they are missing with those outside the children. Nor does the film explain a lot about the children, at least not in the beginning.Plus, the fights and battles certainly don't inspire much out of a person who loved LOTR. Instead, they were disappointing and mildly funny in a bad way.Overall, this is average. And for so much hype, that is not good. ""C""","

"dkncd","17 September 2007","""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is the long-awaited modern adaptation of C.S. Lewis' fantasy novel. Rumors of the film floated around for awhile, and no doubt the success of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies encouraged this film's production. The BBC produced three Narnia films in the late 1980s and 1990 that captured the stories nicely, but were lacking in quality special effects. This adaptation captures the story nicely and has the special effects to match. With modern CGI effects the filmmakers are able to render the creatures of Narnia to be more believable than the people in suits of the BBC movies. The film captures the land of Narnia beautifully and has a great score to complement the scenery.The casting choices for the film were appropriate. All of the child actors were believable, and so were the actors and actresses that played or voiced the creatures of Narnia. Liam Neeson is an apt choice to voice Aslan and brings the needed authority to the character. Tilda Swinton was also an excellent choice as the White Witch and is appropriately menacing in the role. I enjoyed Jim Broadbent's performance in his minor role as Professor Kirke.The film is faithful to Lewis' novel and develops the material well. The film's battle scenes were well-staged and paced. The story developed here is not an epic of the same scale of the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, but is an exceptional fantasy story none the less. ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" nicely captures C.S. Lewis' novel and I await the next film in the chronicles, ""Prince Caspian"", with great anticipation.","

I loved the music and the imagery that was used to bring this beloved classic to the big screen. Obviously, the director is a faithful fan of Lewis and kept the movie as close to the book as was possible. I'm really looking forward to the sequel and I hope that many others agree. All of the characters were played beautifully and I wasn't disappointed by a single one. Peter is the strong, yet still maturing, future King of Narnia. Lucy is the innocent, little girl whose curiosity leads her siblings into a great adventure. Aslan is the majestic, powerful ruler of Narnia whose guidance and love is essential to the children's journey. Overall, the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is certainly one of Disney and 2005's best movies.","

"gram_eno","9 December 2005","I believe this movie is as perfect as an adaption of The Lion,The Witch , and The Wardrobe that could be. The casting was perfect and the effects are pure bliss. This is not Christian propaganda ,it just takes the idea of a messianic archetype who gives his life for those he loves. It isn't selling theology its selling love. Thats not a bad thing to teach kids is it?Just because a writer uses his beliefs to be basis the moral under fabric of a story doesn't make it propaganda. If your going to complain about CS Lewis complain about Tolkien who was Catholic and that inspired his writing too. If you want to attack true propaganda attack Left Behind . All it is is just a cheap scare tactic to convert people. Leave Chronicals of Narnia out of the Propaganda label. Watch this film it will inspire you and its just a damn a Good Fantasy film and it is better than Harry Potter. This is one of the truly great fantasy films (equal if not close to Lord Of The Rings ) and it is for all ages. I can not wait for the sequels.","

In October, I saw the play at the Children's Theater, and I fell in love with this amazing story. So, when I saw the previews for the movie, I got really excited. Then, I finally saw it, and I was awestruck. It was AMAZING! The acting, the script, the effects, the overall mood of the movie was breathtaking. I, being an inspiring filmmaker actually got chills as the world of Narnia unraveled itself before my eyes. I knew as I was watching this movie, that I wanted to create the same effect for audiences. This movie is simply magical. Yes, it's a little childish, and yes it resembles some Lord of the Rings themes, but don't go into the movie thinking about those things. If you sit back in that seat and just watch the film, you will be flung into a magical and mythical world from which you will never want to leave. I wanted so bad to be inside of Narnia...I wanted to talk to Aslan...I wanted to fight the White Witch. In the end, that's what movies should do. They should make us WANT. They should make us WANT to be some part of the world that had been created for us. They should make us WANT to help the characters or in some cases hurt them. They should make us WANT to experience the film not just watch it. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe makes me WANT to do all of those things, and most of all it makes me WANT to see it again!","

This, in my mind is the best movie of the year and a best picture nominee for sure. I do not think that it will win the best picture Oscar though because it is only the first movie in a series of seven. Each book though, unlike the LOTR series, is a completely different story with many different characters. Overall, this movie is a must see and the next six will likely be the same. C.S.

'The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe' is a marvellous film, managing to be that rare thing - a movie which remains faithful to the book, realising the story with wonderful visuals and imbuing the film with real spirit.Based on children's books, the movie is a children's movie, (albeit fairly scary in parts!) yet all the story elements remain in place, with no dumbing down and little of the added sentimentality which so often chokes children's movies into cloying sweetness.The sets and scenery are magical, the children very well cast, the White Witch chillingly evil, and the animals and creatures which populate Narnia imaginatively rendered, including the majestic Aslan. Adamson has injected a sense of humour and a fresh look into an extremely well done adaptation, and created a film which will thrill both devoted fans and those new to Narnia.Loved it!","

"planktonrules","10 June 2007","Technically speaking, this was an excellent film. Up until very recently, doing a competent live-action version of THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE was really impossible because the special effects were technically impossible to do and still make them look real. Now, thanks to computers and incredible software, it is possible to get the look right of the book and Disney did a great job. And, having read the books, I was impressed that they got the story right. The problem for me, though, was that although everything seemed to fit just fine, the story itself didn't fully engage me. Perhaps I'm just getting old, but after this eye-candy was over, I just felt a great sense of ""is that all there is?"". The biggest problem related to this were that the LORD OF THE RING movies were so great, so grand and so wonderful that this left this film in the category of ""also ran"". You just can't help but compare the films and when this occurs, the depth and complexity of the Peter Jackson films is apparent.","

"cshighland","10 December 2005","The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe has been my favorite book since early childhood. This adaptation is true to the book and brings Narnia to life stunningly! There are very few deviations from Lewis's text - and those that are present simply move the story along more smoothly. Only uber-fans of the book will even notice the slight deviations. (I said, ""Hey, that line isn't quite right..."" It's that level of minor detail changed!) Using technology invented for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the crew of this film created all the amazing characters and events of the book in a most realistic fashion. My husband, Mr. Picky, thought a few of the backgrounds were too CG'ed, but I wasn't even aware of the effects - a sign of a very well-done CG film! The battle scenes were spectacular, and reminiscent of those in Braveheart, though with far less gore. (Note to parents: Be familiar with the book/story before bringing very young children. There be monsters herein, as well as battles and deaths...but nothing too gory. Just know what your kid can take!) I highly recommend this film to any fan of fantasy... Lord of the Rings fans and Harry Potter fans will NOT be disappointed. To Narnia fans, you absolutely MUST SEE THIS FILM! I know we plan to see it a few more times ourselves and we already plan to add this to our DVD collection the minute it comes out! 4 stars!","

As in, each person's heart as an individual. And by heart I mean your spiritual side, whatever you call it.At first, you're not even aware of your heart and spirit. (Before discovering Narnia)
You, as an individual human being, have 4 aspects or characteristic traits: 1. Bravery and leadership (=Peter), 2. Wisdom and rationality (=Susan), 3. Ambition and egocentricity (=Edmund), 4. Kindness and innocence (=Lucy).(Very much like the houses of Hogwarts)
The first time Lucy discovers Narnia represents having a spiritual or religious experience and finding out about your heart. While other people or your other aspects try to deny it, because it's not logical and possible.(Up to this point I thought the movie followed an existentialist view: because of the individualism and the idea of believing in the impossible for no reason. But then I found out about this:)
The heart is taken over by evil (=white witch) and you need to take it back from her.(Because there's no evil in existentialism, so I realized it's not the philosophical view of this movie)
Aslan is God and he will help you take your heart back and be good, and he is the real and true king of hearts.Ambition wants to go to the dark side to gain power if he's not controlled by your other aspects. At which point evil will kill him and destroy you and take over your heart forever.But Aslan sacrifices himself for each individual heart, so that you will be saved and the heart can survive the attack of the evil forces.(The writer has turned the story of ""Jesus sacrificing himself for all of humanity to save everyone"" which is a very collectivist idea, into ""Aslan sacrificing himself for you to save your heart"" which is an overwhelmingly individualist idea. Again, sounds a lot like existentialism.)","

"Alyoshevna","13 December 2005","There is much I could say in praise of this movie, but I won't repeat what others have already said.One of its best features, for viewers of all ages, is that it doesn't condescend to children. Charming as it was, SHREK -- from the same director -- did not expect children to handle much beyond a few familiar fairy-tale staples. THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE immerses them in a world wholly different from anything an American child knows: WWII England; the clothes, settings, and language of the place and time; Turkish delight, centaurs, even the ""wardrobe"" (which today would be called an armoire) and its mothballs. Many filmmakers wouldn't have touched this tale unless they could transpose it into contemporary America and either change or explain its alien elements. They wouldn't trust children to ""get it."" But, to children, all the world is new. They are ready, nay, delighted to enter into a wondrous, magical world and take it on its own terms. What they don't understand doesn't matter. What matters is wonder. The creators of this film trust their audience. The result is more thrilling than any dumb-downed, words-of-one-syllable version would have been.And the film is beautifully imagined. Most of us probably don't appreciate what it takes to adapt such a richly envisioned world to film: what to cut out and how to fill in what the author didn't describe. This movie succeeds remarkably. Its Narnia is true to C.S. Lewis and should be equally enthralling to viewers who have never heard of either.If the idea of cheetahs, minotaurs, children in medieval armor, and other unlikely creatures rushing together into high-stakes battle intrigues you -- if you've never grown too old for wonder -- this movie is for you.","

"tanyasing","2 January 2006","I took my 12 year old and 8 year old sons to this movie and we all enjoyed it immensely! What an awesome film! I had seen the older videos and this is much much better quality wise! So many really neat special effects and such a great story! There were places the audience laughed, and places that drew a tear to the eye, and places that had us on the edge of our seats! GREAT movie! I am sure it will be a timeless classic! The children who acted in the movie were very good and convincing as the main characters, and the White witch was scary and evil, but not so bad that young children couldn't see the film. I felt the scene with Father Christmas could have been done better, they went over it a bit too quickly. Aslan was so realistic! It made you feel as if a real Lion were talking! SO good! The battle scenes were very well done and so exciting. I highly recommend this film. It is so refreshing to see a family movie with no bad language or sex in it these days.","

"danyari","29 November 2005","What can I say ? I love the story since I was a child, a teen and when I become a man. If the director doesn't blow it, there are no reason for me to say that this movie is one of the best that I saw. And it is !!! The acting is superb, especially Lucy ( Georgie), WW ( Tilda ) , Tumnus ( McAvoy ). The others were just fine, but this 3 did a amazing job, they had enter the wardrobe for sure. The editing was amazing, the score is perfect, the landscape are just as I imagine, the figurine, make-up, everything!!! But, what really is out of this world is the visual-effects, WOW, Aslan is a real Lion talking, Mr and Mrs Beaver are great, centaurs, gryphon's, minotaur, all creatures are amazing. No more words for this. This movie had a profound meaning and a lesson that we should take for the rest of our lives. This is not a Harry Potter or a Lord of the Rings ( My favorite movie of all time by the way ) , this is Narnia. About the allegories and stuff, the movie will be what you want it to be, if you see Aslan as Jesus, fine, but this is a simple story about helping each other, courage and thrust in what you believe.","

"kevinscottbailey","9 December 2005","I watch new releases every weekend. I have seen almost every major film released this year. Narnia far outdoes them all. I was carried away by the breathtaking views, the powerful emotional undertones, and simply the fantastical nature of it all. I never thought a movie could capture the book I loved so much as a child. This one did so, far surpassing all my expectations. In all my years of watching movies, I have never been more enraptured with a film. Such a beautifully filmed, well-acted movie ... there are not enough adjectives to express how much I enjoyed this movie. It was well worth going to the midnight showing! I won't write a summary, or my take on the story as a whole, as I'm afraid I would give away too many plot points. Suffice it to say, if you loved the book, you will love the movie. If you've never read the book, you will still be swept away by the grandeur of the story, as well as the gorgeous film-making.","

"nablaquadro","28 December 2005","Normally, I'm never skeptical towards child-target movies, but I were (little) afraid to waste 5 euros in the ticket of ""The Chronicle of Narnia"". A big budget and good advertisement not always mean a success.What a great surprise ! The first 10 minutes, the rush during the war is emotionally stunning! I felt myself involved in the story since the first scenes, the sweetness of Lucy, the consciousness of the olders and the complex character of Edmund.Writers of the script deleted the blood and the cruel scenes (present in the original book of Lewis) to package a bittersweet gift for children and ""parents"" non-voted to bloody action. This is an aspect I appreciated a lot. Children (and adults too) don't need any additional violence than the ordinary aired daily on TV.An entire paragraph should be dedicated at the witch Tilda Swinton, a glacial actress I always loved in her past films; and her role in Narnia seems to fit her like a glove.I found ""The chronicles of Narnia"" very instructive principally for (another) war between The Good and the Evil, but the experience of Edmund and his redemption, the love between brothers (or friends) is an universal rule, in Narnia like in the real world. The crystal winter where the land is trapped, the repression against the fauns are a representation of totalitarian regimes raised in Europe before World War II - and the springs can be read as the return to the peace. Don't we forget Lewis wrote the books around 1950, when the memory of the World War II was living.All the actors, from the witch, the children and the minor characters fit their roles perfectly, giving off a sensation reality even in a queer world like that (inspired to the Italian city of Narni).The negative side of this movie, very little, maybe are the 140 minutes, too long for a child and some boring scenes. Anyway I enjoyed this movie very much and I surely recommend it for the families, the adults and for the Lord of the Rings lovers too !A must see.","

Its not in any ways offensive to any sane person.Its a fine tale of good vs evil made into a fine film, you will leave the cinema feeling like you've been to another land, and isn't that what a great film should do?","

"sgm-10","10 December 2005","When examined closely, most of the mud that is being thrown at this movie by the critics will be found to attack the established timeless classic work of C.S. Lewis itself with sales in the hundreds of millions of copies. So much for critics! The only real question left to us does not concern the story at all, but rather Adamson's rendition of the story. That being said, I can tell you that Adamson's inspired work with the characters of Lucy and Aslan, Walden's Special effects and Disney's resources have created a masterpiece of cinematic literature that I believe will prove to be as timeless as ""It's a wonderful life"" or ""The wizard of OZ"". It is tasteful and humane with no unnecessary blood and gore, and faithful in its rendition of Aslan, who does something wonderful not contained in any of Tolkien's trilogies.","

"barry_mooney","3 January 2006","I just saw this film last night and I have to say that I was very under-whelmed. Yes, it's a children's film - I know. But, other so-called children's films seem to entertain adults quite easily (most of the animated Disney films as just one example). I would concede that my enjoyment may have been spoilt by the fact that I was aware of the negative publicity surrounding the film. All the way through I couldn't help but notice the heavy-handed religious symbolism. The sickly-sweet sentimentality was also quite hard to wade through. For the first time in quite a while I found myself longing for a film to reach the end, which was pretty predictable and far from exciting - despite the impressive visual effects. My teenage kids thought it was OK and they didn't notice the Christian sledgehammer, which backs up my point that the publicity might have ruined it for me. I hear that there will be more Narnia films appearing in the cinema over the next few years - but not for me, thanks.","

The story was touching and powerful, the acting was exceptional, and the special effects were amazing! I was never been into fantasy movies until Lord of the Rings came out, which I thought was great. This movie was also very very good. From the beginning of the movie, I felt swept away into the story. I am rarely excited about new movies, but I was about this one, and it totally exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend this film. It is based on a kid's book, but it appeals to people from every background and age.I think we are witnessing the beginning of an awesome epic series! 10 Stars!","

"Lady_Targaryen","14 December 2005","This movie is much more of what I expected to be. Spite of many people saying that ''it's for children or young teenagers'' , I have to disagree and say that is a movie for all ages. Everybody who enjoys fantasy literature and movies, or never lost that special kid that exists in all of us will like this film.Narnia is different (and much older) than Harry Potter by the way.Without Narnia I really don't know if Harry Potter books (among others) would exist, since C.S. Lewis is one of the inspirations of J.K. Rowlling, the author of the Harry Potter's books. Spite some similarities with Lord of the Rings, the plot is different , and in fact, C.S. Lewis and Tolkien were friends, so I guess they both had mutual inspirations and mutual interferences in each other's stories. The reason why I am writing this is because I am tired of seeing so many people comparing Harry Potter to Narnia, and Lord of the Rings to Narnia, when the only thing they have in common is the fantasy genre.Many people also think that Narnia is an allegory for Christianity or for its message, because of the Aslan's death(meaning his sacrifice for Edmund) and his resurrection after that. This is making a big polemic as well, but I can guarantee that the series still has a strong and very beautiful story, even without the allegory.","

"measi","14 December 2005","My fiancé and I saw Narnia on opening weekend. Visibly, I thought it was a beautiful film. But something was missing in the plot-- it seemed too superficial and rushed to me. Granted, I haven't read the book in twenty years, so it's possible that the children would become instant friends with a lion they'd never met. Or perhaps it's just my adult mind looking at a childhood story where it doesn't seem plausible anymore. Plus, the ""main characters"" (being the children) didn't seem important as leads at all. They were just sort of... there.Tilda Swinton was wonderful as the White Witch. She has such a unique beauty about her that can go from elegant to fierce evil with just a change of expression. She sold me.I could see it being a fun movie to take the elementary age group children. But as adults, it was just okay and won't be on my DVD purchase list.There's something lacking in this movie... and I just can't figure out what it was...","

"divaclv","10 December 2005","Those who go to ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" expecting another ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Harry Potter"" will be disappointed--but it's their own fault if they are. Just as C.S. Lewis' fairytale kingdom is a different animal entirely from Tolkien's culturally and historically complex Middle-Earth or Rowling's strange-yet-familiar Hogwarts, so the films based on these three landmark fantasy series differ in style and tone and must be taken on their own terms. And on its own terms, ""Narnia"" is a delight.Like many stories in which denizens of our reality are thrust into another one, the opening scenes of ""Narnia"" are dark and dreary--it's World War II, the Germans are bombing London, and children are being sent to the countryside to ensure the future of the nation. The four Pevensie siblings find themselves relocated to a dusty mansion owned by a reclusive and eccentric professor (Jim Broadbent in a brilliant cameo) in a tiny backwater. The housekeeper tells the kids they are not to run, or touch anything, or in any way behave like normal children. It looks like they're in for a dull time--until youngest sister Lucy (Georgie Henley) discovers a wardrobe that opens up into Narnia, where animals and trees talk, centaurs and griffins roam freely and the entire country is on the brink of its own war between the evil White Witch (a chillingly cruel Tilda Swinton) and the lion-messiah Aslan (voice by Liam Neeson).Lewis was vocally opposed to a live-action film of his vision--but in his day, this would have certainly meant people in animal suits and puppets. It would be presumptuous to speculate whether or not he would have approved of this Narnia, but for my own part I found it enchanting. From the moment Lucy backs her way through a sea of fur coats and is startled to brush against a snow-covered evergreen, director Andrew Adamson and his production team strike all the right notes visually and emotionally, while avoiding almost all the inherent stumbling blocks. A key example is the scene where Father Christmas (James Cosmo) enters Narnia, after the Witch's magic prevented the holiday for a century despite an endless winter. This is a moment that could have easily been dull or ridiculous, but it works here, with Cosmo providing a ideal physical embodiment of the hope and joy that has languished under the White Witch's rule. Humor abounds--Lucy's first encounter with the faun Tumnus (James McAvoy) is wonderfully light-hearted--but chases and battles pack the necessary punch, and the climactic scene where Aslan fulfills a dreadful bargain with the Witch is perfectly chilling. The visuals are splendid, and the computer-generated characters are mostly convincing--Aslan in particular is rendered with the right amount of quiet majesty and dignity, which compliments Neeson's restrained yet authoritative vocal performance.Much has been made of the Christian parallels inherent in ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" but ultimately the religious undertones of the movie depend on the viewer. The allegory is clearly drawn for those who seek it, but it is not so obtrusive as to alienate those simply looking for a good family movie. With the wonders of ""Narnia"" playing right next door to the marvelous ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" young moviegoers and their parents have an embarrassment of riches this holiday.","

"bob the moo","11 April 2008","Sent away from the city to escape the bombing raids of the war, siblings Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy find themselves in the large home of Professor Kirke. Although bored out of their tiny minds, the older children are not so bored that they escape Lucy flight of fancy about a magical world inside Kirke's wardrobe. They don't, that is, until they stumble into themselves. Initially enjoying the frozen world of talking creatures, things change when the family are betrayed from within and find themselves key players in a war between the forces of good and evil for the very world of Narnia.Ironically enough it was perhaps a certain amount of fatigue from the Lord of the Rings films that made me decide not to bother with this new film series, even though I had read all the books as a child. I watched it recently on television though and must admit that, in the overall sweep, it does work. Technically it is impressive of course, with the effects being realistic and convincing throughout (well  as convincing as Ray Winstone as a beaver can be at any rate). The battle sequences and the creation of Narnia is all equally as convincing but yet it was not the design and visual delivery where I had a problem at all.No. Where I felt the film lacked was in the areas of heart and characters. The material is fine and I personally was not put off by the obvious themes from Christianity  although I can understand why some others might. If anything I was surprised by how dark it was with many characters being ""killed"" across the whole running time of the film. Problem is that it is only really ""dark"" in these very specific actions  not even ""moments"" but just in exact acts. This lack of depth sees the film be superficially enjoyable but offer nothing more beyond. Perhaps it is the comparatively short running time that does it but generally the film seems to be constantly moving forward but without ever taking time to sink its roots. For me this mean that I spent a lot of the film watching a spectacle rather than being engaging by a great story.The script is the clear weakness as it does focus on events rather than characters. In this regard perhaps it is telling that director Adamson has his background in visual effects and animated features rather ""films"". The casting process has not produced much to work with either, although in fairness the children do not have much to work with even if they had the range (which personally I do not think they did). Keynes, Moseley, Henley and Popplewell are all very English children and in this regard they suit the narrative and the style, however they do not have the range or material to deliver more than ""English children"". It is a shame because the film does feature a very strong performance from Swinton as the White Witch; she is a real presence and the film is never better than when she is on the screen. Broadbent, is OK; McAvoy is OK; Cosmo is OK; Winstone is fun; French is OK; Everett is a random but enjoyable touch but the best piece of casting is Madsen as the main wolf, his voice being very distinctive and mean.Overall then this is a technically impressive film that has plenty for the eye if you are looking for a spectacle. However if, like me, you are looking for something with depth, character and heart then this sadly is not the film for you. Having said that, I was not that impressed by the first LoTR film so maybe this series will find its depth with time and I will probably give it a few more chances to impress me with more than CGI.","

"mentalcritic","17 January 2006","One of the great things about fantasy as a genre is that it can be used to satirise aspects of our own world that we find repugnant. However, the trap of all fantasy films is that a certain grounding in reality has to take place. When a plot device is used, its function must be explained. When a character is able to perform a great feat, the reasons and means must be laid out. Before I go on, I should point out that one video critic laid out a series of rules for judging motion pictures by their titles. One such rule is that the longer the title, the worse the film will be. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a very, very long title. And in spite of having a special effects budget that would have had C.S. Lewis salivating, it becomes a very average, ordinary film. Then again, Lewis only gets it as bad as his more famous contemporary, relatively speaking.There is another saying in creative work that when you adapt something into a new medium, you inherit the source material's flaws. Lion inherits quite a few of them, not least of which is Lewis' childish conception of a fantasy world and how it works. Characters are repeatedly killed, turned to stone, or otherwise unpleasantly dealt with. Prophecy, magic, and general plot devices are used to undo all these events. Gee, a world where there is no conflict, no death, and no consequence. You can keep this world, mister Lewis, because it sounds like the same thing as being dead to me. Admittedly, it has been a while since I read the novel on which this extended Play School was based, but I do remember a serious problem with being able to deal with consequence or change there, too. I know this will come as a shock after I have talked about how fantasy epics such as The Lord Of The Rings suffered from the director's wholesale mauling, but this is one case where a big difference from the source material would have helped.Another amusing moment comes when a Santa Claus figure, riding a sleigh into the edge of a forest, hands three of the four children tools for their quest. He tells us that MoneyMas has not been celebrated in Narnia for a century, since the oh-so-evil White Witch came to dominate this land. The audience they are quite obviously aiming this film at might be too young to appreciate this, but as films like Bad Santa helped us appreciate, MoneyMas is only a celebration when you have succumbed to the brainwashing. So Jadis does not celebrate MoneyMas? Okay, get a fantasy creature army going on me, because I do not celebrate it, either. One more amusement is when Dwarrow are shown in the film as simply being diminutive Humans (and yet the presence of regular-sized Human children and adolescents seems so significant). Granted, this is Lewis' fantasy world and not necessarily meant to make physiological sense, but sending such creatures into battle does not tend to strike me as a good tactic.Unfortunately, it is the battles of the film that let it down the worst. After years of viewing such delightful films as RoboCop, violence without consequence easily equals boring to me. And as I indicated earlier, consequence does not seem to have been a word in Lewis' vocabulary. There is no situation from which our characters cannot be given a reset button. Nor, it seems, is there any blood when a five hundred pound lion leaps on a woman who has to weigh a hundred and seventy pounds, tops. And therein lies the fatal flaw that has killed every fantasy film of the past ten years. Lion tries so hard to appeal to that mythical audience of all ages, and winds up appealing to nobody. Tilda Swinton does her best to appear menacing, and she does a decent job in some sequences, to give her credit, but the script literally undercuts her at every turn. It would have been interesting to see how Lion and the next Harry Potty film would have clashed together at the box office, because heaven knows they are made with the same mindset.Words fail me when I try to describe the positives of this exercise in driving in the middle of the road. The film is slower than dragging a dead lion across a yard up to the end, when it suddenly attempts to give the sleeping adults in the audience some positive memories by staging a very ordinary battle sequence. To the credit of the director, he manages to resist the urge to shake the camera about, but the framing of shots is still nonsensical from the point of view of anyone who wants to see anything. To be fair, the film also manages to give viewers a sense of the chaos and suffering that drives the children into rural England in order to set up the action. It is rather amusing to hear Roger Ebert, a man who has been criticising films for several decades, describe Lion as a film sitting on the line between traditional family fare and some new kind of action-oriented family fare. To me, this is symptomatic of the MPAA's utter inability to recognise that there are adults in the audience, and they also have a right, as one expects when they pay obscene amounts of money, to be entertained.I gave Lion a four out of ten. I was gnashing my teeth over whether to give it a five as I gave Jackson's abysmal attempt to put half of The Return Of The King on the silver screen. I even said to another audience member that Lion was a better film, as it certainly had a better sense of pace and flow. However, I lowered the score to four when I realised that so too do most test patterns.","

But the movie is really good. This movie contains really tense moments. (Not spoiling, because every good movie has them.) The movie is a PG because no matter how much slicing or stabbing, the is no blood. Unlike the Lord of the Rings. But this looks quite like LOTR in many respects. And if you watch this movie, you'll see what I mean. I went and saw this movie today and it is long but a lot of it is fresh in my mind. It was a really great movie.

"TheMovieMark","9 December 2005","As quoted in the press notes...""And then she saw that there was a light ahead of her; not a few inches away from where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been, but a long way off...she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air..."" With that, C.S. Lewis sends young Lucy Pevensie into the magical world of Narnia. Likewise, once the big screen version of the wardrobe materializes, moviegoers follow Lucy into this alternate universe.That's the true beauty of Narnia - it isn't portrayed as just a figment of the children's imagination; it's a completely believable, imaginary world. C.S. Lewis never told the reader how he was supposed to perceive it; Lewis was content to leave a lot to the imagination. Even the final battle for Narnia is described in fewer than two pages.And that's the true beauty of the film - it takes the source material and fills in the blanks that had previously been left to the reader's mind. Visualizing in your head the fight between Aslan's army and the witch's minions is a joy for the creative, but watching a massive battle involving centaurs, minotaurs, dwarfs, giants, and a wide variety of other mythical creatures is truly a sight to behold.C.S. Lewis theorized that if a book is worth reading when you're five, then it needs to be equally worth reading when you're 50. The same holds for the movie - I gladly recommend this regardless of whether you're five or 50 or anywhere over, under, and in between.What makes The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe so accessible is its focus on topics that we can all relate to in some form - betrayal, forgiveness, selfless sacrifice, family, and loyalty. For Christians, the allegory behind the story certainly gives the film more meaning as Aslan, the Christ figure, battles the Devil's representative - the witch. But those who aren't as spiritually inclined will find this to be a great epic story of a battle between good and evil. The spiritual parallels are easy to recognize, but they're never heavy-handed.Fans of the book will notice that the movie has implemented some minor changes, and you may be puzzled by some curious exclusions (why was there no Giant Rumblebuffin?), but overall this is a faithful adaptation that should live up to and probably exceed your expectations. What is there not to like? The actors are great (particularly Tilda Swinton as the witch and the adorable Georgie Henley as Lucy), the CGI is remarkably impressive (Aslan looks very real!), the battle is genuinely exciting, the world of Narnia feels real, the creatures are given life without ever becoming cartoonish, and the moviegoer is treated to a two-hour vacation from whatever stress or hardships he or she may be enduring.There aren't a whole lot of movies these days that completely suck me into their world and force me to concentrate on the characters and the story rather than on the actors that I'm watching. Tom Cruise will always be Tom Cruise, and Angelina Jolie will always be Angelina Jolie. But for two hours Tilda Swinton is the evil witch, Georgie Henley is a little girl whose reactions feel real and sincere, and Aslan feels like more than just an impressive piece of CGI.This is exactly the kind of movie I want to see more of. Go see it. If you think you're too grown up to enjoy this and can't let your imagination get the best of you then perhaps it's time for you to, in the words of Todd Snider, grow back down.","

"farraak","6 January 2006","I've read the book and I had a clear remembrance of the BBC version of this story before going into the theater to see this film. I was ready to be disappointed. I kept hearing on the news and reading about how this is such a strong Christian allegory. I am rather angry that this movie was marketed only as that. First and foremost, it is a wonderful story of childhood adventures and growing up in a wonderful fantastical series of events. I am a Christian and I've known CS Lewis was a great Christian writer, and yes, the events in this movie may mirror that of Christian beliefs, but, it should not be called a Christian movie. I believe that this film has been done an injustice by telling people it is a Christian movie. It limits its audience and its capacity to inspire outside of the (sometimes rather closed minded) realm of Christianity. It is a work of art written for children. My eight year old kid brother does not grasp the Christian allegory and I don't think that he needs to right now. He loved the movie and the book. He likes Lucy because she is adventurous, he relates well with Edmund and he sees Peter as a role model. I've found him standing on his bed holding a play sword and pretending to fight in the great battle just like Peter. He sees courage in these children and relates to them. That is what this movie is about! Inspiration to overcome fear and see what you are really capable of! The Christian allegory is one event in this movie, and yes, it is moving as it reminds us all about Jesus, and I don't want to belittle that, but the people this movie will most effect are the kids. If you go to see this movie, take in the full scope of the story and don't focus alone on the Christian side. Every aspect of this film is filled with uplifting messages and they should not be missed while you are focused on the allegory. The acting is amazing, the set design is beautiful. The story stands alone as a marvelous example of hope and courage. See it for the enjoyment of a great story! Not for your religion.","

"shojun","8 December 2005","I have just returned from the midnight session of ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"". I read the books in 1991, so I could remember there being some wardrobe, and a lion or something, so wasn't sure how I'd find it. But turns out the memory is a great thing, and seeing, say, the lamppost, would instantly bring back the memories of the story. There will surely be many comparisons made between it and Lord of the Rings, and it's a shame that it comes out in the same week as King Kong, because it is a visually spectacular film with a compelling story that they've kept true to from the books, but is being overshadowed by the massive publicity surrounding the great ape. The animals created in the movie are incredible, especially the wolves, and while it is certainly more of a family-oriented movie than the LOTR movies, there were so many scenes where I wish I could have freeze-framed and just looked at all that was there - every scene was so detailed. Don't miss this one, plus you get to play spot-the-New-Zealand-landscape again :)","

"gas-7","12 January 2006","I have never read the book at all, so was completely unaware of the plot line etc. However, I was captivated by the story and the production itself. I thought all the cast acted superbly from youngest to the old professor. I liked the adventure, the humour and the scale of it. Great film, no wonder it is doing great business. I thought the young actors really seemed like a family, with typical sibling rivalries and interaction. THis was a great help in believing that Edmund would go off with the White Witch, having been annoyed by his brother especially. I loved the beavers humour, that gentle ribbing of one spouse to another. I thought the production design was great, with that medieval look to the tents, the armour etc. The terror of Aslan's sacrifice and death was a surprise and I though it was well handled. I am looking forward to the making of Prince Caspian - and I might get around to reading the books - or will that spoil my enjoyment of the next film - a good question!","

I am a big fan of Harry Potter, the books and the movies, and I love Lord of the Rings, the books and the movies, and The Chronicles of Narnia is one of the best films of the year.Many books that are taken to screen lose a bit in the translation, but this movie sticks to the book so well, with some great actors, the wonderful characters and a great storyline, and the battles are fantastic! This is a great movie for everyone, for kids, families, those who love fantasy, and I give it a 10 out of 10!","

"celo_cattus","8 December 2005","Let me start off by saying I'm a fantasy geek; I love the Harry Potter films and the Lord of the Rings films and was very excited when I heard Narnia was being made. Because of this excitement I was a bit sceptical about going in and being disappointed when I came out. I wasn't; I was surprised it exceeded my wild excitement. The CGI is fantastic; much, much better then how it looks in the trailer. I forgot all about Aslan being CGI and he really became the Aslan you see in the book; and as if it couldn't get better Liam Neeson does a kick-ass job as his voice too. The four children were fantastic, much better then the usual fare of confused kiddies that are awed at but not applauded at. Skander was the best as Edmund I thought but Lucy was excellent too. They all did a brilliant job though and so did all the other actors (Tilda Swinton deserves an honourable mention for embodying the White Witch in all her evil glory). The story flows really well and even if your a die-hard books fan you won't be disappointed. The only niggle was the part about the children being a lot more important then Aslan but it doesn't throw it in your face and Aslan is still a figure of much respect and awe.The religious undertones are there and are as present as they are in the book; many Christians will find the Stone Table scene very heartbreaking as I did and its easily the best scene in the movie.The music is sensational. I loved the Lord of the Rings soundtrack but this is much much better and different. Its all down to taste in the end but I found it more to my liking. The music at the start with the train is especially beautiful.What else can I say? The beavers were a definite highlight for me being both funny and serious; the fox also was an excellent addition although he wasn't very present in the book but he fits in very well with the story and makes sense. The wolves had the best CGI, next to Aslan, and though Maugrim was menacing you will probably find yourself awing at them despite them being villains. If I had to put in any bad points it would be that some parts are a little odd; for instance the scene after Aslan pounces on the White Witch made me think Peter was having an acid trip of some kind and the White Witch's dwarf also said the strangest things which will probably have you wondering if you heard him right. These don't distract from the viewing though and the Dwarf's weirdness is actually quite funny at times. First Class film and definitely one I will be re-watching for years to come.","

"sumpleby","13 December 2005","First of all, I want to say...let this film stand on its own merits! It is not Lord of the Rings reborn, nor is it the same sort of fantasy as Harry Potter. And while teens and adults will enjoy the film it is definitely aimed primarily at a younger crowd or ""family"" audiences. Some reviewers have called this film ""boring"" and I can only think that they are either trying to appear sophisticated or they are judging on the wrong level. I went the day after it opened; the theatre was completely sold out and, being a matinée, I would say that at least 50% (& probably more) were children ranging in age from preschoolers to age 12--but they were so mesmerized by the film that you wouldn't have known they were there. No fidgeting. No crying. No getting up & down. No talking. And when the film was over, the audience broke into applause which doesn't happen often.I went to see this film with a bit of trepidation: I had enjoyed the BBC miniseries years ago and doubted a 140 minute film could equal it. I am happy to say that I was wrong. Although the CGI is a bit shaky in certain parts (notably the centaurs) and the ears for Mr. Tumnus & the centaurs being done on the cheap, overall Disney and director Andrew Adamson have brought the fantasy world of Narnia to life so well you have no problem suspending disbelief for it.The casting of the child actors is, for the most part, ideal. Unusually for these times we are presented with non-bratty, non-smart-mouthed characters--a refreshing change. The young actors do a great job of portraying the more innocent, less sophisticated kids of the 1940's. Georgie Henley, in particular, is perfect for her role of Lucy Pevensie, evoking the wide-eyed wonder of a young child discovering a magical land. The scene in which she first discovers the wardrobe and then goes through it is well-handled by the director. William Mosely as Peter gives the weakest portrayal & the scenes in which he wields a sword are simply not believable.Tilda Swinton as the White Witch makes for an excellent villain. Her glacial stares send a clear message that she cares for nothing but herself and her own goals; her costumes distort her shape, especially around the shoulders & neck, giving her an inhuman look.Aslan, the CGI'd lion, is totally believable and Liam Neeson's voice can raise chills on your spine.Finally--yes, this story is a Christian allegory. If you are a devout Christian this film will speak to you. Aslan's death and rebirth in particular. However, the film works as a plain fantasy as well and if one is not a Christian (as I am not) the spiritual aspects don't get in the way.","

"ProfessorMovieMovie","9 October 2006","Awful dreck. I read the books as a kid and I really wanted to like this movie. But, I am sorry to say that I have been disappointed by the film makers.Whoever told these folks they had a good script for this movie? That person should lose their job immediately. It is CS Lewis, for God's sake, how on earth could they mess this up? The story of Narnia is rich, fulfilling and extremely gripping and entertaining. Mr. Lewis wrote a marvelous tale of fantasy and adventure that surely any trained professional screen writer could adapt into a marvelous movie.Not so the case here. This movie was full of boring clichés, idiotic dialogue, boring scenes of nothing, then too fast scenes where actions take place so fast you can not be sure exactly what is happening and why.These people should have studied The Lord of the Ring films. I mean for the cost of a weekend rental they could have had an epic movie making seminar and maybe they would not have ended up with this mess of a film that is right now playing in the background on my lap top.Writing this review is more entertaining than this watching movie. What is up with the acting in this movie? Seriously, not a good performance among the cast is to be had. Everyone seems as bored as I am right now. I just could care less about any of the main characters. Honestly.I will say the one thing I was impressed with was the lion. Good special effect. But that is it. The actor doing the voice of Aslan sounds like he is reading a long menu and can't decide what he wants to order.Well, watch it if you must. But you should read the books. As I said, they are fun, exciting, well imagined and written.I hope someone who knows how to make a great epic adventure film comes along and has a go at Narnia. And dear lord I hope these film makers have no plans to continue the series. They should all be fired.","

"g-bodyl","22 December 2007","I saw this movie about a week after Christmas 2005 in a theater. I must say that I am very glad I did. This is one of the best movies ever! This movie is adapted from the C.S Lewis book. The story tells a wonderful, but dark story of four kids who are sent away to live with a professor while London is being bombed by the Germans. There, the youngest child, Lucy finds a wardrobe and she discovers a magical land-Narnia. No one believes her until the family were forced to hide in the cupboard. Once they are in Narnia, they must defeat the evil White Witch with the help of Aslan the lion and all of the good creatures. This film is about close as the book as it could be. Adamson did a very good job directing. The kids were great and had very good chemistry. I liked the bond of the family. The CGI Animation was good as well. The talking beavers and Aslan looked very real and believable. The score for this film was good as it should be. It's very moody and unpredictable, which is a good thing. I recommend to not only Christians, but for everybody. I rate this film a 10/10.","

"bowlofcherrys","27 December 2005","To say this movie was anything but brilliant would be an understatement. My own reality seemed to vanish around me and all I could see and smell was this fantasy created by the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Each actor was outstanding, connecting with children and adults alike, from the innocent Lucy to the cold-hearted White Witch and brave Aslan. The computer generated images are nothing short of amazing and the truly intense scenes had me holding my breath in anticipation for what was to come next. I wanted to be in Narnia. I wanted to have a magic wardrobe. But most importantly, I sure wanted to see this movie again when it had finished.","

"elessar-12","17 December 2005","The scope and presentation of this movie alone make it spectacular. I (unfortunatly) haven't read the books in a couple of years, and even still, I knew what was going to happen - by far the best adaptation of a book i've seen in a long time. It was The Chronicles of Narnia, nothing more, nothing less. (This, unlike some fantasy adaptations of the recent past, was true to the books, didn't rely on special effects, interjections of humour, and actually had a 'comic' dwarf that was in character... impressive) Also a bonus is the fact that the director/screenwriter appear to be dedicated fans of the books themselves - the Witch's name (jadice), while appearing on the police notice, was never mentioned by Lewis until (I believe) The Magician's Nephew. As stated, the books are basically stand-alone stories with several reoccurring (albeit important) characters... hopefully the general public (those who aren't totally devoted to the books) won't lose interest.","

"m_mckechneay","4 December 2005","Although the movie's mood is much brighter than C.S. Lewis' book ""The Lion, the Witch & the Wardrobe"" - it's still not your average Disney-family adventure. For one thing the child actors actually look like people, not like surgically enhanced dolls (the actor of Peter actually really much resembles Englands Prince William...) - and they play pleasantly subtle. The decor of the world Narnia is not too fanciful and the lighting looks mostly natural. The CGI's are amazing: all the talking, running, flying animals - and especially the great lion Aslan - actually seem to have some weight at last. If it wasn't for the grand epic score that all too much resembles the ""Lord of the Rings""- Trilogy, this would be a likable enough. But the score is over-persuasive all through the film. It doesn't allow you a second to take a breath, think for yourself and makes you feel strained out after the first half hour or so. A contradiction in itself: how the images work so hard on creating a whole different universe. And the soundtrack/score at the same time works so hard on making it sound like any other blockbuster of the season ...","

"solson@lvrj.com","16 April 2006","I saw this on the recent DVD release and found it very weak. I've seen others here rave about the performance of the youngest girl. It seemed to me no matter the situation, all she did was present this forced smile which left her face empty of any emotion. The other end of her two color spectrum was the the crying, which seemed more like they just sprayed her face down with water and told her to make a pinched face, again devoid of any emotion. Actually, the performances of all the children were all weak and annoying. They did a horrible job in casting these children. I haven't seen child acting this empty since Star Wars Episode One.The pacing of the movie was horrible. There was too much time spent on small pointless scenes. It then moved on to seemingly large leaps in story line. I guess there was an assumption that all viewing this movie had read the book. But, I feel this created that atmosphere others have complained about. This movie is both too slow and too fast.I was never able to identify with any character in this movie due to the weakness of any development in both character and story. So, I just didn't care.The only thing interesting in this movie was Tilda Switon's hair.","

"gallowglas","3 January 2006","What to say? I truly expected more. Trying to please both adult and children audiences, I am afraid that Disney fell flat in between.Well, actually I cannot speak for the six-years-olds: They might love it and I wouldn't know, but then again the whole movie is so slowly paced that your average hyperactive kid is bound to loose track between two cuts. That's Narnia's biggest problem: It's plain boring. You just never get involved.I appreciate the effort Disney made to give more depth to the story: Peter's got more doubts about doing the right thing, Edmund is more of a rebel but simply a spoiled kid. Problem is though: kids (for whom Lewis wrote his book) won't know the difference while adults, who (like me) might appreciate a little more character development, may find many issues unresolved. There are movies that appeal to both young and old, but Narnia certainly does not join the fray.One more thing: ""Nice CGI"" refers to the animals, whose animation is sometimes short of outstanding. On the other hand there are just too many obvious computer graphics. Every other minute you get the impression of watching a video game. This might be due to somebody thinking that an impressive lion's fur carries a movie farther than a realistic scenery. Well, you can't spend one buck twice...All in all, I don't know for whom this film was made (certainly not for me) and I can find no excuse to recommend it.","

"sharron177","5 December 2005","When I was 17 years old I was given a trio sets of books written be C.S. Lewis. They were paperback. I just did not thought they made good reading, so it took me a couple of months before I read the first one which was called 'The Horse and his Boy' After the first couple of pages I just could not put it down! I could not wait to finish it, because I wanted to read the others. The next one I read was 'The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe' Reading this one is like I was there! I totally enjoyed reading those books. I then read 'The Silver Chair' My favorite is still 'The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe' It has been a really long time since I read those books but I can remember that about five years ago I saw The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe on the Disney channel but it was animated. I am so looking toward seeing it again because I know that it has such a great story line. C.S. Lewis really did his best on these ones.","

"pbp720-1","12 December 2005","I wanted to be generous and give this 5 out of 10 but this film really doesn't deserve even that extra star to rate it as mediocre.Let's start from the top: The film opens inside the bomber planes of Germans, dropping bombs on London during WWII. It next cuts to a scene of a mother frantically herding her four youngsters (the 4 who protagonists of the film) to their bomb shelter. In this scene, Edmund disobeys and runs back inside so he can grab a picture of his dad, who is fighting the war. There is a close call with a bomb, followed by Peter admonishing Edmund with the line ""why can't you do as you're told?"" (or something like that). This scene is followed by a long and boring goodbye scene at the railway station.On the one hand, I like the fact that these scenes place the story in their proper timeframe; essentially, they act as a historical backdrop to the tale. On the other hand, however, they're not precisely necessary. They're nothing that a couple of text stills or voice-over narration couldn't have accomplished. One might argue that they give the film emotional weight (or some such crock), but they really don't, especially since they don't really have any bearing later. In my cynical opinion, they're an excuse to give Peter something to say (the aforementioned line to Edmund) that he will say later (though not in any meaningful way); a popular Hollywood convention, apparently. Also, I might add this is a kid's book. Why the need to open the movie with such grim scenes as the WWII bombing of London? Again, unnecessary.However, this stands apart from the main story, so no real harm done...that is until they get to that main story. Changes are made, seemingly at random. Presumably they are done to enhance the drama of the story but all they really do is impede narrative flow and create scenes that are simply wrong. For example, there is a scene involving the four children in the Beavers' dam, getting the scoop on Narnia from the Beavers. Before this scene there is a scene with Edmund and the Witch, with the latter showing the former where her castle lies, between two hills, quite a ways away off in the distance. In the Beavers' dam scene, Edmund is shown to look at the hills, still quite a ways a way. Later in the scene, Edmund sneaks off to report to the Witch. His absence is quickly discovered by his siblings, who follow with the Beavers. It is quickly seen, though, that that prodigious distance to the Witch's house wasn't very great at all, as Edmund is soon shown to be at the castle, with his siblings and the Beavers close behind! Did I somehow miss the teleportation scene? I won't even comment on how this deviates from the book; the scene, by itself, is just ridiculous. In another scene, a fox (a character invented for the movie, as is the scene he is in) helps the children escape by throwing the pursuing wolves off their trail. On moment, the fox is telling the children and beavers that he will throw the pursuing wolves off, the next the wolves have arrived and demand the fox tell them where their quarry is. He tells them they went north, but it turns out that they are in the very tall tree towering over them. Again, I must have blinked and missed the crucial scene where the fox sprinkled fairy dust on the pursued.Then there's the problem of acting. The four children aren't terrible but they're not very good either. And two of them (the elder two) are made out to be whiners. I guess you can't blame them too much, especially as they're made to say and do things not in the book (they might have fared better if they stuck closer to the original text).But how do others, more experienced actors fare? Not all that well either. Tilda Swinton does not make a very good White Witch. In fact, she doesn't seem to know what to do with this role, underplaying it to the point of distraction. Also, the physical match between book and film is poor. Similarly, James McEvoy, paints a very limp portrait of Tumnus. No real conviction or anything of interest there either.The other main gripe I have with the movie is its mimicry of the Lord of the Rings movies. Lots of armor and weapons and posturing and clashing of armies. Unfortunately, it's all pretty dull and hackneyed (and, please...beavers in armor?)Overall, there's not much of a sense of fun about the film. Everything seems either overblown or underdeveloped. Too much effort has gone into making things look real and not enough into making things wondrous. For instance, a key piece of dialog by the Witch (one in which she calls out for the creatures in her army), is absent. It's moments like those that made the book so much fun that are noticeably missing from the movie.I don't mean to nitpick this film to death and come off like someone who thinks the movie should have followed the book to the letter. That is not precisely so, although I don't think there's any excuse for not doing so in this case. Sure, there are parts of the book that could have used embellishment or even improvement but there was no real need to drastically change or add anything. Wasn't the reason the Lord of the Rings (or book to film) couldn't be adapted faithfully that the books were too long? Well, there's no such excuse here.","

"piano_girl","7 January 2006","Very rarely does a movie leave me speechless when the credits begin rolling, but this one did. Where to start? Beautiful scenery, some truly extraordinary sets and scenes. The world of Narnia was superbly portrayed, with fantastic visual effects and animated characters.But of course it was the performances of the main characters that truly held up this film and made it what it was. The four lead children are all charming and highly convincing in their roles. It is clear to see they are all talented actors. They are all exceptionally natural and give truly heart-warming portrayals of their characters, displaying a wide range of emotions.Tilda Swinton is suitably terrifying in her role of the White Witch, and Liam Neeson's voice was just right for the role of Aslan. All the other characters, such as the beavers and the wolves, were all done fantastically, but I can't mention them all!From the moment the film started, with the dramatic music accompanying the air raid in London, I was gripped till the very end. Tears were brought to my eyes more than once, and I felt like bursting into applause in the middle of the film several times, such as during the battle scene - though I refrained for fear of appearing like a complete idiot.It is very difficult to describe one particular thing that made this film so appealing; it truly has to be seen to be appreciated. One of the best films I ever seen!","

"Leofwine_draca","14 May 2016","My main problem with this film is that I saw the BBC miniseries when I was a kid – and it made a BIG impression on me. These days, I look back on the schlocky effects and the overdone acting with a kind of nostalgia. I half want to see it again, to see how it holds up, and half want to leave it in the past, where it's probably better.This film tells the same story, for the modern generation. It's made in the mould of LORD OF THE RINGS and HARRY POTTER, and targets the same demographic. Intricacies of plot and character are done away with in favour of a chase plot that lasts the entire movie. Actually, that's not entirely true. The first half hour (the best) is a great set up – wonderful acting from the kids, good costumes, cool effects. The last half hour is a massive CGI animated battle sequence a la RETURN OF THE KING, and I loved it a lot – fast-paced action through and through, with minotaurs, griffins, monsters and dwarfs all fighting it out to the death. The middle hour isn't so good – we're stuck with cheesy talking beavers and some poorly animated wolf villains in a chase-capture-chase-capture sequence that seems almost interminable. We don't know much more about the kids by the end than we do by the beginning, except that Edmund is spoilt, Peter is kingly, Lucy cute and Susan is plain annoying! On the plus side, overall the effects are great, and there are some good voice actors in the cast – Liam Neeson makes a fine Aslan. Others, too are surprisingly great – old timer James Cosmo as Father Christmas, James McAvoy as Mr Tumnus, Jim Broadbent as the Professor, and of course creepy Tilda Swinton as the Ice Queen. If it hadn't been all so rushed and breathless, I would have enjoyed this a lot more, but it still makes for amiable viewing.","

"TxMike","9 May 2006","A lot has been made of CS Lewis and the Christian message that is contained in this story. I can see where one can make that connection, with the Lion, but it isn't by any means a necessary connection. While I enjoyed this movie, I don't find it great. For many of us there is a secret fascination with the idea of a fantasy passage into another world. We saw it years ago in ""Wizard of Oz"", we saw it more recently in ""Zathura."" There have been many fantasy stories with this theme. Here the youngest of the 4 Pevensie children, sent to a rural estate to be safe from WW II bombing of London, goes into a piece of furniture, a regular wardrobe, during a game of hide and seek with her siblings. As she goes past the various fur coats hanging up, suddenly and magically she is in an outdoor snow setting, nothing like the grounds outside the house. She quickly meets a faun, a strange looking creature that looks almost human above the waist, but had animal-like legs with hooves. She finds out she is in a land called 'Narnia.'Eventually all the children end up in Narnia, where it has been cold for 100 years under the rule of wicked White Witch (Tilda Swinton). Plus, the children find out they have the duty to help bring springtime to Narnia, and make things right again. Jim Broadbent has the small role of Professor Kirke, who lives at the country retreat. There are a couple of scenes where it appears that he knew about the passage to Narnia, perhaps even went there himself when he was small, but it is not treated in a definitive manner. At the end I didn't know what his role was in the whole story, if any. Perhaps fans of the CS Lewis books understand the whole story better. For me it was just ""OK"" entertainment.","

I have read the books since I was five or six years old. I love these books and this movie was amazingly true to the story. The changes made were effective and did not take away from the story. I am not afraid to admit that I cried at the beginning of the movie, and bawled as Aslan willingly and meekly walked to his death. I also cried as Peter and his army charged against the White Witch. This movie was so powerful. The story is an allegory of the Crucifixion story, with Aslan representing Christ. The children in particular Peter and Lucy were incredible and very convincing. I loved the beavers which looked so real it was amazing. The casting of Liam Leeson as the voice of Aslan was brilliant. Weta and ILM strike again the props, special effects and costumes were beyond description. I encourage all to see this film, but if you have any understanding of the Easter Story bring tissues because you will need them.","

"laurieloodles-1","26 December 2005","My family & I LOVED this movie. It was truly a great family movie. We didn't think it was too long at all, & would have enjoyed it even if it had been another hour long! My 10 year old had tears in her eyes on one part, but she still loved the movie. It was wholesome, exciting, adventurous & something that we wish Hollywood would make more of! This was one movie that closely followed the book, & we weren't disappointed in the least! I would recommend that all families go to see it! The ages of our family members: 43, 37, 24, 22, 21, 20, 13, 12, 10, 18 months. (Our 18 month old grandson wasn't into it though & had to leave with his mother).","

"view_and_review","14 April 2006","It could be that Narnia has had to follow up two fantasy hits such as Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, it could be that the book lacked in fire power, or it could be that the movie just wasn't done that well; but in any case Narnia fell short of expectations. Recently it seems to be en vogue to have children or teenagers playing the leads in fantasy movies (ala Frodo and Harry Potter), but what Narnia failed to do is make these children believable.There was no transition from these kids' innocence and ignorance into courageous warriors and saviors. In Lord of the Rings, Frodo and Sam were never sure of themselves and they constantly exhibited inexperience throughout their goal to save middle earth. Harry Potter was always in need of help and he was not even the best magician in his class. But in the prophecy rich Narnia in which four humans were foretold to save the land, it seems all of the prognostication forced itself upon the somewhat unwilling heroes. First the siblings are bumbling around Narnia trying to stay alive as anyone would do in a foreign land, and then seemingly overnight the older brother is leading a major battle, the other brother is an integral part of that battle, while the two girls develop fearlessness of the foreign woods they are in.The movie lacked intensity, there were never any white knuckle moments or hair raising events. The dialog was very generic and far from profound though one can infer that it was supposed to be, and the drama was mild even with the fate of an entire mythical land being in the hands of children. This was a kids movie dressed up as an adult one nothing more.","

"thomsonang","7 December 2005","I really enjoyed watching this movie, as did my daughter. While she has not read the book, many kids there had. It was great watching a movie that had both been read and enjoyed by most of the children and parents alike. I overheard one kid telling their parents, I don't remember that part in the book, I think they added it for the movie. It was neat to hear both of the parents say, oh yes it was, I remember that. While the story line itself captured the attention of most of the children, I know that along with the story, the special effects captured that of the adults. They were excellent. At the end of the movie, the parents were saying, that was a cool movie. I will say that some of the younger children seemed to get a bit antsy during the movie, as it may have been a bit too much for them. But there were few. I personally, can't wait to buy it. Disney did the book great justice and then some. It is a must see for everyone.","

"gradyharp","14 April 2006","CS Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia may very well have been a book intended for children but it was also the result of a life through the Great Wars and the effects those wars had one the individual. Gratefully in Andrew Adamson's directorial hands that part of the story that lends the need for the fantasy is preserved.The concept of separating children from their parents during the Blitz in London in WW II is now showing up in many novels. Lewis was one of the first to address the trauma these separations had on children. Adamson opens his film with some fine footage of the aerial German blitz and the terror of the Londoners running for bomb shelters. The family in focus is the Pevensie family - Lucy (Georgie Henley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Peter (William Moseley), and Susan (Anna Popplewell) - and these four children are sent off to a safe mansion owned by the Professor (Jim Broadbent). The mansion has a wardrobe that begins the fantasy, Lucy being the first to enter the kingdom of Narnia through the back of the wardrobe. Soon the four children are all together in the snowy place and encounter first a faun, then the Queen of Narnia/White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and there begins the struggle for domination and secrets that gradually resolve the mystery of Narnia, that mystery carefully paralleling Christianity through the forces of the kind Lion Aslan (Liam Neeson).The children are wonderful, especially Georgie Henley, and while the story deals with human creatures it is strong. As the various CGI animals enter (fine though they may be as creations) the tale for this viewer weakens a bit, but that is a personal response. In general with work like that from Tilda Swinton and Jim Broadbent along with the children, the movie form of Narnia is convincing and enchanting. Quibbles aside, it is a charming film.

"parisbrit","5 January 2006","... after reading Narnia as a child and with a daughter who recently read all the books in quick succession, we were waiting for a marvel of imagination and magic, and (why not) a few good special effects.The film was a total disappointment for all the family, from start to finish.Dull acting - overlong shots of the children showing standard expressions 1, 2 or 3 (maybe just 1 & 2)A total lack of expression by Timnis, the Witch and the Centaur (even Shrek had conveyed more emotion)Dull special effects ... we're spoiled by LOTR of course, but we do expect the Witch's palace to look a little bit better than sheet plastic in soft focus. The battle scenes would have been impressive to people seeing the film at the time of C.S.Lewis's writing in 1950 but not today ... sorry guys!In fact we wondered where the $180 million budget had gone ! If the sequel is in production, it's time to call in the auditors !!Recommendation : If you want Narnia, read the books.","

Lewis.At times I found memories of wonder and excitement surging through my head, as the story unfolded but having been long since moved to some dark and distant corner of my psyche.The children playing out gallant heroes portrayed the very essence of what the characters are supposed to be; executing their roles in natural and believable way.And although the film is full of special effects, it at no point relied on them to tell this classic tale.A must see, not only for our children but for the big kid that lingers in every one of us.Maybe tonight, as did when I was a child, I'll reach into the back of the wardrobe and firmly tap the back... Just in case.","

The cast is nearly perfect, the directing is superb, the special effects are among the most satisfying I've seen, and the script is terrific considering that the writers had to leave out so much of the book. I loved the characters of Lucy, Mr. Tumnus, and the beavers.My only hunger was for the film to be longer. I wish that that the tie with Aslan the Lion could have been developed more thoroughly before the emotional scenes at the end. Still, the film is wonderfully done and I can hardly wait for it to be released on DVD so I can own it.","

"The-Sarkologist","5 February 2012","It can be difficult to write a review on both the book and the movie in the same day. I read the book recently, but I am unlikely to pick it up anytime soon despite it being quite a good book, so when I watched the movie again last night I decided that as well as doing a review of the movie I would also review the book as well. The catch is that I am likely to go over a lot of the things that I have already gone over in the book, and I am not the type of reviewer that looks at a films technical aspects but rather at its content.I would probably suggest that this falls into the same content as what one would expect from a Hollywood movie. It has heroes and villains, and there is a movement to the climax where the heroes defeat the villain, save the world, and become kings and queens. However it is not so much the film but the underlying book upon which this film is based that I believe is important for considering the content. However, I would suggest that while it does not strictly follow the book (for that will be difficult in the best of cases) I do feel that it does faithfully stick to the themes that are present.This movie is basically allegory, though it is also a children's film, and the use of allegory can be difficult when we are looking at children. However, Lewis' original work was allegorical, and it was also targeted at children, though the theme of the book is really about redemption. This is the type of film that I would definitely show children, but I would also like to discuss the themes of the film afterwards, particularly the theme of redemption.There are two important elements to this film, that is redemption, and hope. The idea of redemption focuses entirely on the character of Edmund. To put it simply he not only betrays his siblings, but in doing so he betrays Narnia, Aslan, and of course himself, and it is all over lust for Turkish delight (which is allegorical for pleasure). The White Witch is an allegory of Satan, in that she holds Narnia in her grip and drains all that is good and pleasant from the land (as is represented by the enternal winter). When she first appears she treats Edmund as if he was important, and showers him with gifts, but upon taking the gift, he comes within her power, and it is only through the sacrifice of an innocent (being Aslan) that rescues Edmund from her grip.The idea of hope is also present, and that is represented by the appearance of Father Christmas halfway through the film. While the film does not paint him as Father Christmas, it does become noticeable that this is what this character is supposed to be. Christmas falls on the Winter Solstice, meaning that it is the shortest day of the year, and also heart of winter, when everything is at its bleakest. However what Christmas tells us is that the worst is over, and we now have Spring to look forward too. In the film that is demonstrated by the snow melting and green shoots appearing. It is allegorical of Christ's first appearance in that it is said he came at the deepest and darkest point of human history. The Republic had collapsed to be replaced by the Roman Imperium, and everybody was under the yoke of the emperor. While things did get worse, what Christ's appearance heralded was the arrival of hope, hope that there is more to the pain and suffering in the world, and that there is a God who loves us, cares for us, and wants an intimate relationship with us.","

"gcn122","12 December 2005","It's been about 40 years since i read the books. They were among my favorites ever and while reading them, my visual mind made up its own movie. So i was uncertain about going to see this movie. But it's perfect. It's all the images i saw in my head and more. It's brilliant. I'm a very critical person about entertainment and literature. But i'm hard pressed to come up with one thing i didn't like about this movie. Maybe the choice of adult actors in the first sequences, but they weren't very much part of the story. The battle scene at the beginning was really well done, better than most depictions of England during the war. At first i thought the witch wasn't working but, wow, she really got better. The centaurs are the best Hollywood's come up with yet. Completely believable. As are the fawns. Great. But the most important part, the one i was most worried about, was the lion. And he was perfect. Wonderful. Awesome. This movie should win all the prizes.","

"mnpollio","9 August 2008","I have never read the C. S. Lewis novel from which this film originates so I am going in cold and judging the film on its own merits and have no idea how closely it adheres to its source. The film starts off quite well with a lot of potential, but somewhere along the way misses its footing and ends up delivering a rather empty viewing experience. The end result fails to achieve the emotional depth or scope of Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy (films it appears to want to emulate), the imagination of the Harry Potter films, or even the ambition of the more recent The Golden Compass. The opening is fascinating and sets the stage nicely, taking the four central characters - two brothers and two sisters - from war-torn London to a more pastoral setting. The youngest child, played by the adorable Georgie Henley, stumbles onto a wardrobe that opens into another realm filled with talking animals, ice queens and epic battles of good vs. evil. Naturally, she compels her siblings to return with her and aid the forces of good - embodied by a wise, noble lion voiced by Liam Neeson - against the forces of evil, led by Tilda Swinton's queen. Unfortunately, it is around this point that the film begins to falter and lose its initial impact. The visuals range from good to merely adequate, with the battle scenes particularly smacking of CGI phoniness. Purportedly there is some pro-Christian agenda at work in Lewis' novel, but one really has to stretch to find it in the film as it just never seems that deep - in fact, it is amazing how quickly the film evaporates from the mind after it concludes. Swinton is suitably malevolent as the queen, but despite that none of the characters ever truly seem to be at great risk from her, which results in a veritable dearth of suspense. By contrast, Neeson appears to have become entombed in the role of wise mentor and desperately needs to stretch himself. He has become a veritable cliché. James McAvoy is charming as an impish faun who befriends young Henley, but then he is off-screen for far too long. The biggest problem lies with the central characters. The film works well when the emphasis is on young Henley, who is the most appealing and accessible of the siblings. Unfortunately, the second half punts her into a supporting role in favor of Skander Keynes, as her conflicted brother and the younger of the boys. Keynes's role requires some degree of acting prowess to carry one over the contortions his character is forced to go through during the running time, but he seems to only have two reactions - very surly and slightly less surly, which confounds any evolution. The older siblings have it even rougher. Blond pretty-boy William Moseley seems on hand only to appeal to the teenyboppers in the bland hero role and the film/story never seems to know what to do with the older sister, played by Anna Popplewell, so she instead just seems...there, like a prop. And therein lies the film's problem as a whole. It ends up performing the same function as a Christmas gift box wrapped in sparkling paper that holds nothing inside. It is lovely to look at for a short time, but then one is ready to move on to something with substance.","

Both types of audiences will enjoy it.It's worth seeing: The acting is good by whoever plays Edmund, the younger son and Peter the older one, and Lucy's character was cute and believable.C.S. Lewis would be proud of his series' adaptation. I just hope they'll continue to make the rest of the books into movies because it's greatly entertaining.","

"ccole-7","9 December 2005","Narnia: a world created in the mind of C.S. Lewis and transferred onto paper to be shared with the rest of the world. For the longest time it was believed that his world, along with the world of fellow Inkling J.R.R. Tolkien could not be done any justice on a two dimensional screen. The imagination of the writer in combination with the reader was by far superior.However, both worlds have come to life in a big way. Thanks to some spectacular CGI characters and landscapes, Narnia has been transferred from the pages of this beloved children's series onto the big screen.Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie are sent off to the countryside during the bombing raids over London. They are taken in by a professor, and find his house suitable for playing hide and seek. During the game, the youngest Pevensie, Lucy, discovers a wardrobe and finds her way inside, only to be transported to the land of Narnia.While there, she meets one of the Narnian's, a faun named Tumnus. He tells her why Narnia is in the condition that it is, and then allows her to go back to her world.Lucy then tries to convince everyone else of this world, but nobody believes her. Edmund is the next one to find his way into Narnia, and meets Jadis the White Witch. After giving him something to drink and some candy, she sends him back to bring his brother and sisters to her.It then happens that one day all the children find themselves running for cover after a mishap into the wardrobe. It is then that the adventure begins.Other than some scenes where it was obvious that a green screen was used, the integration of live action and animation was simply amazing. The mythological creatures not only looked real, their movements were fluid and extremely believable. And considering the cast was made up of mostly unknown names (other than a couple big names) the acting was superb on all counts.It may not be a film quite on the scale of Lord of the Rings, but make a note that it is a franchise well on it's way for years to come.","

"totalangel33","9 December 2005","A brilliant performance and adaptation of the novel. The casting seemed to be perfect and the scenes were fantastically visualised, and executed. Even the light hearted humour from the Beavers, was vastly appropriately and fitted well into the believable land of Narnia.The CGI was fantastically fitting to it's surroundings, it did not feel like they had blown the entire budget on trying to impress the audience was tricks and effects which, happens in so many other movies. Every aspect seemed to be considered equally and carefully. (Although there was a cheetah at the end with glasses drawn on his face...mistake?)Never before have I felt the emotion which drives this story, from the start to the end (even although I knew the story well) I felt an emotional understanding with all the characters. The subtle symbolism hosted throughout the movie added so much to the story and felt like I was being told the story for the first time.","

"jburtroald95","8 March 2009","Many years ago a great literary genius captured children's imaginations with an astonishing fantastical masterpiece inspired an old vision of his in which a faun was standing in the snow holding an umbrella.In 2005, Disney  after watching for years the excitement and wonder that the Harry Potter adaptations had conjured up - became jealous of Warner Brothers for their incredible ability to create such an incredible fantasy series that people of all ages could enjoy and used this novel to try and do the same.The results are ghastly, clearly all these people are interested in is making just another depthless action blockbuster and since they can't be bothered coming up with their own story they've borrowed someone else'. Here we see that in chasing this nightmarish dream the director  Andrew Adamson  has abandoned the story, the richness, the warmth and the characters and left them to rot while he tries to cook up an entire film based purely on special effects and stunt work. Well I must say he's failed at that, the cheaply done CG animals are so lifeless and fake that they make plastic figurines look like the real thing. The same can be said for the painfully numerous action scenes which are slow, irritating, completely unnecessary and appear to be merely dodgy tricks to fill in time.The cast is almost no help at all; most of them give such bland performances that the marvellous array of different characters just becomes one big tedious mess. I doubt any of them have even read the book let alone understood it, and they seem to have just gone with the obvious stereotype. The best example of this is the clueless Tilda Swinton, who gives such a revolting performance that she should have her Oscar confiscated. Jardis is a tyrannical monster of a woman that seeks to control all of Narnia no matter the cost, Swinton turns her into a harmless ditsy little fairy princess.Though that said there are a few exceptions: Georgie Henley is just perfect as Lucy, the young actress portrays the character with all the sweetness, innocence and vulnerability that she deserves; James McAvoy does show the tentative, emotional and brave sides of Mr Tumnus very well; and Jim Broadbent does a fair job in the role of the professor.But all in all this is nothing short of pathetic, aside from those three actors there is not a smidgeon of talent to be seen in any areas of this film and it is a terrible adaptation of C.S.Lewis' treasured rare gem.However, devoted fans of the book do not despair: there is a splendidly done 1988 BBC television adaptation directed by Marilyn Fox and starring Sophie Wilcox, Jonathan.R.Scott, Richard Dempsey, Sophie Cook, Barbara Kellerman and William Todd Jones.","

"ShootingShark","2 January 2009","The Pevensie children - Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan - are evacuated from London during the Blitz to a rambling country house. There they discover a magical wardrobe which leads into a mystical land called Narnia, where it seems they are destined to free the inhabitants from the tyranny of a cruel witch This is the first theatrical filming of C.S. Lewis' classic fairy-tale, and is the faithful, big-budget, spectacular imagining it deserves, as Narnia with all its talking beasts and myths and legends are brought vividly to life. It captures the essence of the story well, as the children stumble into the adventure and shudder with anxiety and disbelief as they learn that they are monarchs in waiting, expected to do bloody battle to save the kingdom. It also doesn't water down all their faults; Lucy is sweet, but Edmund is greedy, petty and jealous, Peter is pompous and stiff, and Susan is just a bit boring. Henley and Keynes are both very good as the younger children, Neeson is an inspired choice for the voice of Aslan and McAvoy is terrific as the faun Mr Tumnus. Swinton is odd as the Witch; her blank, imperious looks are ideally suited and she is suitably nasty, but she never quite dominates the proceedings as she should. I guess this isn't my favourite fable - it's well written and imaginative, and I like the religious allegories, but I tend to agree with the criticism of Lewis' writing as too conservative and morally superior, which is reflected in the film. It does have a great score by Harry Gregson-Williams however, and was shot in a myriad of differing locations - the Czech Republic, Poland, New Zealand, Los Angeles, Shropshire and London. All in all then a mixed bag; a spectacular but not entirely successful adaptation of a terrific yet flawed children's classic. It's a treat to watch, but not nearly a match for Peter Jackson's J.R.R. Tolkien films or the Harry Potter movies in my view. A word on chronology; this was the first of the seven Narnia books (written in 1950), but the events of the prequel, The Magician's Nephew, take place before it. This movie has since been followed by a film of Prince Caspian, which is the fourth book chronologically, but was the second to be published. Confused ? The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe was first filmed as a British TV serial in 1967, then as an animated TV-movie in 1979, and then again as a BBC serial in 1988.","

"Paul1149","8 May 2008","I wanted to like this movie, but at almost all times I was aware that I was ""watching a movie"". It never really moved my soul. The acting was frankly very bad. The emotional depictions were worse. The screenplay wasn't great either. The scenery, the special effects, however - with the exception of most of the animals' talking - were good. I began to hope that the appearance of Aslan would save the film, but he was a disappointment as well. The majestic King seems like a big stuffed toy from FAO Swartz.The whole thing comes off as childish. I often thought that it would be OK to pass this movie off on a kid, but not an adult. Even the classic lines at the end, ""After all, Aslan is not a tame lion / But he is good"" simply had no power whatsoever.In the inevitable comparison to the amazing Lord of the Rings trilogy, there simply is no contest. That's a shame, because the Lewis writings are truly superb and deserve far better treatment. Now that this version is done, it will serve as a firewall preventing a better interpretation from being done for a long time.As I said, I wanted to like the movie. Not only do I enjoy the richness of the original story, I love its Christian underpinnings as well. I remember years ago being genuinely moved by a simple animated version of this story, especially the scene of the death of Aslan, where there was a holy silence that descended not only on the land of Narnia but on my own heart as well; but this expensive production barely stirred me. It may well be that Disney is simply out of its depth with this kind of rendering, that its massive corporate group-think actually works against producing an artistic work of this kind when using real actors rather than pictures.That's sad, for what could have been but is not.","

The biggest down fall of the movie was the poor CGI, you tell something were very fake.

"bregund","4 May 2008","Like many other reviewers, I read the series of books years ago when I was a kid. Lewis's writing has a light touch that is easily read and understood by children, and the deeper messages are there for anyone who looks for them. For children, his writing is bold and exciting, and stepping into Narnia for the first time is like a breath of fresh air: the characters are rich and sharp, and the scenes are clearly portrayed. The Chronicles of Narnia are not just a work of escapism for children, but at their heart they represent an idealistic moralism that, unfortunately, many religious people have claimed as their own, when in actuality they stand on their own merit without any reinterpretation by religious nuts. Lewis was keenly aware of how his work was viewed, and never intended his children's books to be interpreted as metaphors for religion.That said, there is something about Lewis's excitement and sense of immediacy that is sorely lacking in this beautiful but flat film. It all seems kind of cheap and slapped together somehow. Where Lewis describes Narnia in terms of its newness and its impression upon the Pevensie children, Adamson the director fails to convey this excitement on screen. The characters are flat, one does not feel their sense of wonder at this new world, and in no other recent movie that I can think of has it been more obvious that the actors were tired of standing in front of green screens conjuring up reactions to things that are added in later during post production.The special effects are ho-hum. The waterfall scene, for example, went on far too long and contributed nothing to the story, on top of looking like a scene out of a made-for-TV movie. Aslan is particularly hokey, with his fur that doesn't move like the fur of any other lion in the world, and it doesn't help that Liam Neeson's forced, creepy voice is meant to impart the deep wisdom that Lewis so carefully portrayed in the book. I hear Liam Neeson and I think of his tongue-in-cheek role in Darkman, and it kind of blows the whole Aslan thing for me.One might expect that the icily beautiful Tilda Swinton was perfectly cast as the white witch, when in actuality most of the time she appears as though she can't remember her lines. The best actor of the bunch is Georgie Henley as Lucy, a natural born actor if there ever was one.All in all, a disappointing effort from what was probably a collaboration by hundreds of people and millions of dollars, desperately trying to inject some humanity or heart into a film composed largely of poorly rendered computer graphics.Lewis would probably have walked out of this film, shaking his head and thinking ""oh well, children can still have a much better time reading the book. Long after this movie is forgotten, they will be reading the book.""","

"Falconeer","11 August 2006","The problem with Disney is that they try way too hard to sell the product, to rake in the big bucks, and it is quite obvious when one watches this ""epic."" While the cast is quite good and attractive, too much just did not work here. Why does Disney always have to include the standard ""talking animals doing the stand-up comedy bit?"" The wolves looked good, genuinely scary, until the lead wolf started to talk. He sounded as menacing as Richard Simmons. I guess the guys at Disney were afraid that if they included any scary or intense moments at all, then the parents wouldn't shell out the bucks at the movie houses and then at the DVD store. Everything was so fanatically politically correct. No, the oldest boy could never stab the wolf that was about to eat his brother and sisters. The wolf literally jumped on the sword. I am not saying the film should have been filled with the same frightful images as the thousand times better LOTR. But this limp adaption of a classic children's book is just disappointing. Every commercial stunt was pulled here to ensure big numbers at the box office. I hate this kind of movie-making. And even more, i miss the days before computer imaging replaced real special effects, or real anything for that matter. Why build a magnificent kingdom, even if it is on miniature scale, when they can simply super-impose the image onto the screen? It must save the studios billions of dollars. The only problem is, it looks like crap. It was obvious that most of the landscape was simply not there. Personally if i want to look at this kind of thing, I would prefer simple animation, classic Saturday morning cartoons. I suppose after the cinematic milestone that was Lord Of the Rings, it will be quite difficult for anything to live up to that films grandeur. And perhaps computer imaging was used in LOTR, but it was done so much better. The landscapes, the cities, the million plus armies, actually looked real for the most part. I guess however, that kids will love ""Narnia."" Most kids are fairly easy to please. Look at all the junk on TV every Saturday morning! This one is a disappointment.","

"dunmore_ego","22 August 2009","Four bloodless, pasty-white British kids on an adventure in a magical wardrobe.Set during WWII, young teen and pasty Brit, Peter Pevensie (William Moseley) and his younger, pastier siblings, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, discover a wormhole in a wardrobe, leading to a land of eternal winter and constant special effects called Narnia. Two factions battle in this land (where every animal speaks English and is either CGI, or a human in heavy makeup): ""good"" animals pander to Aslan the Christ-y Lion (voice of Liam Neeson, who does more acting as this lion's pixels than in all his screen time on PHANTOM MENACE), and ""bad"" animals aid the White Witch (Tilda Swinton, badly in need of a boyfriend or a vibrator).The pasty Brit kids join Aslan, except for Edmund (Skandar Keynes), who is tempted to the side of the White Witch with Turkish Delight. (If there was any more evidence needed as to how infrequently these pasty kids get out in the sun or get out of the house at all, I think that Turkish Delight scam should tell you all you need to know.) Also starring James McEvoy as Mr. Tumnus the Faun, James Cosmo as Father Christmas, Rupert Everett as a Fox, Jim Broadbent as Professor Kirke, and Ray Winstone as The Beaver (yes, I meant it to sound like that).There are spectacular sights in CHRONICLES - centaurs and moving statues and mythical muscled beasts - which will no doubt entice the kids, but the messages of good versus evil come across loud and unclear. Just like a Disney movie on steroids, the contradictions and all the insufferable prophesy just make us feel stupid and dirty and insulted.For example, Edmund constantly betrays his siblings, yet is brought back into the fold after Aslan gives him a stern talk. We don't hear the conversation, but we'd like it to go something like, ""You do this again and I will rip your limbs from your torso and make you watch me bitchslap you with your own limp wrist!"" but we know it would be closer to, ""That was very bad, Edmund!"" No lessons learned in earning absolution, or even getting the snot kicked out of you as retribution for being an utter Benedict Arnold.It is no secret that author C.S. Lewis was an indoctrinated insane person, i.e. someone who believed fervently in Christianity. So no surprise when Aslan gets all allegorical and sacrifices his life for the sins of others - and is resurrected. How very Jesus of him. And then there's Santa Claus - the OTHER Jesus.Father Christmas (called ""Christmas"" even though Christ never visited Narnia) bequeaths the Brit kids weapons, even though his credo is ""War is an ugly affair."" Thanks, Santa - leave the hardware and sod off! When Christmas hands an archery set to Susan (Anna Popplewell), and she asks, ""What happened to 'War is an ugly affair'? he just chuckles and changes the subject! Piling stupidity on stupidity, these ""magic"" weapons supposedly ""work every time,"" so why does Susan bother ""getting in some practice"" with them? And if they are NOT magic, getting in ten minutes of practice is not going to save your pasty British arse.But we find that standards are pretty low out here in Narnia - all it takes for Peter to be knighted by Aslan is for a wolf to jump at him and for his sword to be in the way. Suddenly he's ""Sir Peter Wolfsbane."" Now... if the weapons are magical, then what credit should Peter take for the sword killing a wolf? These kids don't earn one whit of their ""battle"" experience, yet they are lauded throughout the story as prophesied saviors of Narnia.How come, in any prophesy-heavy fiction (REVENGE OF THE SITH, LORD OF THE RINGS, The King James Bible), no one ever admits to a prophesy being unfulfilled, thereby proving what a load of bunkum it is? The fact that the White Witch's wolves speak the King's English makes them less scary. It means they can be reasoned with. That doesn't seem to stop the kids doing one stupid thing after another: in an effort to stop an ice floe from melting, Peter stabs his sword into the ice to use as a handhold - but wouldn't stabbing the ice make it split exactly where he stabbed it? Instead, they all hold onto this lever and ride the rapids away from the wolves.When they exit the freezing river, Peter, who was holding onto little Lucy by her jacket, now only holds her jacket and has lost Lucy. Susan looks at Peter and cries out, ""What have you done?!"" as if he meant to lose her on purpose. While I'm busy looking at Susan, all wet and cold, looking pretty damn hot - in a stuck-up, Catholic School kinda way.Silliness continues to the end of the movie, director Andrew Adamson hoping he can sweep it under the banner of ""kid's movie"" and throwing action battle at us like beaver at a strip club. But like Disney's debacles, the treacle runs so thick it will choke children on unreality before they can enter the real world, wholly unprepared to be choked by its reality.Like LEAVE IT TO BEAVER with better special effects. And actual beavers.---Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).","

"AlanJ2","8 December 2005","Who could ever have believed Disney would do it? Make a faithful, magical, complex, touching, funny and exciting screen version of Lewis's children's classic. But they have. What is so terrific about this film is that the children--all portrayed with remarkable unfaked authenticity--beautifully portray the tensions and problems of any siblings. We feel their difficulties, their rivalries, their problems--not manufactured movie-type problems but the usual conflicts apparent in any family. And the tensions between them mirror the split in the magical world in which they find themselves. I never dreamed that one of the very greatest children's books could make it to the screen in such a consummate way. Tilda Swinton is superb as the White Witch and the story, built around a great human myth that is not necessarily or exclusively Christian, is simpler and finally more satisfying on a human level than 'Rings;. Oh and Harry Potter' pales by comparison. This is a hundred times more enjoyable and more original than 'Goblet'.","

"Spuzzlightyear","9 July 2006","Let me say up front. Narnia was a great movie. Full of cool special effects, great performances (I especially like Tilda Swinton in anything she does) and just the overall feeling one gets from the movie. But then, just dissecting it, and figuring out what it all means, was my next step. I mean, the biblical connections were obvious. But then I started thinking about the closet (well, the wardrobe) and then I wondered..Is Narnia one big gay film? The kids go into the closet, close it, and are instantly transformed where everything is magical (and excuse the expression fairy-like) where everything is wonderful, just as long as you keep everything closeted. Oh yes, there will be people like the ice queen (read neo-conservatives) that will try to put a stop to the magic, so we'll have to band together to fight the bigotry!","

"areatw","28 October 2018","Film adaptations of classic novels often prove controversial and divisive, but I think this is a good example of how a classic fantasy adventure novel can be succesfully turned into a film while retaining everything that made the original book so popular. Taking on a special book series that brings back positive childhood memories for many is always risky and I think this film deserves a lot a credit for largely capturing the magic of the novels.It's a very well-made film, with impressive CGI and special effects, beautiful visuals and scenery and a great cast, but perhaps the most impressive part of this film is how it remains loyal to the original story. The temptation would have been there to chop and change to make the plot more screen-friendly, but keeping it as close to the original story as possible was definitely a wise choice. As fantasy/adventure films go, this has to be one of my personal favourites.","

It all looks so real that you would really believe that Narnia is an actual place. The plot is awesome and it really stirs emotion.

"annegirl8","16 December 2005","Let me start by saying this, I am in no way attacking the story itself. I love these books and I think C.S. Lewis was an amazing writer. I hate to say this because I really wanted to like this movie but I was somewhat disappointed. I have to very much agree with zach-74's review of the movie. I don't expect books to translate directly into movies. They are different mediums. But I thought this was a mediocre attempt. Without re-hashing zach-74's review which I think is right on, there were a couple missing elements that I wished they had put in. Where is the playfulness of Aslan? His playing with the children and also with the animals that he brings back to life gives him a wonderful quality that we don't get in the movie. Another element was the suffering that takes place on the walk to the Stone Table when Aslan is to be killed. Maybe this was getting to close to the underlying Christian element in the book (It is NOT an allegory; those who say it is need to look up the definition of allegory. It has strong Christian overtones but Aslan is not an allegory for Christ...Christ practiced nonviolence, something Aslan does not). At the end, I didn't feel that Aslan was really the amazing, wise, compassionate character that he is in the book. I also missed the humorous asides and narration that are present in the book. I don't know how that could be accomplished in a movie but I think it could have been attempted. There are other movies that have narrators.As for the characters, I though the children were reasonably good but I was most disappointed in Liam Neeson as Aslan and Tilda Swinton as Jadis. I tried to be impressed by their performances but I was left lukewarm. Neeson didn't have quite the inflection that I would imagine for Aslan. I wanted to feel that I was hearing Aslan and instead I just felt like I was hearing Liam Neeson. Swinton looked good in the previews but in the movie she seemed...small...that's the best word I can think of. Jadis is supposed to be this extraordinarily tall, originally dark haired, magnetic figure. Instead she is just creepy and cruel...there's nothing that makes me understand why Edmund is so entranced with her. Those who have read the Magician's nephew know that there is a fascination with her...she exudes some quality that leads you to be enchanted with her until you discover the cruelty and hardness underneath the surface. One more thing...for those who have not read the book, that whole bit at the end with them grown up is probably a bit confusing. I feel like movies should be able to stand alone...meaning a person doesn't have to read the book to understand what's going on in the movie. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to say this movie was perfect, I found myself often having to turn to my memories of the book to fill in the blanks in the movie that didn't quite fulfill it's potential.","

"Stampsfightclub","18 June 2008","In their first major career roles, Georgie Henley (Lucy) Skandar Keynes (Edmund) William Moseley (Peter) and Anna Popplewell (Susan) star in this C.S Lewis adaptation about their characters finding a magical world in the back of a wardrobe.Having never read the book but heard rave reviews, I was intrigued to see this film and wasn't to be disappointed.In a magical fairytale for the whole family, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe has something for everybody, the mystical adventure for the younger generations, and a few good characters and experienced ideologies for adults.A question mark hovers over the acting but with first performances it is understandable.Tilda Swinton (Michael Clayton) is excellent as the witch, her cold personality and the character epitomizes the true essence of evil, which is what the story follows.Good vs evil is often very obvious, which is the case here with the golden spirit of Aslan and the cold white heart of the witch, giving the film good balance.The writing and mystery behind Narnia is very good. The sheer imagination of a wardrobe containing a magical kingdom is a good enough reason to go and see the film and is well established by Andrew Adamson. Though not the best direction, it gets the required effect.I'm not a huge lover of CGI being a person for realism in context and etc. There is no question that the work that has gone into creating all the creatures and scenery is outstanding. But I'm personally not a fan of it, but if you do like it, then this is CGI at its peak.Apart from a few lapses in the story and pretty bad acting, it is an enjoyable fun film for the whole family.","

From the score to the soothing sound of Aslan's voice, this film is calming and peaceful. The acting is surprisingly good, the character development is at the forefront (especially for Edmund) and the setting is gorgeous. There is a lot to love about this movie.With a great message of redemption and sacrifice at its core, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe is a film that I watch when I want to feel something.Note: First act Edmund is the worst!2nd Note: The White Witch is still absolutely terrifying.","

"dilbertsuperman","18 December 2005","The original CS lewis books listed great battles but Disney serves us up a very watered down and bloodless version of the CS Lewis epic tale. This is most watchable film interpretation to date but it doesn't follow the book properly. I was disappointed with the battle scenes and the unimaginative swordplay that always ""killed"" without ever drawing blood. LAME.For little kids who are ignorant of the original books this movie is a fine outing for them. For adults who haven't read the books it will be OK. And for those of us who are literate in CS Lewis we will always hold the books far above this fart of a movie. This rendition of the tale makes simply makes the books even that much more inviting.THE BATTLE SCENES: Some of them were duplicates of footage from the video game Age of Mythology, along with the characters(Minotaurs to name just one) and their armor styles. I think someone saved a few dollars by re-hashing some footage??","

"MelyssaRave","7 January 2006","I wasn't expecting the movie to open up with as much excitement as it did. The bombers destroying England were spectacularly done. Within the first 5 minutes the characterization of Edward starts. We see him risk his life and Peter's life as they run back into the house to get a picture. The first time Lucy set foot in Narnia was breathtaking. James MacAvoy was a great Mr Tummus. In my opinion the best casting decision was to cast Tilda Swinton as Jadis. For someone who grew up on the books I was able to see things my younger sister couldn't - like the ties between Lion and Nephew like what wood made the wardrobe and how the lamp post got in Narnia. My favorite part was at the end. When Lucy tried to get back to Narnia after all her adventures and the Professor said ""You can't get back that way. Believe me, I've tried."" (Or something along the lines of that). That one line left them so much room to do the prequel.","

"ocseagull","9 December 2005","I just got back from seeing the midnight showing of Narnia. It's been quite awhile since I have read the book, but from what I recall, the movie stayed very true to the novel.The CGI effects were outstanding and the scenery was breathtaking. The audience was comprised of younger teens and adults and there were quite a few laughs and some outright sobbing at various points throughout the movie.The human actors were quite good in their roles and dramatic without being over the top. The storyline was easy to follow and no one in the audience left during the film for popcorn or a bathroom break, all eyes were focused on the screen.Possible Spoiler***There are a few scary scenes that parents of younger children might wish to be aware of - when Peter faces a wolf, the sacrifice of Aslan, and some of the scenes in the battle to name a few.There has been a lot of talk about the religious undercurrent of the film. If you are looking for it, you will find it, but it is not ""in your face"" obvious. The film can simply be enjoyed as fantasy by anyone of any or no religious persuasion.","

I'm not totally positive what held me back, but it may have been the sense that even with great CGI (check), some strong performances (check), and faithfulness to the book (check) this would be hard to get totally right. I was mostly right about that. That said, we watched right after re-reading this book with my youngest, and I can say that it mostly worked. It is not LOTR (or anywhere close), but that's not a fair standard - especially for a children's book. The middle sagged, and the embellishments were unnecessary...but it was worth watching.","

"SenorSpeilbergo","11 December 2005","Okay; to start off I grew up with ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" as a child, and was fascinated by the books and the few made-for-TV adaptation of it. But as I grew up, I completely forgot about them, and how good they were.So I went and saw the movie tonight on a whim. I wasn't expecting anything great. The trailers made the film look like an over-bloated HP/LOTR knockoff. But what a surprise!!! This film brought back fond memories of my youth. It was nice to see that they didn't butcher the story and dumb the film down (although I think there were a few more action scenes in the film then there were in the book. Haven't read the book in a while, so I can't say for sure).But what a faithful retailing, and a GREAT film in general. Everything about the film was just fascinating and beautifully captured on film! I can't see how anyone could dislike this movie (unless there the Grinch). And in my opinion; Narnia puts LOTR and HP to shame (oops. Maybe I shouldn't of said that? Lots of hate-mail.)So yeah; there you have it: 10/10. Bravo to Andrew Adamson and his team.P.S. What's with all this ""Religious Propaganda"" sh*t I see everywhere on these boards? I didn't even know that the Chronicles had anything to do with Religion in anyway shape or form, I just always found the story fascinating and well told. It's a great movie regardless of how you look at it.","

"jrepenning","14 December 2005","You really need a tally-sheet to review this movie; so many Great Expectations!Truth to the original story: really close, 9 out of 10.Let's start with: they did the right story first! The fad, lately, of numbering the books in historical order (starting with ""The Magician's Nephew"") is just inexplicable, must be due to someone who hasn't actually ready them. The stories don't even make sense in that order! That the movie crew began where Lewis did is a very great credit to them.There were two things missing, though, that are actually quite important to the book: Edmund's inner dialog, and the rather parental voice of the narrator (""how silly it is to close yourself into a wardrobe"", ""that's the problem with magical food""). These really are missed; without them, the tale takes on a very different character, and perhaps even point.There were three things added as well: a long preamble showing what Lewis' oh-so-brief ""because of the bombing"" really means, a substantial Peter-Jackson reference in the battle scene, and an Exciting Adventure Involving a Waterfall. These are a mixed bag: I think by now, over fifty years after WWII, most folks alive need a bit of explanation as to what ""the bombing"" really meant, and the work here is really, really good. The spectacular battle scene, though, does not so clearly carry its weight: as an attraction for the SFX fans, it's pretty lack-luster; as a fixture in the myth, it's a bit distracting from the important points (though they're all still there). And the bit with the waterfall ... what was that all about? Revolution in the writing squad? ""We must put in one original idea of our own""?Quality of the Effects: by modern standards, pretty mediocre, 5 of 10. But then again, even what is here begins to distract from the story as it is: it's not really an SFX vehicle, despite the talking animals.Acting: there's a lot of debate about this, and I'm torn. Part of the debate though, I think, is from folks who haven't read all the books, and don't know how these children will age: some of what seems uncomfortable here is supposed to!Character development: not too much, 4 of 10. Then again, that's the way of it with the books, too; some Narnians show more character development than the Pevensies.Tagging up on all the key ideas, images, plot points, metaphors, characters, and other details: really, really good, 10 of 10 (except as noted above). But it did seem, occasionally, to be doing just that: ""ok, now we have to have THIS happen, because it's in the book.""","

Not to mention the battle scenes where they opted for computer-game quality graphics... and the dead aslan - could they have made it look more like a stuffed toy?Combine that with a truly awful score, and a shear lack of creative imagination from the director. It just wasn't a patch on the BBC adaptation I watched as a kid (maybe its just better over ten episodes on a Sunday afternoon?). Or maybe I'm just fifteen years older?It was all made better, however, by the lines: ""Whoa, Horsey"" ""My name's Philip.""Which frankly, is one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time.","

"thewandering1","6 January 2006","For me it was fun and worth the money spent. Having just read all 7 books again (since I hadn't read them in at least 20 years) I was looking forward to this movie with some trepidation. After all Hollywood doesn't do well on book or comic to movie conversions ever.It was fun, a little slow going at certain points, but fun all told and my fiancé who had never read the books only had a few questions (which if they would have been more faithful to the books they wouldn't have been).**SPOILERS**** The gratuitous bombing scene of England I personally didn't feel like it added anything to the movie (took away from the beginning quite a bit for me SLOW). The fact that they changed the why of how they all got into the wardrobe (cricket ball versus visitors/guests to the professors estate) worked better in my opinion as more believable for a reason to get kids to hide (and close the door) to the wardrobe. The fact that the professor hinted at the end of the movie that he knew where they had been was kind of a cheap way of saying that if this movie doesn't make enough in the theater's at least now we don't have to explain the entire 7 book series or make them (that's at least how I read into that). The kids actually don't find out until much later in the series about the professor and his involvement with Narnia.I do agree with other posters that the magic of how the IceQueen got Edmond to follow her lead was lost and in so doing they wrecked his character a little and made it unbelievable that he could 'change sides'. Candy that was addictive and that would never allow you to be full no matter what you ate is a lot easier to swallow then what they did in the movie. I also agree that in cutting the frolicking that aslan did with the kids after he came back to life as well as the scene where they awoke the giant in the IceQueen's castle cut quite a bit of the magic of Narnia out of the movie. Jadia was described in the book as a 'giant' with enormous strength and this actress (forgot her name but other posters have posted it) didn't pull off the character in that regard, but did portray her cold ruthlessness rather well.Maybe they were hoping that the simple fact that there were speaking animals would assuage the magic feeling for kids and there was no need to include on the simple character building that the books do. I hope they do better with Prince Caspian.","

"Geeky Randy","4 January 2008","In an era where fantasy books can be satisfyingly transferred into film, it was to be expected that the C.S. Lewis's classic ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" would be brought to life too. And it was. But without justice.""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and the ""Harry Potter"" heptalogy were as successful as possible. ""Narnia"", on the other hand, didn't seemed to put forth as much effort as the others. The technology used in the film didn't create the same magic as the other fantasy-stories did. As the film progressed, it became abundantly clear that ""Narnia"" was nothing more than a competition to ""Lord"" and ""Harry"" (with an obviously smaller budget).Many people impressed with the film can argue that it was entertaining and enjoyable. This is all fine and dandy. However, it is mere fact that the film's creators didn't go about the project with the love and passion for the story like those of ""Lord"" and ""Harry"". The campy special effects, the underdeveloped characters, and the fact that the ""Narnia"" film-series is going to be abridged by four book leads to the conclusion that this is done for nothing more than profit.For those who are bored and looking for something to do, you may enjoy this lazy excuse for a film. But for those who want to be impressed as they were with ""Lord"" and/or ""Harry"", wish to see a wonderful classic brought to life on screen, or just like seeing special-effects, you will be greatly disappointed.","

"Jay_Exiomo","8 January 2006","I admit I have never read a single ""Narnia"" novel (although I've read a few chapters of C.S. Lewis' ""Mere Christianity""), but I did get excited about ""The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe"" getting its cinematic treatment considering the great awe I had for the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, of whom the author of the novel it was based on - J.R.R. Tolkien - was a good friend of Lewis.The first part of what could be a new installment in the fantasy genre tells the story of four Pevensie children - Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy - who are brought far away from London to an old country house to escape the perils of World War II. During a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy stumbles upon a seemingly ordinary wardrobe in an otherwise empty room. She hides inside only to realize she is transported to the perpetually snowing land of Narnia, a land where animals talk and the evil White Witch rules causing the winter spell.Soon, all four of them get to enter the land and they learn of Narnia's history: the great lion Aslan is the true guardian of the kingdom and has been absent for many years but is ""on the move again."" It is also prophesied that when four children are to take the throne, the witch's powers will fail.As I've said, I've never read the book and was not sure what to expect when I came to watch the movie, other than it was set in Narnia, that there was a lion, there was a witch, and there was a wardrobe. And from the plot summaries at the back of so many versions of the book, I also knew there were four children. But after watching it I'm now thinking of catching up on what I missed on my reading list during my childhood years. ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" presents a variety of messages, both within the Christian context (which should be obvious) and the world in general.I don't know how much liberty was done with the book but I like the direction director and co-writer Andrew Adamson and screenwriters Ann Peacock, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely took the audience on. Adamson has accomplished to retell a story that includes talking lions, beavers, foxes, fauns, centaurs and other fantastical creatures which could have been otherwise ineffective, and maybe even unintentionally funny. His experience with Donkey and Puss in Boots may have helped.Adamson succeeds in all this while the script provides it with humor. It is also filled with impressive visuals, peppered with good soundtrack. The film also boasts of first-rate CGI but unlike ""King Kong,"" where CGI was used in an over-indulging fashion, Adamson uses it to perfection. Through all this, he works with a cast of mostly first-time actors, especially the children. The performance in particular by Georgie Henley as Lucy, is sweet but never cloying. Tilda Swinton as the White Witch provides menace to her character.I think it has enough charm and enough depth to stand quite well on it's own. I guess it depends on how the viewer will react to the thematic story beloved by many (unread by me) in this Disney interpretation. Perhaps a lot of people will be inclined to dismiss it, partly because the religious theme may turn them off, partly because they hate Disney, and partly because fantasy is just not their thing.While I would not say this movie is better than other fantasy films of the contemporary era, it certainly does bring a positive outlook for what's to come to the series or even to the whole genre. ""Lord of the Rings"" has attained such great heights and even the ""Harry Potter"" has elevated itself so much that, personally, this first installment of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" finds itself a little wanting. Still, it is well-made, and that says a lot for a first installment... that is, if it IS the first installment.","

"ps_wife_ktdibi4","29 December 2005","Excellent, excellent, excellent. Worth seeing again and again. This is one of those movies that is worth investing in so that the movie industry will continue to make movies like it. It contains exceptional moral values, faith, love and hope. It has action and great special effects. It explores the imagination and beautiful fantasy lands. Kids and adults alike that have an appetite for worthwhile entertainment will definitely enjoy it. The movie, based on the book by brilliant author C.S. Lewis, follows the details in the novel exactly. It is such a moving book and now film. The four children, facing such a hard time in their lives, are summoned upon to fulfill an intriguing prophecy and the movie depicts their journey, both physical, spiritual, and moral.The child actors all display outstanding young talent. The voices of the characters are captivating. Everything about this movie was just done in an exceptional manner. A+ and bravo on this one.","

"the-evil-cult","22 January 2006","We watched The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. How was it? Let's just say that the first half was good. I liked the mood created by the music, which was really nice and consisted of smooth woodwind noises.But then the movie just got bad. I really didn't like some of the messages of the film. I didn't like it how the professor says that it is ""logical"" to trust in your family. What if your dad sexually abuses you?. Genetic relatedness means nothing. The kindest person in the world may be someone with completely different genes to you and the most evil person in the world may be your brother, sister, or father. Saying, ""Trust in your father. He knows what is good,"" may sound nice, but what if you were giving this advice to Adolf Hitler's hypothetical children? The way Edmond all of a sudden changes I thought was weird. Still it all seemed unrealistic. The worst part about the movie would be the battle scene. It's the same old thing we've seen in The Phantom Menace, Lord of the Rings, Troy, Alexandra, and maybe more movies. When some concept is popular, the media executives really milk it, don't they? Whether it's martial arts wire-fu or reality TV, surely people must get sick of the same thing over and over again. I was yawning throughout the whole battle scene. We've seen it all before. Some other people are saying this movie was more incoherent and sanitized, and yes I suppose these are fair concerns.I should also add that Georgie Henley, the girl who played Lucy, was strangely realistic in her acting. She was also a very likable character.","

"didi-5","11 December 2005","17 years after the first attempt to translate The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe into a live action film comes this big screen treat from Andrew Adamson, previously best known for Shrek.CS Lewis' book deals with four children, evacuated during WWII to the home of Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent), who find a magical world inside a wardrobe in a stately home. This new world is populated by mythical creatures (fauns, centaurs, satyrs, and dwarfs) and talking animals, and is ruled by Aslan, a Christ-like figure in the person of a talking lion.Narnia is in the grip of the White Witch, the self-styled Queen Jadis (played by Tilda Swinton). Curiously if all 7 books are to be filmed the story of how Jadis came to be in Narnia has been missed out (this is told in book 1, The Magician's Nephew, although The Lion... was written first). It is always winter and never Christmas, and there is a mysterious prophecy that states that the White Witch will lose her power when two boys and two girls sit on the thrones of Cair Pavarel.Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the quartet who find themselves placed to fulfil this prophecy. As such they have to carry the film, and are not bad in doing so. Little Georgie Henley as Lucy and William Moseley as Peter are very good indeed; Anna Popplewell as Susan and Skander Keynes as Edmund less so - but watching four children could easily tire the patience of an adult viewer and they were pleasing enough to watch.CGI is employed to produce the battle sequences and the talking animals. Aslan, voiced by Liam Neeson, is an impressive creation, but others - the beavers and the fox - are obviously fake. None of the other animals or creatures (save the centaurs) are sufficiently magical in the way characters in the Lord of the Rings series were; although the film more or less keeps to the story Lewis wrote, and James McAvoy puts in an appearance as an impressive Mr Tumnus.The screenplay does contain some howlers ('Gee up horsey' 'My name is Philip') but is basically very good. The soundtrack is largely modern, save an Andrews Sisters number early on (just to remind us we are in wartime no doubt). Thankfully someone resisted the temptation to follow the lead of the stage show which turned the book into a musical! What Adamson does well is to show us how the children develop to their new lives in a strange land. They meet the demands of battle and learn to cope with new friends and new dangers - the police are vicious wolves, Father Christmas stops to give them weapons of war, the Wicked Witch turns her enemies into statues; and there is the ritual sacrifice on the Table of Stone.A promising start then. I look forward to seeing other instalments in the series and hope this film is a success.","

"kooleshwar","26 April 2006","When I rented this movie I had already heard so much about the movie and was skeptical as I generally don't end up enjoying movies with to much hype.Also I had missed the movie in the theaters and was really excited when i got this DVD almost the next day after it released.This movie will be one of the rare movies where you expect the world and end up getting it. Everything about the movie is great and save for a one or 2 I cannot see any flaws in it.The acting is excellent and I'm not to sure whether the plastic expressions of Edmund were intentional or because he is a bad actor but the fit perfectly with the mood he should have been throughout the film.The setting of the film is in fantasy and even though some scenes reek of LOTR and New Zealand the fantasy world of Narnia has been masterfully created.A special winner is the background score of the film which was brilliant and was further enhanced with some great mixing on the home-theater enhanced sound on the DVD.The old fashioned values that are taught in this film (sacrifice, family bonding, hope) are endearing to people of all ages and are far better than the stupid cartoons that are being dished out today(spongebob , squarepants ).The only thing that annoyed me was the quality of the action towards the end of the film which could have been much better considering the pg-13 certificate (i can never understand why they freak out in fight scenes when whats really disturbs the children are the sexual themes in movies even with pg-13, i mean we watched cartoons where people fought and killed every time and were no homicidal maniacs).Save for that this film is a perfect family potboiler with loads of hope, scary scenes, funny scenes , inspiring scenes etc etc etc.A must watch for all ages and a far better film for children then say a Harry Potter.You have to watch this film.","

"amcdermott","28 December 2005","I loved this movie from the first scene to the very last frame! It was such a true, loving, serious recreation of the wonderful book with THE MOST AMAZING VISUAL EFFECTS I HAVE EVER SEEN!!! Aslan the Lion is quite possible the most amazing visual effect I have ever seen (although I have not seen Kong yet) but he was so realistic and emotive, I completely believed he was a living, breathing, feeling being. Not to mention that the overall look of the film is gorgeous and the action and peril is so well done! The kids do a great job for the most part, especially the youngest girl, who steals the show. There is something in this movie for everyone. Go see this movie! You will be entertained and amazed no matter how old/young you are!","

"Iron_Zorro","9 December 2005","When I walked into the theater, I was afraid they wouldn't follow the book at all. But as I watched it, I saw that they followed it page by page. I definitely suggest reading the book first though. There was actually one time where I yelled ""Yes!"". After Aslan roared after being brought back to life, it was great. The sets were beautiful, the actors were above average, and the only changes from the book were improvements. You think the kids are gonna be just some wooden child actor, but they were so believable. The animals were very realistic and the entire movie was just fantastic. I recommend this movie to everyone. Go see it now.","

"ketchupartist","9 December 2005","So, I've never read the books. I tried to read them when I was young, but it couldn't hold my short attention span. But I was totally pulled into the film and the good part of not knowing the books was that I wasn't at all disappointed. In fact, it was so good it made me actually want to pick up the book and try again...something I haven't ever really considered doing. After it was over I was tempted to sneak into another theater where it was playing and watch it again. I can't wait to take my family to see it. The battle sequence was cool...but the parts I liked the best were the personal moments between characters. I enjoyed the fact that I didn't know very many of the cast members; it was refreshing to see new talent on the screen. It helped me to be more into the characters. By the way, what is it with fantasy movies always being filmed in New Zealand? I know that this one was filmed in a lot of places, but mostly, it seemed in New Zealand. Weird.","

"georgioskarpouzas","28 December 2008","It is true that my relationship with the Narnia universe is rather haphazard since I have read half the book on which this movie is based, i have watched Prince Caspian and afterwards I saw this movie which was judged correctly as a suitable one for Christmas.This movie along with Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter have done the most to popularize elements of the mythology of Northern European peoples as well as public school British culture than anything else. One could argue that they are powerful tools of creating a certain image of the western middle ages in the popular mind.But of course these ideological aspects should not bar someone from enjoying the sheer artistry of the movie both on account of the acting as well as the special effects and costumes. It was a feast for the eye for those that enjoy watching wonderful and terrible creatures.Sometimes the Christian overtones of the book were said to be underplayed, at least this is what I had read in critiques in magazines.It was a choice of the company for commercial reasons. As far as I was concerned at least in the case of the resurrection they could never have been more obvious:the presentation of the altar and the fact that women learn the happy news first.The device of talking animals goes back to Aesop as well as Lafontaine for those with more westernized sensibilities and it was aptly used in this movie.The schoolchildren destined to fulfill a prophecy is the main convergence with Harry Potter, the magical pseudo-medieval universe with Lord of the Rings.Both boys and girls radiate charm and intelligence, as well as the trio of schoolchildren in Harry Potter movies and I confess that as a foreigner I developed a certain feeling of inferiority towards Anglo-Saxon schoolchildren. The Hobbits of Tolkien are I think rather more humble in demeanor therefore perhaps acquiring a vaster possible audience as role models.The evil witch is typically a fairy tale personage, even more so when she appears good to further her purposes. I recommend this movie especially for Christmas time.","

"fearfulofspiders","8 September 2008","Face it, after the immense success of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Harry Potter films, it was bound to happen one day when a studio was going to unleash a big-budget adaptation of C.S. Lewis's novels of The Chronicles of Narnia. While not nearly coming close to the epic scale or emotional level that The Lord of the Rings gave its audiences, it is far more magical than the Harry Potter films, and needless to say it is more faithful to the source material than any of Potter's strongest installments. It is a nicely done fantasy for younger kids.While beautifully shot, to call this an epic is too much credit. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is quite slow in pace, and the scale of the film is too small. It's great for kids, but slightly flawed.The acting is well done. Everyone is great in their roles, and Tilda Swinton plays the witch so well, we hate her like a living person. It's a lovely cast, that all fit in their roles well.The special effects are about as good as the work done in The Prisoner of Azkaban. It's okay, though there's points when a little fine-tuning could've resulted in a better execution. The battle at the end of the movie has soaring points, yet the ogres, centaurs, wolves and polar bears all seem lackluster.Harry Gregson-Williams' score is very disappointing. The guy didn't even do his homework when composing this very drowse-inducing music, not listening to what the music sounded like for The Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, and as a result, it sounds nearly the same if the two were combined. Very unoriginal, and the sheer lack of intelligence in the composer has made him one that I will try hard to avoid in the years to come.The pacing of the film, as aforementioned, is slightly dull. The only rousing moments are the wolves chasing the kids on the icy river, and the final battle between the Narnians and the White Witch's army. The action is nicely choreographed, however, I highly doubt that kids of that age are capable of killing or fighting in battles. Very unrealistic, even for a fantasy. What would've made it more believable, would be if the screenplay writers incorporated some sort of motive, or something endearing that could be lost as a consequence to failure, I mean, even if it's Narnia, the kid's only real connection to anyone are the Beavers and Mr. Tumnus... who I'm sure they could live without in the long run. The lack of screen time and character development allows for fast relationships with Aslan and many of the characters, it's just not likely to fight for someone you've only known for two days. Horton Hears a Who has a stronger message and executed better.All in all, The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is definitely one of the better films of 2005, after a lackluster summer. I recommend it to kids 12 and under, as older ones will find more interest in The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter films.","

"jessesweetemail","19 October 2006","When I first sat down to watch this movie, I admit, I was expecting to see another clichéd movie about good VS. evil, everyone is happy in the end, but I got much more than that.It starts with The Blitz from the World War II that took place in the 1940's, it took many people by surprise, but I thought it was very good because it gave us look at each of the children. I found myself in tears when the four children (Lucy, Edmund, Susan and Peter) say goodbye to their mother so they can be evacuated to the country for safety reasons, the story unfolds from there.As the story grows as does the children. Lucy (Georgie Henley) goes from a small scared child to somewhat of a little valiant. Edmund (Skandar Keynes) goes from a bitter and resentful child into a wise and caring young man. Peter (William Moseley) turns into a mature leader and Susan (Anna Popplewell) realizes that sometimes things are beyond her logic, the four children are played splendidly by their counterparts and I eagerly await to see them in Prince Caspian where I think they will be even better.The special effects in the film was spectacular and very nicely done, I enjoyed watching the numerous different animals clash in the battle (the most exciting part of the film) and it was good to see the two brothers finally banding together to bet the cold.Also Liam Nesson brilliantly voices the regal and wonderful lion Aslan, the true leader of Narnia who has returned to help the four children save the day. The Stone Table in which Aslan sacrifices himself in Edmund's place was a very emotional part of the movie and many people (including myself) were crying.Tilda Swinton was amazing as the White Witch and you shuddered in fright every time she raised her voice or merely gave that steely glare, her and Skandar Keynes went wonderfully together and it was a joy to see them go from 'friends' to foes. Also James McAvoy was wonderful as Mr. Tumnus, the kind Faun who Lucy befriends on her first adventure into Narnia, it's a pity neither will be in the sequel.10/10","

"Soysoy","15 October 2006","« Welcome to Duloch, such a perfect place » : sugarcoated, soulless, lifeless, artificial, phony, kitsch and without imagination. Interesting irony: the director of ""Shrek"" doing this. I guess he felt he needed to apologize from too much subversive thinking.The huge success of this so-called « movie » tells a lot about our society and the way people want to « dream » nowadays. It's frightening. It's been a long time since I have attended something so lifeless, watered-down, sugary, tame, devoid of any genuine emotion, entirely virtual and fabricated. In comparison, the blockbusters that it tries to emulate (the LOTR and Harry Potter movies) look like timeless masterpieces, and this is coming from someone who'd rather eat a cactus than attend a LOTR movie ever again, as bombast and overkill tend to make me feel nauseous. As for the HP movies, I only celebrated the third one as a « real » movie, thanks to the extremely talented Alfonso Cuaron. To each his own, for my part I'm still in love with Scott's « Legend » (the export version, with Goldsmith's score, not the awful USA cut / Tangerine dream one) as nothing has ever come close to it in terms of painting a fantasy/magical world on the screen. Yes, it's mushy, but it works. Scott was a genius, at this time, at pulling off coherent, alive, breathing, working cinematic worlds (Alien, Blade Runner, Legend).Here, everything you look at is artless and lifeless, just petty/pretty, sugarcoated pinch-beck images, a « 3-D Barbie fantasy show » as a friend of mine called this, CGI prowess presented as great achievements while being just pseudo-realistic digital dolls on a stage (it kinda looks like the real thing until you try to smell it and discover it has no smell whatsoever, or any taste for that matter) while all sense of depth, substance, emotion, soul, magic, is meticulously wiped off. The whole thing looks like a phony plastic Xmas tree. Pretty to look at, but anyone used to a real tree can only be very disappointed, and feel sad that the magic is gone.As usual, Tilda is absolutely jaw-dropping. A Queen she is indeed, not only in the story but in the movie team as well. Looks like she was the only artistically competent (grown-up) person in this team. Why such a fantastic actress isn't hired for A-works (artistically speaking) is beyond me.If you like real fantasy, look somewhere else. If you insist on having some family sugar-coated evening, even the Sound of Music and Mary Poppins are leagues ahead this soulless digital fest. Watch these again instead. Want the real thing ? (Re) discover Legend, the fully restored director's cut.","

I remember having a big crush on the White Witch, beautifully and masterfully played by the marvellous Tilda Swinton. She played Jadis so well, she had me rooting for her even after the sorrowful Stone Table scene which had me in way too many tears as a child. I rewatched it today for the first time in years and I was almost moved to tears as my memories of fascination and awe came flooding back and seeing every word C. S. lewis wrote come to life before my eyes after reading the book as an adult. The movie left me in enchantment as a child and still leaves me in a magical trance as an adult! The adaptation is just as good as the book, if not better and if I could rewatch it for the first time, a million times! I would! I vividly remember when my father would hide Turkish delight in our wardrobe and come out of it pretending he just came back from Narnia and I'd always go in and look for it but disappointingly failed to find it every time. Even now as a 20 something year old, I still check every wardrobe I see, hoping to find that lamp post and the magical world beyond it.","

First of all, the acting: Lucy is charming and adorable, love her; Edmund was cold enough, very good; Susan was bossy in the right time, great; Peter was heroic and a father when he need it to be, so they act very well; The W.witch ( Tilda ) was evil all the time, the best; Mr Tumnus was magical, perfect and the voices of Aslan ( Lian Nesson ), Maugrin, Mr Beaver and Mrs Beaver simply incredible. The direction: A superb job, you have the felling that you entered the wardrobe with the kids, thats make the direction amazing. The effects, make up: No words, I really cant imagine something that this guys couldn't do. Aslan, Mr Tumnus and the Eagles were my favorites. Favorite scene: The Stone Table, touching, emotional and powerful. The Score: it works perfect with the film, movie theme is powerful and the chorus behind, wow!!!

"fabulousrice","5 May 2006","Here's yet another awful set of (badly) moving images from Diss-ney.Actors: they don't act. It's shocking how little dramatic direction they got, how flat and emotionless their acting is. Main reason that will make you forget the film 10 minutes after you're out: they just can't act. The kids weren't even cast to look alike (they're supposed to be siblings!). Tilda Swinton, very fine actress most of the time, shouts and acts with grandioso gestures as if she thinks she's in a Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter scale epic... which it isn't. Director: he doesn't direct either. You'd think there would be interesting camera angles, intelligent editing, mysterious travelings into the forest? No. The cinematography is awful, brightness always makes everything so obvious and plain that all sense of mystery disappears instantly, the sets are almost over-lit sometimes. The camera surely remained locked on its tripod during the whole shoot. It does move a tiny bit during a sleigh chase sequence, only sequence in which something really happens (""happen"" might not be the word), and it instantly qualifies as the worst chase sequence in the history of cinema. The action is reduced to some running scared, never gets any better. Even the ""war"" scene (yes, I know, there aren't supposed to be ""war scenes"" in films for kids... don't ask me) is disgustingly still and heavily-directed. Wardrobe design: absolutely horribly disgusting design, the ugliest and stupidest designs for clothes I've seen in long. Whenever the actors wore a different outfit, I could barely restrain myself from laughing because it was even stupider than the previous one. Hence the Witch with her ""ice"" hat, hilarious it's so ugly.Computer graphics: the worst I've ever seen. The beavers look like two obese humans, the fox looks like anything BUT a fox, and the LION... oh my, the lion is the worst piece of computer graphics I have ever seen in my life. Anything animatronic would have looked more realistic than this, a man in a lion suit would look more realistic than what they did here, hell, they should even have used a real lion, but this lion is absolutely rotten computer graphics, and makes Godzilla look like a masterpiece of realism and good taste. But you know, nowadays, everything HAS to be computer graphics, n'est-ce pas? Even if it's the phoniest visuals ever seen, they're still going to do it and not question themselves a single second. The plot: I haven't read the books, I have no interest in religion, Christianity or paganism, and yet when in a kid's film Santa Claus shows up distributing magic whistles, swords, potions and what not, I really can't help wondering why I paid to be watching a film with such stupid ideas. Or maybe the film's target is kids who are yet to be taught that consumerism and bigotry are not the only two ways to see the world. It doesn't go anywhere. The Witch can freeze people, but Aslan can make them live again. You can be wounded, but the magic juice heals your wound instantly. The lion dies, yet the magic stone table gives him his life back. It's not going a-ny-where. Production design: as cheap and uninventive as the rest of the visuals. The snow looks fake, every supposedly ""cold"" area depicted in the film is blatantly shot on a sound-stage (they don't even try to add some steam, mist, or anything, when someone talks in the middle of the snow-filled forest, the girls don't sneeze while all they're wearing is stockings and a skirt, etc). Nothing in the atmosphere of the film remotely compares to such fantasy masterpieces as ""Legend"" (dwarves & unicorns) or ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" (little girl lost far from home in fantasy world), which were made long before computer graphics and with a lot less money. But with plenty ideas. Make up effects: bad bad bad bad bad. Once again, totally uninventive, very very cheap-looking, ugly to look at. Just plain ugly. Cohesion: a lion with no lips saying the word ""past"". Kids living during World War II who need to fight on horses and with swords to defeat a Witch surrounded by cyclops (why don't they just go out of the closet and go get a good old tommy gun somewhere to get rid of the filthy stinky one-legged scum?). There is NO cohesion. But maybe that's from the books themselves.To sum up, I'd just say ""phoney"". Phoney acting, phoney snow, phoney computer graphics, phoney animals, phoney everything, this is the state of the art of phoney. Even if it was made-for-TV, or straight to video, it would be a phoney TV movie. When the film was over and the atrocious song started to play (awful song, really), I hadn't felt like I went on a trip anywhere, I just felt like I was stuck at the bottom of a closet for two hours, talk about escaping! Some people say that the film has a Christian content. The only message I could ""read"" through the film was that ""inside the closet"" was better than ""out"". I'd love to know if it's a Christian message as well?It is very important that I say that the gratuitous violence, the various occurrences of plain hatred, resent, graphic violence or bodily harm and purposeless humiliation or torture towards friendly characters of the story make this film highly unsuitable for kids under 15 or 16. Disney and the rating associations probably had to work hand-in-hand to get a PG, but the kids that cried and sobbed in the theater when I went and saw the film, I'm sure they didn't hear that.","

"byrann_gowan","19 November 2011","I will start off by saying that, while this is a very good movie, I do think that the next two are unfairly criticized for not following the source material as this one did. Now, I haven't seen ""Dawn Treader"" yet, but I should remind people that ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" is, in my opinion, the most famous Narnia tale of all the Narnia movies. For this reason, I think that the people behind the scenes had a bit more freedom with the second and third movies, while this one, they had to have it really close to the book in order for it to work the way it did. Don't get me wrong; it is good to follow the books. I'm just saying that ""Prince Caspian"" and ""Dawn Treader"" are not as famous as TLTWATW.Now, onto this movie.I'm really surprised that this only got a 6.9. This deserves a way higher rating. I won't go into too much details about the story, but for those who don't know, it's basically about 4 children who end up stumbling into a magical land via wardrobe, and find out about a prophecy that includes them in a huge way.I can't emphasize how much I love this movie. I'm 18 years old, and as a Christian person, I instantly fell in love with this back when it came out in theatres. I wasn't worried about whether or not it would follow the book, and I'm glad I wasn't worried. This film delivers.You could say that the special effects are amazing, but what really steals the show are the performances. Let's start out with the stars of the film: the four Pevensies. William Mosely definitely is the weakest, and is really the only reason why I gave it a 9 out of 10, but he is good. Anna Popplewell has that motherly look that you feel when she is on screen, which makes her perfect for Susan. Skandar Keynes is great as the mean little brat known as Edmund, who learns a ""little"" lesson as the film goes on. But, Georgie Henley is the star that shines the most. It is through her character that we see Narnia first, and when she's on screen, she gives the child-like energy to her performance that is needed for the character of Lucy.Now, it's not all new faces here. The first movie star that we see is James McAvoy as the faun Tumnus, and he gives off a performance that will make children love Mr. Tumnus just as much as he seems to love them (as seen in his interaction with Lucy). Tilda Swinton gets the most screen time out of the heavyweights here, and she is chilling (no pun intended) in her performance as the White Witch. Fans of the Shrek series will recognize Rupert Everett's (aka Prince Charming) voice as the fox who appears throughout the movie. But, the most recognizable actor here is the voice of Liam Neeson as Aslan. I could listen to that man read a telephone book with that voice. He is among Morgan Freeman and James Earl Jones as to having a soothing voice, and he proves it with his performance of Aslan.Overall, this is a film that should not be missed; it will please you whether you are old or young. The special effects are completely first class, the story is gripping and stays true to the book, and the actors all do their jobs well. A 9/10 for me.","

"baker-9","18 January 2006","Despite some fine scenes and special effects here and there, ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" doesn't quite scale the heights of film fantasy to which it aspires. There's a kind of dramatic flatness to the story, at least as adapted here.Granted, the original isn't particularly complex emotionally even compared to Lord of the Rings. Director Andrew Adamson has only directed the animated ""Shrek"" films before this, so that could also be a reason for the one-dimensional quality of the drama.Also, the acting is very uneven. Among the children, the wonderful Georgie Henley as Lucy and Skandar Keynes as Edmund are fine, but Anna Popplewell is a dull Susan, and William Moseley is a stiff Peter whose transformation into a soldier is impossible to take seriously on any level. Tilda Swinton has a imperious coldness as the White Witch - I liked her though you could say that she isn't quite terrifying enough. Another highlight is James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus - his scenes with Lucy are among the best in the film.The final battle scene - not explicitly described in the novel - is Lord of the Rings Lite, but it works well enough. One disappointment is the voice of Liam Neeson as the lion Aslan. Obviously it was recorded separately, but Neeson's line readings aren't very engaging and the sound has a disembodied quality that exposes the artificiality of the special effects. Some of the other voice performers (Ray Winstone and Dawn French as the beavers, and Rupert Everett as the fox) fare better. This film gets its job done well enough, but classic fantasy film it isn't.It'll be interesting to see when/if the rest of the Narnia books get adapted. Unlike ""Lord of the Rings"" or the more recent ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy, the remaining Narnia books are extremely variable in quality (and increasingly preachy), the final volume being downright dull.","

"yeyahbenji","22 December 2005","When I had first heard that ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" would be hitting theaters, I practically shouted with glee. It had been about seven or eight years since I had read all the books, and the upcoming film persuaded me that now was a good time to revisit the land of Narnia, which I encourage all to do (it takes a steady-paced reader only three to five hours to finish the book).I had anticipated that the movie was going to add its own bits and pieces here and there, since the book is not so heavily detailed on the actions of its characters (the emotions and feelings, however, C.S. Lewis delves into particularly). I was correct in assuming so, but I believe the additions to the movie were very effective from the cinematic storytelling standpoint, the only scene that seemed a bit far-fetched being the melting ice river. Overall, the movie is a faithful representation of what the book is, which is what I had hoped to see upon watching it.Though apprehension comes with knowing the movie will star four child actors, the children did exceptionally well with their roles. They were not perfect by any means, but their overall performance was crafted very well. The voice acting was superb, and even though I always seemed to imagine Aslan's voice as a much deeper, booming voice, Liam Neeson delivered well and stuck on to me after a few moments.The computer generated effects were mostly outstanding. Yes, the battle scene was definitely not as glamorous as Lord of the Rings, but the size of the battle in Narnia was just right; ultimately, much of it was left to the imagination of the director and screenwriters, since C.S. Lewis covers it only briefly. What they did come up with fit well into the scheme of the film.I believe that the film is best viewed right after having read the book. Though many movies based off books have failed miserably in the past, today's slew of movies is being helped greatly with modern technology and the fantasy genre in particular (a la LOTR and Harry Potter) benefits well from it. Narnia has now reached its time for the same conclusion.","

"PeteRose","26 February 2007","I was really looking forward to this film, considering I was a big fan of the book series as well as a huge fan of the original BBC production. So after seeing ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005)"" I was more than a little disappointed.This is honestly one of the worst films I have ever seen. The acting is terrible, especially on the part of the two eldest children. I usually love Tilda Swinton, yet I was severely disappointed with her lackluster performance as the White Witch. The pacing of this film is the worst part. The entire movie is extremely rushed in order to reach a major epic battle scene that in the book was a mere afterthought. Though there are a few elements of war and violence, that is not what the story is about. While some of the computer generated effects look okay, most of them are way overdone and instead of serving the story, they overpower it. I'm not a book purist or anything, so I don't mind if a story is changed in order to fit more appropriately on screen, but I do have an issue with filmmakers creating entire sequences that do not appear in the book solely to showcase their supposedly superior computer effects especially when these sequences do nothing to advance the plot.This movie is bad. Plain and simple, it is one of the worst films I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot. Not good, not even for children.Check out the 1988 BBC production and its sequels instead. While they may lack something visually, the story is much richer and more worthwhile.","

"niara","28 December 2005","I have never read the books. I really looked forward to seeing this film. I cannot say enough how horribly disappointed I was. A talking lion. Talking beavers. More CGI than I have ever seen in any one film. And absolutely at it's core, no story whatsoever. Pretentious and sanctimonious prattle. Completely unbelievable. I would have given twenty minutes -- any twenty minutes -- from any of the LOTR films then The Chronicles of Narnia. This is clearly Disney's attempt to cash in on what began with the Harry Potter films -- their foray into epic children's stories and the cash cow that they have generated. Brought to you by the man that gave the world ""Shrek"" and ""Shrek 2"", no less, who sat in a dark theatre watching LOTR and drooling over Peter Jackson's masterpiece and thought in all his naiveté, in all his conceit, ""I can do that too.""","

To me if a movie can make a 5 yr old sit still that long it is better then expected!!! I loved this movie and now my son wants me to buy the series and read them all to him lol. He also wants to go see it again. It is a great move for children, maybe not all that young but in general. I highly recommend this movie i enjoyed it a great deal.

"xdor","10 December 2005","It doesn't cease to amaze me how Walden continues to bring down great directors.Holes, while I had never read the books, had the same stilted hollowness that they managed to infuse into the Narnia tales (and that's WITH Disney helping) and that film was directed by the same director as the Fugitive! (Around the World in 80 Days was a travesty against the original work, but it kind of worked since Jackie Chan became the main character) How does Walden do it? How do they manage to wreck such great material? Despite having Mr. Gresham on board, the writer/director/maybe even some of the actors miss the feel of the book. Maybe it's not possible to replicate that on-screen: ever. But they should have at least tried for a more serious treatment. This was way too kiddish: like it was made for the Chicken Little crowd. I was hoping for something much better, much more sobering.As far as acting goes, Georgia Henley is the best. She was the life of the movie. But as a result, everyone else (especially Susan) came off looking a little stiff. It never seems that the characters get to change much. They start off as one might expect, but by the end it doesn't seem like they're much different except for those crown things on their heads.The music was terrible. Pop-ballads done with a symphony sounds cheap. Where was the theme music?The editing was terrible: unless you're just advertising to sell an extended version of the DVD. (Hey audience: if you feel unsatisfied, buy the real movie next year!)The children should have gotten lost like they did in the book so we didn't have to waste time having Peter and Susan whining about going home the entire film (oh bother, we have to rescue Edmund first...) Very little build up to Aslan. No build up to the war. Trying to be Lord of the Rings, but Narnia isn't Middle Earth and they should never have tried to make it that way.The witch's wolves have American accents: why?The worst thing was the loss of the intangible feeling of discovery and wonder of a world within a world. I don't know how hard it would be to create it (in some respects the BBC version still had this feeling), but if you're going to spend $120 million, you sure shouldn't leave it behind.I think this comes down to bad writing and too many corporate milk-toast spines having influence. All you needed was a real screenplay (one that they apparently weren't willing to pay for since they went with the cheap just of school writer) and someone who was passionate about the story and the BE ALLOWED to tell it. With only three or four lines of dialog being from the original book, I almost doubted whether Walden had actually optioned the material from the CS Lewis Estate! Watching the film did give me hope for one thing: it may still be possible for me to remake it some day. True, I'm American and I'm overly critical, and it will be 30 years before anyone will even care to see it again: but after seeing this film: I want to try. I think that's what having British people write/direct this British work does. They can't feel the book, because the book is nearly everyday English life and they can't see how that's interesting. (Remember the book didn't do that well in England, the US is where Lewis got his child readers) But there's a whole feeling that as an American I get from the book that is essentially idealised English family life, something that many Brits can't stand anymore. There's nothing for them to do than try to update and ""modernize"" it away: but when, as an American, that's a large part of what I enjoyed.Solution: have an American write and direct the movie, and don't let a single American have a voice on screen!","

"r_bex4eva","28 September 2008","Perhaps when I went into the cinema to watch this movie I had set my expectations too high. After all, the book has been my favourite thing to read since i was about nine and I was nineteen when the movie came out. However just because i was older does not mean i love the book any less; i can read it whenever i have a minute because the story is just so gripping. Sadly this did not transfer over to the movie.Firstly i have to say that the casting of the children was a terrible one. Not a single one of them could act and the compassion i feel for their book counterparts was lost on them. They all seemed very wooden and unable to put any feeling into what they were doing.I also felt that they start of the movie seemed very long. Too much time seemed to be spent setting the scene in this world rather than focusing time on the events of Narnia. There was also a lack of focus on Edmund and the enchanted food Jadis gave him. I can't recall anyone mentioning the potency of the magic in the food, making Edmund seem even more of a brat than he is in the book (and I'm an Edmund fan). Jadis herself seemed like a total wash out, unable of striking any kind of fear into anyone making Edmunds scene in the battle when he broke her wand losing its importance.Another scene that annoyed me as I am such a fan of the book was when the characters are fleeing from the beaver's house and Maugrim is seen chasing them and eventually trapping them on the ice. When the heck does that happen? One of the things I always liked about the book when they are fleeing from the secret police is that the reader never knows how close behind they are. The wolves aren't seen but you get the feeling that they're close. Instead we have a really lousy scene of Peter making a prat of himself (which he just seemed to do a lot in the movie) Saying all that, the visuals were very good. Seeing Aslan and the beavers made for very interesting watching and are perhaps the only high points of the film. That and the costumes and scenery. It was hard to stomach when Liam Neeson did such a good job providing Aslan with a voice, and was then cast along a group of children whose whiny voices and forced acting made me want to leave the cinema and come back when the animals were on.If you've not seen it, don't bother. I would recommend reading the book as it explains far more in a much more pleasant way or watch Prince Caspian, because despite the children still being shocking actors, that movie isn't half bad.","

"djansen24","1 July 2013","The 2005 version of this classic children's novel is a very competently made film. It for the most part seamlessly blends special effects, CGI, and live action together. The acting is competent. It follows the book with few exceptions. Why only a 5 star rating? It takes itself way too seriously. C.S. lewis' novels were so enchanting because it was all about tone first with story a close second. In the film, while the plot is followed, the charm was lost. The characters were stiff and serious. I did not feel the excitement of children exploring a new world. I did not feel reverence and awe in the presence of Aslan. What I remember mostly from the film was the last battle which was extended and shown in great detail. In the book, the battle is given only a couple of paragraphs. But since this is Hollywood, they felt the need to extend it and ramp up the violence. In many ways, I felt I was watching an action film for adults marketed to children. The only scenes that came close to enchantment were with the beavers. But that didn't help the serious tone of the film to lighten up. This is one of those films where less would have been more, slower have been more exciting, and character more entrancing than action. What surprised me the most was how the fabulous Tilda Swinton came off so unconvincing as the White Witch! I still have yet to see that character portrayed convincingly. Basic advice, if you want a ""good looking"" film with action and special effects, then you will like this film version of the novel. But if you are willing to forgo the superficial pleasures and enjoy the tone of the novel (the most distinguishing aspect of the Lewis' book), then check out the 1988 BBC television version. It production value is very crude by today's standards, but it captures the magic of the book better and lets the story unfold naturally.","

Sadly it feels like the story in ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" has no room to breathe. The characters although many and very imaginative, they don't have the opportunity to shine. We get only a glimpse of who they must be. Even the sibling protagonists are underdeveloped and there's practically no chemistry among them. I get this story is full of allegories and allegoric imagery and full of imagination and beauty but sadly only some stuff gets to come across. It sadly doesn't translate perfectly from the paper to the big screen.","

"Buddy-51","17 May 2006","During the height of the London blitz, four young children are sent off to an estate in the countryside to wait out the war in safety. Ironically, they soon find themselves caught up in a quite different war, one that takes place in a world not their own. For while staying at the house of an eccentric professor, the youngsters discover a magic wardrobe that leads them to a mystical land of centaurs, fauns and a whole host of anthropomorphic creatures - a snow-covered land called Narnia. The kingdom is ruled over by a wicked witch who declared herself queen after she usurped the throne from a benevolent lion king named Aslan, who is amassing a rebel army to help him reclaim it. The children become a part of this epic battle since it has been prophesied that four young humans will arrive some day to bring about the liberation of this benighted kingdom.Based, of course, on the beloved C. S. Lewis novel of the same name, ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" does pretty well in its setting-up stage as the youngest of the four discovers the strange land inside the wardrobe and tries to convince the others of its existence, but once the children become firmly entrenched in the Narnian action, the movie begins to feel too much like a warmed-over ""Lord of the Rings"" with a lot less action and far less interesting characters. Aslan, in particular, is so drippy and sappy, so full of bromides and platitudes, that we have a hard time getting misty-eyed even when he's heading up the stairs to perform his act of ultimate sacrifice. Speaking of which, the Christian allegory at this point is so heavy-handed and obvious that it ceases to function as allegory and just becomes slavish imitation. And the scene with Santa Claus passing out weaponry and ammunition to barely pubescent children - how is that an acceptable image in a movie meant for youngsters? The film has a beautiful look and design, although some of the special effects shots look surprisingly amateurish and unconvincing for a film of this size and budget. The acting by the children is passable at best, although Georgie Henley, as the youngest child, and James McAvoy as the faun, Mr. Tumnus, do establish something of a rapport in their scenes together. Tilda Swinton as the Big Bad Witch does little but harrumph around the countryside, glaring and snarling.I realize that both the book and the movie have legions of devoted followers and any attack on either is bound to elicit cries of ""sacrilege"" and ""blasphemy"" from the faithful. But, the truth be told, ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is a pretty mediocre movie, pleasant to look at but boring to sit through.","

"dgl1199","22 August 2006","Classic literature and CGI technology don't always mix. They did an admirable job of it but at the same time it became a distraction. C.S Lewis had developed such rich characters replete with conflict and emotional frailty. The actors, particularly Peter and Edmund, were horrendous. I thought their performances were so wooden and two dimensional I thought maybe they were CGI. Peter was too wimpy, Edmund failed to broadcast the internal complexity of his Judas nature, the girls I thought, were fantastic. I didn't hate the movie, but I did not get the veneration surrounding it either. It could have been much more were it not for, yet again, the focus on computer generated spectacle winning out over simply telling the story. I wouldn't say don't see it, but keep your expectations in check.","

Even though it's not as good as the book (which has always remained a classic in children's literature), I consider this film to be The Lord of the Rings for kids and like the Lord of the Rings, it was filmed in New Zealand as well and some aspects reminded me of the Lord of the Rings trilogy like the effects or the action scenes or the fact that it all took place in a fantasy world. I enjoyed all the actors that played the Pevensie children and I loved Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan. I'm very glad that I read the book before I saw the film. I also enjoyed the two other sequels. But I think the Narnia movie trilogy is kind of underrated. While it's nowhere near as good The Lord of the Rings trilogy, they deserve more credit.","

Of course there are some slight omissions and additions, but it stays true to the book for the most part. Rupert Everett's fox character was my favorite addition. I do love Liam Neeson as Aslan but personally, I think he could have made Aslan stronger and less subdued. Tilda Swinton is fabulous and believable as the White Witch. She is beautiful and yet does a terrific job of invoking fear as well. The children were wonderfully casted but Susan's character could have been a bit less whiny. Father Christmas was perfectly portrayed. I cried, I laughed and wanted to see more. Remember to stay in the theater to watch the credits! Hopefully, there will be more movies in this series to come and I do hope they win some Oscars. A perfect holiday movie to bring your children to!","

I am sure this great achievement couldn't have happened much sooner as the quality of the special effects needed to do the story justice simply didn't exist until recently.The movie was well worth the wait. I was captivated from minute one and was so excited to see some of the scenes that I actually found tears in my eyes. Reliving the story, watching the characters, meeting the creatures, it was all like coming home.The casting was great and was done by someone who obviously had read the books and knew the characters as well as serious fans know them. Tilda Swinton was fabulous as the White Witch and made the transition from the nice ""queen"" who ""snowed"" Edmund to the terrifying war waging witch perfectly. The children played their roles flawlessly, going from scared war ""orphans"" to mature royals saving their kingdom. I was amazed to see them at their coronation, seeming so grown up and seeming so wise.The special effects were just amazing. The variety of creatures in the book were shown in such a real manner. I particularly enjoyed the method used to portray the tree spirits. None of the mythical beings were unbelievable and Aslan was simply magnificent, although I pictured him a bit larger. I did not pick up on Aslan's voice being Liam Neeson's, I merely knew the voice was familiar and his was a perfect voice for Aslan.The battle scenes and some of the ""dark"" creatures may be too intense for younger children but this is a children's movie based on a children's story. However, most adults should find it enjoyable. It may be helpful for adults to be familiar with the series to really appreciate the movie. I recommend this movie for everyone with an open mind to fantasy and the age-old, good winning out over evil tale.P.S. Do not leave the theater when the credits start rolling.","

"orourkec-292-269155","27 December 2014","I watched this Narnia movie and even though it isn't a very good film and is kinda simple-minded overall, I enjoyed watching it nevertheless. I think that it is a movie that moviegoers of any age can enjoy, even if not in a 'very' sense. I was pleased with the film because I thought it was well paced, well filmed and that storytelling was crazy fun. Not only that but other pleasing things as well are the movie's humor, the comical touch to it, the innocent wonder and the main characters' play on words. The voice of Liam Neeson as the lion Aslan is compelling and worth a WAOUW exclamation. The voice fits the lion character perfectly. Lucy and Edmund are also compelling children characters and extremely believable. I even liked the evil White Witch whom I thought was a fabulous villain - just by her looks and calm presence you can instantly feel uneasy and feel hatred too. Well done on that, really. Oh, and last but not least is the direct visual imagery switch which I found really good and groundbreaking. Now, I'm going to say something else which I think the movie should have improved upon: I think that the wonderfully CGI designed Aslan lacks an outside character feel, which means that he should have been made into a character from or for (do you say for or from for that sentence?) whom you can feel respect and/or fear in all of his scenes in a powerfully irresistible way. That I think would have made him a better character. My rating: 7.0/10","

"smittysgirl16","10 December 2005","As a fan of C.S. Lewis' books, I thought that this movie did ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" justice better than any other medium in the past. Even though I was a little skeptical at first, all of my fears were extinguished when I saw the final product.Since this was such a good movie, I don't want to leave people with the few very minor gripes that I had, so I'm just going to put the bad points at the beginning to get them out of my system. One was that they put a little more emphasis on the children's importance than Aslan's. In the books, spring and Christmas return because Aslan comes back, but according to the movie's Father Christmas, the children were breaking the witch's spell. True, the children are important in the book, but they were tacked with extra importance in the movie. It' obvious from Beaver leaving out the prophecy about Aslan that he talks about in the book. Another of my gripes is that they don't seem to be paying much mind to ""The Magician's Nephew"" when it came to the Professor. In that book, which is supposed to come before LWW, the much younger version of the Professor goes into Narnia using magic rings, not the wardrobe. I got the impression from the very end that he actually went through the wardrobe to get to Narnia. The wardrobe was in fact made from a tree that grew out of a Narnian apple seed in Young Professor's backyard long after he got back from his last trip there. There was never any indication that he even knew the wardrobe led to Narnia until Lucy entered. However, there is a nod to ""The Magician's Nephew"" when we looking at the lamppost. In that book, a lamppost on a busy street in our world that has two little bars sticking out of the near-top gets grabbed by a carriage driver. One of the bars breaks off when the driver gets accidentally taken to Narnia. The bar is then thrown to the ground and makes a full lamppost grow in its place, hence the end marking of the land. The fact that the lamppost of the movie only had one bar was a nice touch. These points in the movie were definitely not enough to quell my enjoyment of it at all, but I still felt that I needed to get them out there.Let me now state some of the many good points of this movie. First off, the animation was superb. I found it very hard to believe that Aslan was completely computer generated. His mane and his features were so real that I almost doubted the fact that he was a fake animal. The animation of the other creatures was top-notch as well, including the beavers, the wolves, the fox, and pretty much everything else. This is animation that might surpass the ""Lord of the Rings"" and another Disney creation called ""Dinosaur"" in terms of quality. The scenery was also amazing, so much so that it took my breath away.The acting of the children was top-notch, especially that of the little girl who played Lucy. She captured so much emotion and practically stole the show in every scene. I was also very impressed with the actress who played the White Witch. She did a perfect job of playing an ""actor"". The fact that she could do the fake compassionate and then move on to pure evil was amazing to me. That takes a lot of talent. I very much enjoyed Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan. He was perfect for this part and really helped sell Aslan for me. I actually think it's funny that everyone on screen who's old, wise, and British is played by Liam Neeson nowadays. I don't think that there's anything wrong with that, but I just think that it's funny.The pure heart of the movie was what had me the most. The relationship between the brothers and sisters was great and very touching. The death of Aslan was worthy to be called the climax of the movie with such heart wrenching sadness as well as pure happiness taking over when he resurrected. That actually brings me to the issue of the Christian allegories. I'm not going to list them specifically since they are very obvious in the movie, but I for one am very happy that Disney didn't water them down. They were my favorite part of the books and they are my favorite part of the movie, too. I'm glad that Disney got smart and realized that the parallels in the story were not offensive in any way, but rather essential to the overall plot.I actually cannot think of any more great points to this movie because the movie as a whole was so fantastic. If I had to list all of the good points I could think of, then I would have to write a ten-page paper, which I don't think that anyone has time to read.All in all, I say that this was one of the best movies of the year. After horrible and pointless movies like ""Your, Mine, and Ours"" and ""Aeon Flux"", as well as the good but very adult movies like ""Walk the Line"" out on the screens, this was the breath of fresh air I needed to get geared up for the holiday season. A very good family-friendly movie is hard to find these days and I'm glad that Disney is delivering at long last. I certainly hope that the Oscars recognize the superb animation, beautiful screenplay, and possibly even the picture as a whole (wishful thinking because of the allegories and target audience, but you never know) in its voting. This movie is Disney at its best and I recommend it to anyone, Christian or not, who loves adventure, action, and amazing film-making.","

"hajejan","12 December 2005","Every now and again you come across a film that is so beautiful that you just don't want it to end. Even in a fully-seated cinema, you forget that you are there with people. The screen swallows you, the story engulfs you, and the whole film's sole purpose seems to be to tell you, and only you, a story.I recently had one of those experiences when following the Pevensie siblings on their journey through Narnia, in the form of the 2005 release of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. There is no doubt in my mind: taking on the magic of C.S. Lewis is beyond the mental capabilities of most directors. When it was announced that the director of the Witch and the Wardrobe had not made any ""real"" feature-length films before, I dreaded the results deeply. How would the maker of Shrek and Shrek 2 translate his skills into transmogrifying one of my favourite childhood memories? I should not have feared. The Chronicles of Narnia is a film that couldn't have been made 10 years ago - it relies so heavily on special effects and digital tricks that even attempting to make it without all the digital trickery would have resulted in a B-movie, regardless of its budget. With his experience as the special effects guy on several of the Batman films, Director and producer Andrew Adamson did manage to put together one hell of a display.With all the visual do-goodery in place, and one of the best stories ever told to drive it forward, there wasn't a lot to make the Witch and the Wardrobe fail... And of course, it didn't. Striding from strength to strength, effortlessly combining the magical with the mythical, the impossible with the improbable, and the beautiful with the gorgeous, this was 2 hours that couldn't possibly have been filled with more heartwarming surprises. I'm not the kind of person who cries often, and especially not on films, yet this film had my eyes welling over half a dozen times - that's how beautiful it is.After I came out of the cinema, I ended up texting an old friend of mine. Her response summarised the film and how I feel about it better than anything else could have: ""There's always a Narnia somewhere"".","

"WilsonLau","16 December 2005","Yeah i just came out of the theater after watching this one and i had to get on here to warn people. Unless you're 10 years old or younger, avoid this movie and save your money. This movie can be best described as a made for TV movie with a bigger budget. Or perhaps it could be seen as a watered down kid's version of Lord of the Rings.The first 3/4 of the movie was a total yawn. Character development is non existent as we are not given any insight about the personalities of the children at all, all we know is that they're children running away from the Nazis. Furthermore, what we do realize about these children are that they are quite the little runts. With exception to the the youngest child, Lucy, the rest are a bunch of malcontent, annoying, complaining, unworthy rodents. Edmond in particular is an obvious pain and i would not be misty eyed at all to see this little brat's existence come to thankful end. The older sister is annoying as well and there are several times during the movie where she was so annoying that you wished you could reach into the movie screen to ring her neck. I was not made to feel any sympathy for these two. The oldest boy, Peter was a bit easier to tolerate however still not worth a care. How could the viewer enjoy this movie if they didn't care for the main character's well beings? A very good question...The story is seriously flawed and also share painful parallels to the triumphant Lord of the Rings movies. For example the death of their leader, who later is resurrected by questionable, and head scratching means. The big battle that seemed to be lost, suddenly saved by a last minute addition of troops. A character that does not wish to take their role as leader but afterwards taking up his sword and marching into battle... Please give me some credit... please give viewers credit... we are not morons, don't treat us like we are.The inhabitants in Narnia also do no make much sense as they do not seem to be able to follow footprints. The White Witch (aka female Saruman) is all powerful, able to freeze anyone with a motion of her staff however fails to be able to dispose of a child who just picked up a sword 2 days ago for the first time. She forgets about all her powers and tries to swat him with swords. Which brings me to another point... how could children who were given weapons by Santa Claus and have had not previous training be able to battle in a war, be better able to lead an army into battle better then any soldier already in the army? Overall this movie was a real disappointment and falls short on many many levels.4 out of 10","

"crowrobot","10 December 2005","The long-awaited film version of C.S. Lewis's 'The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' has arrived, and I'm largely impressed. The material has become more nuanced and compelling in it's transition from book to film, the action is very good, and Narnia is perfectly realized. The film, while enormously entertaining, is not perfect.One of the main problems with the film is the spotty direction of the child actors. Georgie Henley is magnificent as Lucy, and Skandar Keynes brings some depth to Edmund (watch his face harden when he tells the others, ""I've seen what the Witch can do.""). Peter (William Moseley) and Susan (Anna Popplewell), alas, do not fare as well; they are stiff, awkward, and wooden compared to their siblings. Fortunately, this is only a minor problem.What I'm really impressed by are the inhabitants of Narnia. Aslan (voiced terrifically by Liam Neeson) looks great, as do the Beavers, the Fox (Rupert Everett), and the assorted animals and fantasy creature. But especially the Beavers. They add greatly to the enjoyment of the film, and Ray Winstone and Dawn French are clearly having fun as the voices. Tilda Swinton is awesome as the White Witch, and she relishes getting a chance to play a figure of pure evil.Director Andrew Adamson (both the 'Shrek' films) handles all this material nicely, even if the kids get a little annoying once in a while. 'Narnia' is no 'Lord of the Rings' or 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'; it's clearly intended for family audiences. This doesn't hurt the film, though, and it's a highly enjoyable fantasy adventure.","

"barnabyrudge","12 December 2005","The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe had already been filmed twice prior to this 2005 version, once as a rather mediocre cartoon in 1979 and once as a modest-budget BBC mini-series in 1988. It had never been done on a grand cinematic scale though, possibly because of the phenomenal expense and technology needed to bring it to life in a manner true to the essence of C.S Lewis' book. The catalyst for this latest attempt to tell the story was probably Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy. Having seen in Jackson's films what could be done - what monsters could be put on screen, how epic battles could be realised, how fantastical worlds could be visualised, and so forth - the folks at Disney decided that the time was right to have another go at this Narnia favourite, only this time they've thrown a mega amount of money at it, as well as every type of visual trickery under the sun. The result is certainly a stirring and well-made piece of entertainment, and easily the strongest adaptation of the story thusfar.During WWII, four children are evacuated from bombed-out London to an old mansion in the countryside. They are Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgia Hanley). The mansion belongs to an old professor, and the children are warned by his crusty maid that they must behave perfectly whilst in the house. Pretty soon boredom sets in, and the children decide to play hid-and-seek to pass the time. Young Lucy chooses to hide in a wardrobe, but she gets quite a surprise when she finds that the wardrobe is actually a magical entrance to a fantasy kingdom called Narnia. One by one, all the children find their way into Narnia via the wardrobe, and they discover it to be a kingdom locked in a permanent state of winter by the evil magic of a powerful witch (Tilda Swinton). The witch has long ruled over Narnia, turning all who oppose her to stone. However, she has always feared the words of an age-old prophecy that states her reign of terror will come to an end with the arrival of four humans in her kingdom. Afraid that the children are the four humans of the prophecy, the witch deceitfully lures one of them - Edmund - onto her side and tries to turn him against the others. Meanwhile, Peter, Susan and Lucy travel across Narnia, evading the witch's wolves every step of the way, and eventually meet the mythical lion Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson) who prepares them for the final battle against the witch and her monstrous army.At 2.5 hours, The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe is a well-rounded and well-developed film, though perhaps a bit too long for very young audiences. The special effects work is pretty impressive on the whole, with a convincing gallery of beasts and some magical sets that really capture the child-like wonder of Lewis' stories. Some of the CGI effects in the battle scenes are a little obvious and detract slightly from the spectacle. The performances are good on the whole, particularly the four young actors and Swinton as the despicable witch, plus James McAvoy as the faun Mr Tumnus. One thing, however, that I found really unconvincing was the way that novice swordsmen like Peter and Edmund managed to cope so well on the battlefield.... surely the witch's army would have despatched with the pair of them quite comfortably if they'd fought so inexpertly?? It is an enchanting tale which has stood the test of time, and thankfully the scripters have stuck to the story faithfully in most aspects. On the whole, The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe is a good, solid family film and a long overdue effort to do a version that is worthy of the source novel.","

"bensampup","18 June 2006","I must admit when I first heard they were making The Chronicles Of Narnia the first thought that came to mind was ""great another movie that will follow none of the book!"" but I was surprised at how very wrong I was.When I walked into the air conditioned cinema, I was expecting it to start of with a snowy beginning but was pleasantly surprised when it started out anything but that, I was actually quite frightened.Everyone gives a 100% performance of my favourite child hood heroes. Little Georgie Henley shining through as the sweet and innocent Lucy Pevensie, Skandar Keynes perfecting Edmund Pevensie, the most difficult character to play out of the four children. Anna Popplewell and William Moseley, were born for the roles of Susan and Peter, the two eldest children. James McAvoy was the perfect choice for Mr. Tumnus, getting the double agenda perfectly and was there anyone else who could play the evil villain like Tilda Swinton did? Andrew Adamson did a truly marvellous job and I salute everyone who worked on this magical and beautiful film! 10/10","

""It is a Masterpiece"" It is certainly a movie I will buy when the DVD is released. If your looking for a edge of your seat movie with a good cast of characters this is the one to watch. If your smart you will even catch the meanings intended by the author C.S. Lewis. I read the entire series as a teenager and enjoyed it very much.

I was waiting for a big let down, but it was close enough for me. I personally would have loved to see the giant get the handkerchief from Lucy, or Mr. and Mrs. Beaver put on their snow boots. But I also loved some of the extra scenes.. like when the children are in London. I feel bad for some of the people who didn't read the book though, they really are missing out. And like always the book is better then the movie, but this movie was pretty good. :)","

The battles also felt hollow and rushed. I also felt that the story was americanised and toned down for a Disney audience. You didn't get a true feel for Narnia at all in this movie, nor did it build the characters enough. It seems to me to be one of the biggest wasted opportunities in movie making possible. It was hard to believe that someone could ruin such a good book. I really wish Peter Jackson had made this movie. So much was missing in this movie - The movie really felt like a cheap Lord of the Rings wannabe. If you are at all interested in Narnia, please read the book and don't waste your money watching this rubbish.","

"joybro","25 December 2005","I saw this movie as an animated children's program about 20 years ago, so I knew the storyline pretty well. This version was brilliantly done, and the special effects really brought the original story to life. The acting was top draw, and the casting of Tilda Swinton as the White Witch was spot on, It was if the character was made for her. Filmed in New Zealand with spectacular scenery this movie was a real visual pleasure. Ray Winston and Dawn French were brilliant as the voices for Mr and Mrs Beaver, with Winstones cockney charm a delight for cinema goers. James Macavoy was splendid as the faun Mr Tumnus he really captured the essence of the character. And Liam Neeson was the perfect choice as the voice for Aslan. The children were all very good and convincing in the parts they played. Especially little Lucy who was a real little cu-tie and perfect for the part. THE LION WITCH AND THE WARDROBE Is a Children's classic and this movie does it credit, an excellent movie I would recommend to everybody who enjoyed their childhood.","

Narnia is so fantastic it will make you want to see it again and again. -I thought that the movie was marvelous. There were a few surprising moments in the movie. For some people the movie was sad for some it was happy. For me it was in-between. I thought that when Lucy first found the wardrobe and they didn't believe her it was sad. But when Aslan came and made Peter a knight of Narnia it was very happy moment. -It's joyful, heart warming and completely brilliant. The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion, The witch, and The Wardrobe was a hit. The movie everyone wants to see and I am sure you do too. Why? Because this movie is worth it. It was unbelievable to watch. I even read the book and you can find out that the book was just as good as watching the movie because they are both great. However, the book may be more educational. So the movie and the book were a success and we are lucky to have C.S.Lewis that wrote the book. In the movie there were many fantasy and reality things. There ere fauns and beavers that could speak, but I am not going to tell you everything so now it is up to you to read the book and watch the movie, to see and imagine the Chronicles of Narnia. -Have you been looking for a phenomenal movie to watch lately? Well, you're just going to have to watch the chronicles of Narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe. This is an eye catching movie with varieties of different outstanding events. If you're a person that likes fantasy this is your type of movie. Don t hesitate just go and have a merriment time. Enjoy!!! -140 minutes of passion, excitement, and sadness. It made me grieve in some parts of the movie. It also thrilled me in parts, my heart pumped with light making me want to weep of happiness. It was just like a machine, the machine's purpose was to emotion change. Tears of sorrow swept down my face while watching the death of a whole slew! A ferocious lion goes at it with a witch. No ordinary spell casting witch, a fierce, selfish, hideous, wicked, and a hex witch. So you can sit back watch the movie and try not to soak your face with tears. Also you might be surprised where the tricky cliff can take you.-The door was opened through the two worlds Narnia and our world, but at what consequence to the pevency family. Four children enter Narnia while hiding in the wardrobe from the house keeper that gives tours of the Professor's house. They enter Narnia as a family and leave as legendary HEROES! While in Narnia they defeat the evil witch that rules Narnia and get dubbed King and Queens! This adventure has so many thrilling parts it be impossible to put them all on one page. Out of ten I give this movie nine! NO movie will top this one for months and months.-On Friday December9 2005 Kameyosek school grade 5/6 class went to go see the movie, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, at Cineplex Odeon theatres in South Edmonton Common. My grade 5/6 class went to see the movie because we read the book and studied a lot about The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe. I thought the movie and the book were both excellent. The movie really pulled me in and wanted me to watch more and more. My favorite part of the movie was the big battle when everybody fought and the scariest part was when Edmund found the Witch and he stepped over Maugrim. I stood up and made a loud noise and every body in the theatres screamed. The saddest part was probably when Aslan died. I did not know what was going to happen. I was felling very depressed when Aslan was killed. I was thrilled at the end of the movie. When Edmund did not go with the witch. Instead Edmund stayed with his family. When Edmund snapped the witches wand that was probably the most heroic thing Edmund ever did in the movie and the novel. The lion, the witch, and the wardrobe movie and novel were very entertaining. I would give it a 9 out of 10 rating. And I would recommend it to everybody who likes action and adventurous movies. The lion, the witch and the wardrobe was very exciting so go see it or go read it.","

"Aureias","3 January 2006","I went to see this movie expecting something relatively decent, something on the scale of LOTR's epic as some people have been making the comparison to. However, it was disappointing besides the visual eye candy.Human characters particularly weak besides Swinton, I was rooting for the white witch the entire time. The kids themselves are irritating, lame, and whiny, besides maybe the smallest of the four. They're relatively one dimensional.There's several points in the story in which believability is thrown out the window, given that it is a ""children's fantasy,"" in which I'll allow some sort of leeway, but there HAS to be some sort of rational sequence of events that leads up to the acquiring a certain skill or a turn of events.Strategy and stupidity of the armies is enormous, I refuse to believe that a white witch who has ruled over the world for the past 100 years is that bad of a tactician.All in all, the CG animals, such as the talking beavers are the redeeming aspect the adaptation.Probably entertaining for someone not as critical or for little kids.","

"TashC","19 June 2006","While the dark recesses of many wardrobes are a mystery containing untold treasures and/or horrors, there is a particular wardrobe in a spare room that leads to the magical land of Narnia. A land where the White Witch (evil) has reigned for 100 years, but Aslan the Lion (good) is on the move. This is such a vast and beautiful world that an epic clash between good and evil is inevitable.Set during World War II, the four Pevensie children are sent away from blitz-bombed London to the safety of Professor Kirke's country mansion. Peter and Susan are the elder children and stoically sensible and responsible. The youngest child, Lucy, is sunny and engaging. It is Edmund, desperately missing his father and smarting against the assumed authority of his older siblings, who has some hard lessons to learn about temptation and treachery.Isolated and bored in the sprawling house, the children resort to playing hide and seek. Lucy hides in a wardrobe and stumbles into Narnia, a land frozen in the grip of winter and the evil Witch. This seemingly random event begins the fulfillment of a prophecy of biblical proportions. And the biblical themes that run through these Chronicles are undeniable.The essence of Narnia is Deep Magic. Mythical creatures such as unicorns and griffins, mermaids and centaurs and even Santa Claus mingle with more modest birds, beavers, badgers and wolves. All these animals can talk and even the trees are listening. So who can be trusted? Definitely not the White Witch, with her guilty gifts of Turkish Delight. She is the epitome of evil, breathtakingly icy and chillingly ruthless. As for her followers, fortunately it does seem to be true that evil disfigures and deforms as they are the foulest collection of genetic mishaps we have ever seen.On the other hand, Aslan the Lion is molten gold goodness, with a lion's courage and a true heart. His voice resonates with warmth and it can only be summer in his presence. His followers are a host of the most dazzling beings in Narnia, as well as a myriad of sharp-witted forest animals.The Chronicles of Narnia incorporate CGI at its most seamless. Though for all the awesome scale, its beauty is in the details. Only four of the heroes are human and it is set in a vast, magical land, but this fantasy is warmly familiar. Following his first meeting with Lucy, Mr Tumnus the Faun says that she ""made me feel warmer than I've felt in 100 years"". This is how we felt about our first trip to Narnia and we can't wait to return.","

I had no concept of the life outside the theater for those two hours. But this movie was definitely over-hyped.

"Tinuvielas","25 November 2005","A short advance review  I saw the film last night and I won't bother with a summary here: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is disappointing from the moment the child-actors enter Narnia, and it becomes outright bad after Father Christmas passes by on his sledge. Unlike The Lord of the Rings'""Middle-Earth, this fantasy-land never quite comes across as real. The reasons for this are four: 1.) The Special Effects are very mixed: some work, others don't. While the wolves are impressive and Aslan seems hyper-realistic, if somewhat like a giant talking toy-animal, many of the other creatures are lifeless or rather, soulless. Worse, the wintry landscapes recreated on sound-stages are plainly artificial, and the matte paintings in some scenes are simply awful, as is the breaking ice on the CGI-river. Then there's the lack of attention to detail. Why on earth do Mr. Tumnus' ears never move? They seem like nothing so much as fur-covered rubber-attachments, which in fact they are. (Otherwise Mr. Tumnus, played by James McAvoy is one of the film's few highlights.) 2.) More importantly, the child actors are obviously out of their depths when it comes to acting in front of a blue-screen. A lot of ""The Lord of the Rings"" works because the actors convincingly interact with each other as well as with the fantastic environment . In this film, that doesn't happen. The children are also hopelessly foundering when asked to portray the admittedly difficult process of turning into kings and queens. It's not enough to dress them up with some live action role playing costumes and hand them a sword for them to have them overcome their apparent awkwardness when faced with their roles.3.) Some of the above may be due to the fact that director Andrew Adamson doesn't have much experience with live action movies, but comes from a Special Effects background. One example: When Edmund  incidentally the only child whose acting was impressive (but then, unlike the others, he had some character-development to portray)  stumbles into Narnia and falls backwards into the snow, he doesn't even bother to shake off the wet stuff that must have entered his clothes at the neckline. Anyone ever went skiing and fell? Or got hit by a snowball? See what I mean? 4.) Then of course some of the problems lie with Lewis'book. An amalgamate of fairy-creatures from all the myths in the world that don't really have any important dramatic justification just isn't to everybody's taste (it certainly wasn't to Tolkien's, a fact which caused their friendship to cool considerably). While such a miscellaneous fairy-world may work in print, i.e. in children's minds, it certainly is difficult to portray on screen without going heavy on the cliché-side.Thus the tag of a Lord of the Rings""-for-kids used to describe this film is misleading. It marks perhaps the aspirations of the filmmakers, but not the final product, rather underlining once more the unique achievement of Peter Jackson (whose LotR-films, I haste to say, I didn't wholly like either; see my reviews). It also draws attention to some obvious parallels: The monsters, the final battle, the way Jadis walks up to and fights Edmund  this last very reminiscent of Lurtz fighting Boromir, who was also a traitor, and Aragorn, who was also a king.The one thing I liked about this movie was Jadis as the Evil White Witch, played superbly by Tilda Swanson. I also thought that the costume-designers/make up artists did a nice job when they endowed her with a neat black and white imagery that underlined the black-and-white-opposition of good and evil that Lewis' plot is based on: The evil witch is white as ice, but her eyes never light up. The Faun opposing her is dark and rugged, but his eyes shine.Thus in the end, with Jadis, Edmund and Mr. Tumnus respectively standing out, if not redeeming this film, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is another instance of the fact well known since Dante's Hell and Milton's Paradise Lost, i.e. that it is always a lot easier to portray the absolute evil than it is to portray the absolute good.","

"yevonwm","15 December 2005","This is the worse movie I've seen in a while. I was hyped up to see it and really looking forward to it but it was just so bad i had to walk out and this is the first movie I've ever walked out on. Things that were wrong with this movie :- *Shockingly bad child actors that are precocious beyond humour *Ridiculous over-emphasis on the boring elements of the plot - everyone knows that they walk through a wardrobe, why did it take 60 minutes for them to do so? *Completely transparent special effects - you can quite blatantly see that the first horse-man was just a man with brown trousers on. *Enormous portions of the movie where there was no music and the kids were just talking crap.Where's Peter Jackson when you need him? :( I cant put into words how bad this movie is compared to what it could have been.Hats off to Tilda Swinton (White Witch) - she was up to scratch and had a go at saving this farce but it just wasn't enough. Unfortunately Liam Neeson (Aslam) just sounded like a wise nanny.Expect to be bored stiff & expect young children to cry with boredom.","

"carl-grant-2","13 December 2005","This film ruins any good memories of reading the book as a child. The acting skills are poor, especially the four children. The effects and sets are cheap and tacky ,eg - Mr Tumnus's ears! The worst thing was the ""star"" voices of the animals which do not fit at all especially the wolf, the beavers and aslan. The film is totally boring and dull and people were leaving early. On a plus point, I didn't notice any god-bothering message to the film its just a total bore, The book is so much better ,this film is so cheap looking and it is directed like a lifeless pop video. They have churned out another lifeless, by-the-numbers, charmless load of rubbish, a cure for insomnia.","

"petcrows","26 December 2005","Disney's approaching the philistine mega & evangelical churches was a disgusting marketing ploy along the same lines as the equally disgusting yet aptly bloodthirsty worshiping ""Passion of the Christ"" - it's all a sign of the times. A time when corporatism and warmongering and religion go hand in hand. A time when the worship of money and power match up quite nicely with what was wrought from 2000 years of bloody history from organized religion.But what the mega & evangelical church pastors didn't bargain for perhaps was a plot-less heartless mess of the film. Knowing how it was being used by the churches & Disney cast a wide shadow which almost prevented me from seeing it. But I did see it Christmas day. And what I found was a soulless movie. A movie which matches up with the soulless corporatist warmongering which modern conservative churches wallow in today in America. There was no plot. No feeling. The talking animals were absurd, and their talking disgraced & demeaned what our fellow animals really are - just as Disney's films did in the past.The only useful thing I got out of the film was thinking again about the whole absurd nature of the mythical Jesus's resurrection. Lewis makes a vague reference to it with when the lion sacrifices himself. But what does he sacrifice himself for? Why does he do it? Because of an arbitrary and chosen law. An adherence to ""old magic."" ""It's all poppycock,"" I thought, ""just as is what Christians claim happened with their mythical Jesus, in paying for sins passed down to us by our fathers. The concept that sons & daughters must pay for the sins of their fathers is a reprehensible concept,"" I thought some more.So perhaps the church preachers succeeded in having a message conveyed, by latching onto Disney's corporatist fascist greed in a disgusting marketing attempt to use religion to market their mess of a film - but the message conveyed is perhaps not what the preachers wanted perhaps. The synergistic marketing conveyed a message that organized religion in America today primarily worships at the feet of fascist corporatist warmongering. And the film itself, with it's vacuous & wrote nature, shows that it's little more than a self serving vehicle for the corporation known as Disney, a vehicle which the philistine evangelical churches latched on to to serve their own selfish interests.The poor person centered teachings of the mythical Jesus are far removed from these blatant but vacuous attempts to suck ever more of the uneducated & increasingly disenfranchised American workers, into an ever increasing sense of self denial & delusion - but a state of self denial which serves New American Fascism. Yes, fascism is on the march in America, and sadly Lewis's Narnia is yet another victim.For comparison, the Narnia story as conveyed on PBS a few years ago was more interesting. But I recommend not wasting your time on this latest mess. Instead, go buy the expanded DVD versions of Lord of the Rings, and maybe check out the PBS Narnia version from your local library or buy it - if you were a fan of the written version. But don't waste your time on this wannabee imitator - on this vacuous soulless sham of the film latched onto by preachers who love war, money, and corporatist power wrought through disgusting marketing synergies. Bletch. Away from me you trashy film. Away from me thou philistines.","

"dmwyllie","20 December 2017","Since I was a child I loved the magic of Narnia. What I didn't realise as a child was the sadness of war that came in both worlds. I first read the book, then the cartoon version of the movie, The TV series didn't work too well for me, but this movie does! Visually stunning, Aslan is just what I thought he should be. I wish the film producers would continue the story ... I was hoping for the Silver Chair. Let's capture a new audience to feel the magic for next Christmas :) x","

"tsheridan94","27 February 2010","As a general rule of thumb, it's best not to try to take a timeless classic novel and try to convert it to the big screen (unless you happen to be named Peter Jackson.) Last time I checked, Andrew Adamson wasn't Peter Jackson. I liked Shrek and all, but the book that, admittedly, really funny movie was based on was by no means a timeless beloved classic. While I do not believe that Narnia books are nearly as brilliant as they commonly made out to be, I still have to give C.S. Lewis credit for making books as a segue into fantasy for the children too young to read the actual classic fantasy series The Lord of the Rings. So while I do feel that Narnia books are very over-rated, I can still see their worth in introducing 4 and 5 year olds to the genre (and seriously, 4-5 is about the age level these books seem to be written for.)However, the movie adaptation takes the books' unengaging, repetitive nature, and then goes on to disregard all the values that made the books at least worth the paper they're printed on. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe adaptation attempts to be a poor man's Lord of the Ring. It keeps true to the books for the most part, but Adamson interprets what is not specifically specified in the book and tries to recreate the epic battle sequences found in both the Tolkien and the Jackson ""Rings"" trilogies. For example, in the novel version of ""The Lion, etc."" the final battle lasts somewhere around a page and a half. Along came the movie, and WHAM! 25 minute battle scene, anyone?The fact the book was made into a movie at all was also a bad decision. The book is very slow, and takes it's sweet time in causing anything to happen. With only the two Shrek movies under his belt (and stuff was continuously occurring in those. Shrek is the definition of never a dull moment) Adamson has no real experience making anything with long slow bits of dialog that seems written by George Lucas (and no, that's not a compliment.)The acting in the film wasn't horrible. It was a darned sight better than in that cinematic piece of crap called Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Now there's a film that makes a Uwe Boll movie look like manna from Heaven. Comparatively, simply because the acting was completely atrocious, this film seems about on par with one of his. I'm not saying the acting was genius or deserves any special awards. On the contrary, it was quite forgettable. But therein lies the key. Bad performances, as well as brilliant ones, can be remembered for long periods of time. I guarantee that whatever you've heard about this movie, good OR bad, the conversation probably did not revolve around William Mosely or Georgie Henley, or any of the other actors. They are not memorable in the slightest.So on the plus side, this movie didn't have me debating the merits of destroying a movie with nuclear weapons simply so future audiences don't have to sit through it and current audiences are put out of their misery. However, this came about as close as you can get to the point. Actually, Im being unfair. This movie is the perfect sleep aid. If you know any insomniacs, and Lunesta doesn't work, they may have found their perfect sleep aid. I know I did. And then, unfortunately, after the good night's sleep I was granted, I had to watch ""This film that involves something to do with a gigantic carnivorous cat, a warlock, and a big closet"" again. I did not fall asleep this team, and I was able to come to terms with how much of a cinematic turd this really is. It's just not the worst turd in existence. And that's a back-handed compliment if ever I saw one.","

"rustik1212","9 December 2005","I've waited since I was 8 years old for this book to be made into a movie. I say now, with complete conviction, this film was worth the wait! Disney did a spectacular job in retaining the integrity of the C.S. Lewis' beloved story. It is absolutely wonderful! Breathtaking photography, acting and computer imaging! You feel like you are beholding real fauns and centaurs. The actors were perfectly cast, especially little Georgia Henly as Lucy and James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus. In the end you are left wanting more and Disney appears to have left the wardrobe door open for a 2nd visit to Narnia. A dream journey, I will await once again with great anticipation. In the meantime, I will just have to go see The Chronicles of Narnia a 2nd and 3rd time. Bravo to Disney Exec's for choosing these books for film development. Everyone in our theater was clapping and whistling for a job well done. GO SEE THIS!!!","

"BronwynN","24 October 2009","My husband and I have loved C.S. Lewis' Narnia stories since we were children. Shortly after we became engaged, he took me to Wheaton College so that I could see the Wardrobe. I had to suppress my joy, but when when I got to open it, the path to Narnia was blocked.After more years than I care to admit, I finally managed to find my way to that a place more comforting than Oz or Wonderland by watching this film. I screamed at Edmund when he placed his trust in the evil Snow Queen because she made him Turkish Delight (something I've never liked, but I tolerate those who do). I was proud of Peter, Susan and Lucy as they braved things that I would have never been able to do by myself. And, then, there's Aslan. He was the giant symbol of great heart, power and love that lions are often equated with. His joy in life and the deep magic which protects everyone alive lies in every movement and that beautiful voice (Liam Neeeson). I'd seen many of the other mythic creatures before with Harry Potter, but here, even these wanting no contact with humans all became heroes fighting for what they believed in, including four children from another place and time.Lewis'series reflects the horror that England went through during World War II and the trouble it endured afterward. It's also true that they contain more than the usual amount of Christian symbolism something that some people of other religions might not care for. No matter that, because the beauty and love the movie creates can be felt by any person of every background. It is one of those things that can unify people from all over the world.When I am full of doubt that the Universe will turn out right, I pull out my copy, watch it, and my doubt starts to go away. You might like to do that, too.If you would like to read more books written by this Oxford Don, you might like _The Screwtape Letters_ and _A Grief Observed_ too.","

"annie421","10 December 2005","I LOVE this movie. I mean I love the books so I was a little hesitant when I heard the reports of the film makers having changed it so much. I was very surprised that the changes actually made me like the movie even more! I mean they stuck true to what CS Lewis originally thought up. Only adding to the story to help with the baseline. Even cooler is the fact that this stands alone as a great movie and people can stop comparing it to Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. It can stand alone in movie History as another great addition to the fantasy genre. And regarding the fear that it might be too ""Christian"" as a lover of the series and A Christian I was also pleasantly surprised that the film makers didn't detract from the original allegory without stressing too much on the fact that its not a Christian movie. The story is an allegory. I saw the context but that doesn't mean that it should only be seen for that. It's a wonderful story and and a wonderful movie that every one should watch. I just hope the filmmakers are smart enough to make all seven.","

"noralee","17 December 2005","The visual success of ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is made possible by the innovations in special effects that were developed for ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. While some of the settings and monsters seem a bit recycled from that epic, the magical creations of the novel are recreated believably and beautifully.The opening of the story marvelously retains the setting of war time Britain during the blitz, complete with an Andrews Sisters song and war reports on the radio, setting the film in a reality where good was clearly fighting evil and evil was ruthlessly attacking civilians (just a bit of imagination is needed to jolt us to contemporary comparisons on either perceived side of several current struggles). While most of today's audience will not know about the evacuation of London's children to the safer countryside and their knowledge of train stations is probably from ""Harry Potter,"" the embarkation farewell is almost as much a tearjerker as Dumbo being separated from his mother.Adding to the verisimilitude are the excellent child stars. Georgie Henley's ""Lucy Pevensie"" could be the granddaughter of ""Scout"" in ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" for capturing wide-eyed innocence and curiosity without any cloying sweetness. William Moseley would get my pre-teen heart beating faster and he seems destined to play Jude Law's son, though without seeing him play with toy soldiers I wonder how ""Peter"" suddenly gains expertise in military strategy and tactics other than instinctively rising to the white man's burden. Anna Popplewell's ""Susan"" is not faint of heart as she combines femininity and tomboy action quite fetchingly. ""Skandar Keynes"" as ""Edmund"" well captures the temptation of sibling rivalry. Too bad they will too quickly age out for the sequels. As twinkly as James McAvoy is as ""Mr. Tumnus"" the faun, Tilda Swinton is is so charismatic as the White Witch self-declared Queen of Narnia, that not only does she immediately get my vote in the MTV Movie Awards as Villain of the Year, even over Palpatine in ""Revenge of the Sith,"" but I thought she was more effective than bland, Liam Neeson-talking lion Aslan, even as she was very Saddam-like using informers, committing torture, imprisonment, habitat destruction and offering candy as bribery (good lesson here about not taking candy from pretty strangers, let alone tattling on your siblings). Too bad her costumes were a bit awkward, but her hair design was both regal and woman warrior.Twenty years ago when I was first introduced to this book by reading it to my sons, I was completely oblivious to the Christian imagery, and could do so with this adaptation as well. Then as now I saw the gifts from Father Christmas as much a benign representation of the positive aspects of the Winter Solstice rather than eternal winter, as Christmas is at Hogwarts. Because the scene of Aslan's confrontation with the Witch is bloodless so as not to frighten children, it seemed more about emasculation to me than sacrifice, though having it take place in a Stonehenge setting seemed too specifically pagan (and that was constructed to celebrate summer any way). The battles are far less violent in clash and final results than in ""The Rings"" saga, which they otherwise imitate.The talking animals are marvelously English, without any contemporarization or mugging that American animation inserts. Particularly fine are Ray Winstone as the voice of ""Mr. Beaver"" and Rupert Everett as the voice of ""Fox."" The wolves are quite the scariest things in the movie, as well as the exhilarating chase scenes, so much so that I don't know if the ""wolf trainer"" credit was literal or animatronic. A warning not to leave your seats immediately after the human participants are identified in the credits: the film continues to set up for the sequel. I didn't even recognize Jim Broadbent at first as ""The Professor,"" while the housekeepers' accent seemed a bit out of place. The centaur wasn't particularly memorable. The closing songs by Alanis Morrissette and Tim Finn were lovely. The score was fairly pedestrian action-adventure, coming to life during the chase scenes and too bombastic during the battles.The dozen or so special effects teams listed in the credits demonstrated the globalization of the movie business these days -- from New Zealand to Guatamala to the Czech Republic and Poland to ILM and Los Angeles.The film is long, but the small children in the audience were only restless during the early set up scenes and were quite involved once the thrilling action started.","

"info-360","10 January 2006","First of all, I didn't read the original book(s) so I cannot say whether the film adaptation is close to them or not. But I did see the film. I am a big big fan of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings worlds. I was excited to see 'The Chronicles of Narnia' as a good mix of those references. Exiting the movie theater, I had one thing in mind: this film is just very poor. The universe is poor, the story is incredibly predicable, (most of) the characters are irritable and shallow, the direction is blurry  And some moments are too long (30 min could easily be cut out without any damage to the story). Well, I am, once more, very disappointed by Disney (Pixar excluded of course). Looks like those people lost their magic after all. Maybe Harry Potter took it all ;-).","

"stranger-23","12 December 2005","There've been quite a few rave reviews of this film, but many of them are raving about the story. The story is undeniably excellent -- there are reasons it has stood the test of time. It's powerful and resonates to adults and children alike.This adaptation, however, was tremendously disappointing. Adamson made the strange choice of cutting out or glossing over several moments in the book that, while small, were pivotal indications that the children were in the process of maturing -- growing from the uncertainty and fear of childhood to the strength and responsibility of young adulthood. This was an important theme in the book; by removing it from the movie, the children are boring, static, and mostly unchanging. Protagonists that do not change through conflict don't make an interesting story.Moreover, due to this being a Disney film, there was no blood or actual violence. This is a book with violent and bloody moments -- battles, deaths, and a pivotal scene of torture and sacrifice. In the movie, at the end of this sacrifice, Aslan looked like a cuddly stuffed animal, not a broken, dead victim. When Edmund was stabbed, there was a little spot on his shirt; no actual blood. There was no sense of the danger Edmund put himself in to destroy the Witch's wand if you couldn't see the repercussions. Why would Disney option a story with crucial violent and bloody scenes if they weren't willing to depict them?The CGI animals were beautifully done -- the beavers, Aslan, Mr. Tumnus. Excellent. No surprise from the director of Shrek. But the green-screen work was some of the worst I've seen in the last ten years; I dread seeing this on DVD if it looked that bad on the big screen.That said, I'd give high marks for the acting. The children did very well with what they had, Mr. Tumnus was one of the high points of the film, and Tilda Swinton took my breath away every time I saw her. Aslan was very well-voiced. Good acting can make up for a whole lot of sloppy directing.","

The movie comes to life in every scene and one can truly believe that Narnia exists and you can get there some way. The acting on the children's part is of a quality beyond their years; showing sincerity that can only be showed by a child. The Centaurs, Fauns, Nymphs, Dryads, Minotaurs, everything was portrays exceptionally well and it exceeded my wildest expectations. The witch was frightening, Aslan was so majestic, Narnia was everything one would hope it would be. Andrew Adamson was the perfect person to adapt the movie into the book. The characters are portrayed as you would envision them when reading the books. I could watch it everyday and never get sick of it. Truly amazing.","

Even with the screaming children, cellphones going off in the dark, and overexcited mothers, I was completely drawn into the world of Narnia. For a person who has read the books many times, this movie was as big to me as Harry Potter.I must say that the Children are the main players in this movie. They capture every emotion, every detail. They EVEN LOOK LIKE EACH OTHER. I also must give a shout out to the boy who played Edmund. In my opinion he was the best outa the entire group. Tilda Swanton as the witch was brilliant. HEr make-up, costumes, and acting was superb. All though I felt as though she wasn't getting the right mood for the witch. In some moment s she was nicer then she should of been.As for Aslan, well..WOW! They pulled him off without it looking corny of puppet-like. Liam Neeson as Alsan, was a great choice. As well as all the other voice actors. They gave their characters more depth then in the book.But what I most noticed was the music. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL FOLKS! GO BUY THE SOUNDTRACK! The Narnian music was lyrical, beautiful and heroic. The battle scenes were just that more because of the music.So, all in all, go see THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA. What are u doing on the computer, go see it NOW! You will not be disappointed.","

"gloshpit","25 June 2006","While technically impressive, this film struck me as slightly soulless - although the acting was overall fairly good (Swinton stood out as a very effective Jadis), it appeared content to dazzle younger viewers with almost cartoon-like visuals rather than engage the audience's attention.It is not without its positive points: Tumnus is also played well by James McAvoy, and the climactic battle scene was at time very impressive. However, the reliance on CGI is a major problem. Although it has been used in the past to great effect to give a realistic feel to proceedings, such as the several thousands of effects in the Lord of the Rings films, in Narnia the effects are very overtly animated, giving some scenes the feel of a Pixar movie rather than a live-action fantasy. To children this would be entertaining, but to older viewers it just seems to be a distraction. Possibly the most egregious case of this is in the rendering of the fox, whose overall effect is quite disturbing, akin to some deformity.Although the look of Jadis, the minotaur and the overall aesthetic of the final battlefield is well executed, there seems to be very little that stands out other than the main characters. Soldiers are faceless and without personality; even the centaur captain Oreius is devoid of characterisation. The makeup effects on a good deal of the evil creatures are again tending towards simplistically rubbery, in the case of the jail monster to the point of being a basic mass. The effects on creating Aslan are technically good, but are wasted on a design that is simply a large lion instead of the glowing, breathtaking spectacle that it should by rights be, and the ensuing reaction from the assembled army that should be present. Rather than this, the film depicts him as nothing more than a kindly general who happens to be a lion.And this seems to be the problem with Narnia - it is content to tread through the story in a very workmanlike manner. It feels slightly forced and on rails, moving from one scene to another as if it were checking the 'fantasy epic' boxes one by one - there is no disbelief from the children when they arrive in Narnia, just acceptance and proceeding to the next area (in the case of Lucy, the acceptance is just a large grin and exhalations for several minutes). There is very little subtlety in the film, instead it just boils down C.S. Lewis's story down to the basic elements and pads them out not with characterisation but distractions. Whilst some critics have cited the religious parallels as a reason to give it incredibly high ratings, taken as a purely cinematic experience it is one thing: A children's film, not a family film.I can't help but wonder how it would have turned out under Peter Jackson...","

"laurakay76","14 December 2005","In all honesty, this is one of the five best films I have ever seen in my life. There are no words that can do it justice. It is a flawless execution of Lewis's masterpiece. Even my husband, who is the king of cinematic nitpickers, couldn't find a single thing in this movie that he thought should be changed. It's simply gorgeous.If you have not seen it, there's no way you can appreciate just how magnificent it is. And if you have seen it, there's no way you can properly describe it.The best way I can think to phrase it is to borrow a line from the movie itself. The beavers, upon hearing that the fox (Rupert Everett) has seen Aslan, eagerly inquire as to what the great lion is like. The fox's answer could be applied to the film as well as to Aslan.""Like everything we've ever heard.""","

"eldakim","17 April 2006","I grew up reading the Narnia books since second grade. I've remembered my teachers reading to me ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."" I'll have to admit, that book was pretty darn good, and I ended up reading most from the series except for book 1. Now this movie came along for the winter, probably the nicest treat a child can get.Narnia was simply a classical tale full of knights, magic, and animals. Hell, it was almost ALMOST like the kid's version of Lord of the Rings. (I mean, the two authors were good friends) This movie had everything coming as expected, unlike how other movies are these days. I don't understand, all the kid's flick these days include some of the most awful films ever. Now here was a classic tale that a kid would enjoy, despite his age and size.I was actually amazed at how much I underrated this film. The actors and actresses all pounded their roles, but I have to admit, Tilda Swanton as the White Witch stole it all. She was amazing as the White Witch. Changing faces from that kind, generous queen to that cruel, arrogant witch made me realize how much of a powerful actress she was. Maybe it was all that makeup she probably had, but the White Witch clearly depicted the villain I had expected her to be. Liam Neeson's powerful voice also matched that of how I would imagine Aslan would be. The clear beauty of the landscape and the epic battle that takes place in a wide terrain made Narnia ever so beautiful and bold. The simple children's story that I held and read came vividly and alive. The special effects had it all, as well.I have to admit, Narnia was one of the best kid's movie I have seen in years. Convincing performances, stylish landscapes, and the beautiful dialogue made this film the most classical experience I have ever felt.","

"cwboldt","10 December 2005","I'll keep this short.The movie is beautifully done. Visually it is stunning, with several 'gasp inspiring' moments. The direction is fantastic- especially with the use of music and silence and sudden chaotic action. The musical score fits perfectly with the movie and is unique.All the acting is very credible- especially by children so young. Tilda is amazing (naturally). Also, I thought I may hate Liam as the Lion, but I honestly didn't.The Christian allegory is all there to be sure, but I don't think Christianity has a monopoly on the theme of self-sacrifice for the greater good. That theme is used time and again in good storytelling. And in the context of this movie, it is utterly powerful.And best of all, the story hasn't been tampered with (too much). Granted there are some differences, but overall the storyline stays very faithful to the book (unlike the most recent Harry Potter movie).This Buddhist DEFINITELY recommends this movie.","

"fgh","26 December 2005","IMDb gives the above number as the budget of this film. I'm wondering where all that money went to: The acting is of the worst kind, the story unbelievably laughable, the dialogue is tiring, CGI and effects look awful, there's no kind of storytelling whatsoever, etc. etc.Here's some of the (dozens of) questions that came up and were left unanswered during this movie:Why are humans so important in that world? Why are pigs and cattle 'bad' animals and others (beaver, fox) 'good'? Why is everybody eager to give their life for some children that never have proved themselves worthy for it? Why doesn't Mr. Tumnus fall over when standing still - I mean, he's only got two hooves and according to physics and gravity he has to fall over unless he scuttles. What did the professor give the children at the end of the movie? Why is the white witch able to put a whole country under snow, but isn't able to kill some inept children? Why does everybody in this movie have to speak in such a momentous and meaningful voice - all of the time? Did anybody ever think about what this raw blend of racism, violence and salvation myths does to the suggestible minds of children (i.e. the target audience)?I guess the idea behind all that was just to make tons of money from people wanting to see some pseudo-Christian-and-fantasy-themed movie. So they spent 1.50 $ on screenplay, actors, effects and direction respectively and the rest of all those millions went into advertising to trick people into paying money for this thing. It's the only way I can understand how such a piece (that would get the worst grade at every writing and directing school) could make it onto screen.Go for the 1989 version instead - at least it had no budget to go along with no story, lame acting and even worse effects. Or simply wait till it's on free-TV - don't support something like that with your hard earned money.","

"kallizmartin","22 January 2006","Where to start? The sole reason I went to see this movie was because my mother had 4 free tickets and she invited me and a friend. I had no expectations other than that I was pretty sure that it was going to be a LOTR-type of movie for kids. And I was pretty much right. But it still S-U-C-K-S.First off, the acting was terrible. In my opinion, Tilda Swinton as the White Witch was the only highlight of this movie, and she was the only reason I didn't fall asleep during the movie.The child-actors were impeccably....awful. They spent 180 million dollars on this movie. And for what? Most of it was computer generated, and even that wasn't done well. The green-screen use was a load of crap, and I have seen better in my media class in my school. And with such a huge budget, they could've spent some dough on teaching William Moseley (Peter) how to carry and wield a sword without looking like a victimized redneck retard who's about to stand up to his father in a domestic quarrel (even though the sword would have been misplaced in such a situation).I wont bother picking on the other actors, because anyone that saw this, and anyone that will, will know what I'm talking about here. When I saw this movie in the theaters, I didn't realize all the allusions to the bible for some unknown reason, but after reading some comments in here, I totally agree with all of them.The battle sequences were short and monotonous and boring. Not were they any exciting, and it all seemed like the director tried to make something like Peter Jackson did with his magnificent LOTR trilogy. This movie doesn't even come close. not even.BTW, does anyone agree that Mr. Tumnus first seemed like a pedophile when he met Lucy the first time? Tilda Swinton and some of the technical aspects of the movie were the only good parts about this, but what does that matter when the story and storytelling is horrible? The only thing I could think of when leaving the theater, was how much one could've gotten for that wardrobe on some auction. And the only reason I give it a 2 in rating is that it had one part that was completely superb - the end credits - it marked the end of this cinematic equivalent of a turd. Skip this turgid mess.","

"whoadizzle","22 May 2006","At first i was skeptical of this movie, not really sure how much i would appreciate it, considering it might be too childish, however i was extremely surprised, after getting about halfway through it my skepticism quickly changed to excitement. it is quite obvious that this movie is made by the same creator as Lord of The Rings, which is a great series. The picture and quality is amazing and looks and feels so realistic like you are right there in the action. The fascinating details of the odd creatures and the way they look so real makes it so believable. I loved this movie and highly recommend it to anyone who can appreciate movies such as Lord of The Rings...you won't be disappointed.","

"zena-1","23 July 2007","Is it such a good idea that a young child goes home to tea with a stranger, even one who has hooves? Perhaps, given the age in which we live, it is not the best example to set. I grew up in England during the war in question and well remember a teacher telling us at the age of nine or so, that there was less danger as fewer people had cars in which to abduct a child, (and little or no candy with which to tempt us). Yes this is a delightful film and the effects are astounding, with a touch of ""Pan's Laberynth"", but perhaps some sort of warning could have been included. The vast majority are kind and would certainly never harm a child but there are exceptions, as we all know.","

"Lark_Pash","17 May 2006","I doubted this movie from the beginning. I couldn't see how they could make this small little book into something amazing, but they did it! I had fluttering in my stomach watching it on the big screen. Little Lucy's expression was charming and Edmund was very believable. I could see a little bit of everyone's naughty little brother in Edmund. The Narnia world was overwhelming and all I could do is wish I lived there. I really appreciated that the movie stayed along the ""Christian"" lines too. The lion was so real and majestic. Even I felt a tingling of fear at the first sight of him. Even so, it was as if he were a best friend forever once he spoke and you wanted to just jump into the screen and hug his furry mane.",NA
"qtpie66662000","3 December 2005","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Whitch, and the Wardrobe, based on the series by C.S. Lewis, was amazing! It made me want to see it again, and I am. It had wonderful visuals, effects, and also, in this movie, you will experience hate, compassion, and even fear. Throughout the movie, you learn many lessons and see who your friends really are. This movie contains humor for both parents and children and it is a movie you will enjoy. The best part of the movie was the scenery. It was just absolutely gorgeous and took your breath away. The characters were so real to life, and the situations the children encounter were realistic and you could really empathize with the movie which you do not get in a movie like Harry Potter. Although Harry Potter is a wonderful movie, not all people can identify with Harry and the other characters with the situations they face. With The Chronicles of Narnia, you can empathize and understand someone not believing you, or also for those who were in World War II, the experience during that time. Overall, this movie is a must see and highly recommend it.",NA
"Gbradley13","27 June 2007","What's good about it: It has OK special effects, and OK acting. And some OK momentsWhats bad about it: Its WAY to long, and boring and you know what that means? IT NEEDS MORE ACTION! Its runs at about 2hrs. 20min when they could have made it 1hr. 30min!Overall: Boring, and it stinks, I only suggest you see this if you liked the book. I don't think there should be a sequel! It you want to see this watch EPIC MOVIE for the same story! Or you can just read the book(which wasn't that great either) MPAA: PG for battle sequences and frightening moments.MY RATING: PG for some brief battle sequences and some frightening moments",NA
"maylinnmisaki","18 December 2020","I give the movie a 6/10. I didn't really understand the plot to be honest, and everything went by a bit too quick for my liking. The acting was a little bit weird as well, I didn't get that emotional feel when I watched it. That scene where Edmund got stabbed was almost painful to watch. It was supposed to be sad but it wasn't, the wound was barely visible and it just didn't have that ""panic"" feel to it. I also feel like Aslan came back to life too quickly, and I didn't really understand why. I also feel like the fight was a bit too favored. Like if Peter didn't have that main character luck, he would've lost. I really disliked how fast the witch was defeated, it was disappointing. I wish we had more info on their parents and the ""rules"" of Narnia, maybe I missed it but I feel like we needed more information than that. I wish there was more backstory about the closet as well, there was too little info and things were going too fast in my opinion.",NA
"dramafreak_03","26 December 2005","C.S. Lewis' ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" has bewitched audiences for fifty years, and - after seeing this movie - I'm sure that the legacy of Narnia will live on for many years to come.From the opening scenes set in London, with a beautiful score by Harry Gregson Williams, it is evident that what we are about to see will be powerfully realized. And so it was. The film, directed by Andrew Adamson, is in turn is breathtaking, scary, funny, entrancing and poignant.Featuring a stellar cast of renowned British, New Zealand and American actors, performances are fabulous. As the four children, William Moseley, portraying Peter - the teenage boy torn between childhood and manhood - and Anna Popplewell, as the motherly sister Susan, are fabulous in their roles. Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes deliver stand-out performances, showing talent and skill beyond their years.Tilda Swinton, as the White Witch, perfectly captures the icy and chilling menace of her role. Audiences sympathize with James McAvoy, as the friendly faun Mr Tumnus. Ray Winstone and Dawn French put in a delightful turn as the Beavers. Liam Neeson is perfect as the great lion Aslan.Andrew Adamson's imagination has not been limited, and his rendition of C.S. Lewis' modern fairytale perfectly captures the magic and mirth of the original novel.Bringing C.S. Lewis fans to a state of ecstasy, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a triumph for the cinema.",NA
"Mstopangahead","2 January 2006","This was the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I saw it 6 times in the theater and it just got better every time. The music, directing, acting, special effects, and costumes make Narnia seem so real. I absolutely loved it. I hadn't even read the book before seeing it, but it sure did inspire me to read all of the books (finished The Last Battle last night). One of the reasons why I love this movie is because it's so beautiful to watch. The scenery and the cinematography are so amazing. If someone asked me to pick my favorite scene, I couldn't do it. All of the scenes are my favorite. It's a movie that works on so many levels. From little kids, to teens (like me), to adults, and to those who see the Christian symbolism and to those who don't, this is a great movie.",NA
"noonflyproject","28 December 2005","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was simple an amazing and captivating film, full of life and representative of the deep imagination of C.S. Lewis. The parts were well-cast, the animation was incredible and appropriate, and the battle scenes were quite exciting.All of the characters were represented well, especially the four Pevensie children. The four child actors truly understood their characters and brought them to life. Tilda Swinton as Jadis seemed to be off at first, but soon became quite convincing as the White Witch, demonstrating her wicked and relentless nature through her calm but stern personage. While James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus seemed to be the weakest and most scattered character, he did possess enough charm to play off his seemingly flat expressions. All the voice-overs were great, and the conversations between the beavers offered timely comic relief. Liam Neeson as Aslan seemed at first to be almost too predictable, but his booming voice worked great with the awesome appearance of the lion.In terms of animation, the movie was a true triumph. The creators chose just the correct mixture of realistic and clearly CGI animation to present the animals and beasts in a fashion that reminded the audience of the fact that while they were fantasy creatures, they appeared to be perfectly in place in the magical world of Narnia. Not once throughout the movie did I think to myself that the animation looked ""fake"" or ""overdone,"" and it was the way in which the animators depicted the entire world of Narnia, the landscapes and creatures, that made it appear so delightfully real. I especially enjoyed the facial expressions and speaking of the creatures, which was very realistic.Finally, the movie was completed by the awesome battle scenes that took place near its end. In true Lord of the Rings style, Weta Workshop crafted a fully-armed battle that could stand up to those of the Jackson series. However, a comparison of the Lord of the Rings' battles and the one in Narnia cannot truly be made, for the movies are completely different. Narnia was much more a fantasy than LOTR, simply because it possessed a real world and a fantasy one, while LOTR was completely fantasy. It is for precisely this reason that the battle scenes, full of minotaurs and ogres, centaurs and satyrs, worked so well, and were seen as not only appropriate but a true triumph of modern animation.Overall, Adamson should be highly commended for bringing the genius work of C.S. Lewis to life in this movie. I only hope he will agree to make more movies in the series. If you haven't seen it, you must, and prepare to be truly captivated by the magical world of Narnia.",NA
"msloane1","5 January 2015","Let me say right up front that I am an atheist and a secularist and such do not care about any religious allegory or undertones this movie may possess. I am reviewing it from the point of view of the book to movie transition and how good it is as a fantasy film.The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is a fantastic fantasy film. The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe has an awesome feel of magic and wonder to it. This movie is reasonably faithful to the book and even makes some improvements on it. I really appreciated that the filmmakers actually showed the kids being evacuated from the wartime air raids. In the book this is mentioned once in passing at the start of the first paragraph. But in the book I never got the sense of children who had been truly affected by the war. The movie, by actually showing the evacuations and making them a decent length scene, and by showing some of the kids emotions in the midst and aftermath of this scene, better capture the fact that the kids are sent away during wartime and how this has affected them emotionally. After that the movie pretty much follows the book and is generally quite faithful to it with one exception. The Deeper Magic From Before the Dawn of Time is eliminated and replaced by Aslan having a ""different interpretation"" of the Deep Magic From the Dawn of Time. This eliminates a major plot point and alters another. This is not a good thing. Everything else is mostly as you'd expect. The visual work on this movie is fantastic. The outstanding visual work both help capture the sense of wonder and magic of Narnia and make the story feel more realistic. My personal favorite scene was when Lucy first entered Narnia through the Wardrobe. The pure joy and wonder of discovering Narnia is a beautiful thing to behold. And it feels so genuine. The filmmakers had Georgie enter the set of the wintry Narnia blindfolded so that her very first reaction to seeing the set could be used in the film as an authentic first reaction. What a brilliant move! The CGI animals, especially Aslan, look pretty realistic to me. Now the casting and acting were fairly good. Goergie was a PERFECT Lucy and Liam Neeson was an outstanding choice for the voice of Aslan. William Mosley just fit right into the role of Peter. An underrated role is Jim Broadbent's portrayal of Professor Kirke. The only weakness here is that the character of Edmund seems a bit forced and phony but overall the casting and acting are good. The pacing is a bit slow in the first half hour or so but picks up when the children have all gotten into Narnia and is pretty good from there on. To address a common complaint, a number of people have complained about the ""bloodless"" battle. First of all, remember that this is fantasy. More importantly, it should be noted that the filmmakers were contractually required by the studio to attain a rating of no higher than PG. Thus, we wind up with battle scenes that are violent and intense but not bloody or gory. Now, this movie should not be viewed by toddlers, preschoolers, or kindergarteners due to intense and intensely sad scenes, especially the evacuation scene, the Aslan sacrifice plot, and the epic final battle. This movie is okay for kids in grades 3 and up. For kids in grades 1-2 it depends on the individual. I don't think this movie is as good as the Harry Potter series or the Middle Earth trilogies but it is a worthy part of the fantasy genre and is well worth seeing.Faithfulness to the book: 8 out of 10. Casting/acting: 8 out of 10. Special effects/visuals: 9 out of 10. Pacing: 7 out of 10. Overall: 8 out of 10.",NA
"Chronicles_Of_Narnia","3 December 2005","As many people can tell, I am a huge fan of Narnia, with that being said, I was treated to an early screening of Chronicles of Narnia.Wow!

"Lilestchicken","17 January 2006","The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a very good film which does the book fantastically, if they have edited any bits or cut and bits out you cant tell it does the book justice I recommend it to any one even if the have read the book they will enjoy it. Unlike Harry Potter which was terrible as they missed key elements of the book out of the film this does not. I also recommend tissues as there are some very upsetting moments Husbands and Boyfriends beware if you take your Girlfried or Wivies and Young Children they will cry. This Film is Fanstatic I recommend that everyone should go and watch because they will love it. It shows that with good directing and editing you can make anything look good.",NA
