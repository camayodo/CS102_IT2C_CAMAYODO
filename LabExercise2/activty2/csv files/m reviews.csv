"Marshall-D-Teach","6 March 2020","Exactly the right movie at exactly the right time. The music and atmosphere, the sets and costume design, the special effects, the cast. Everything lined up perfectly for a young shaggy. That kid was a gothy nerd with love for video-games, horror, industrial music and Mila Jovovich. This movie managed to check all the boxes. Watching it now, it still pretty much holds up. Maybe a little cheesy but stylish and entertaining. 6 stars for watchability, one for nostalgia.","

"enkephalin07","16 January 2005","I had to sift long and deep for a good comment on this. Why all the hostility? I think there was great chemistry on this production and it shows; the actors and crew involved loved the game and had a good time making this. This movie successfully recreated the feel of the game, and because it kept exposition to a minimum of what you needed to know for this particular story and didn't borrow from or revise any of the original characters or settings, it supported and strengthened the franchise. No story is retold here, no words are wasted, the setting, feel and pace is familiar to fans of Resident Evil and yet it's perfectly accessible to those unfamiliar with the broader storyline. Not giving the fan-boys their favorite characters was a good choice since characters tend to get mangled in adaptation, and yet the fan-boys still complain. With this film you have a good, watchable story that can partake of the Resident Evil cosmology, showing it due respect.It did an excellent job establishing characters without too much unnecessary background, developing them just enough to make you want to know what they'll do next, to make you care before the sudden and gruesome happens to them. The acting was above par for a Resident Evil, certainly much better than the first game. The plot was no more comic bookish than any of the games. My one complaint was that the characters were too battle-trained, too slick, too good at fighting for them to be sympathetic horror subjects. This could've been balanced out with more reaction shots showing the soldiers wetting themselves. But Alice's over-the-top commando-style action made her too much of a super heroine to really make anyone concerned about her survival; characters made of Teflon make good action but apathetic horror subjects.","

"teslaman","29 November 2007","As a big fan of splatter and horror films i was gladly surprised when i watched this. I haven't played the game so i had no idea what to expect and had nothing to compare with. I really feel that this pays homage to the old zombie films at least to an extent. The zombies here are a little bit faster though.It begins with a nice back story and then builds slowly in pace to a climactic frenzy. The effects are top notch, solid directing, a really imaginative and eerie production design and great acting.Yes, i may be a little biased but i really like Milla Jovovich. I think this is the kind of role that fits her best, strong kick ass attitude with an odd personality wrapped in a seemingly fragile shell. Her performance here reminds me a bit of the character she played in ""The fifth element"" and also the character in the later ""Ultraviolet"" The other actors did a good job as well so she's not the only one to get credit although the movie revolves around her character. The child AI is a very nice and creepy addition to the atmosphere.The RE theme could have ended up as a nice trilogy but the sequel unfortunately lacks nearly everything(except Milla) that this film delivers. Not that RE2 is a complete mess but nowhere near this. I haven't seen the third installment yet but even if that one holds true in quality to this one number two becomes the odd one out.If you like zombie and action films you'll certainly like this one.","

"cherold","8 October 2003","This movie means business. Quick disaster with a mystery to it, jarring deaths, naked Milla, all in the first few minutes. It keeps up the pace throughout. In terms of critical comments, yes, you don't really care about the characters, but so what? How often do you really care about the monster fodder in horror films? And true, it wasn't a literal working of the movie, it didn't take place in a mansion and it didn't involve exploring lots of rooms and solving puzzles. That's because it's a movie. A literal translation of Resident Evil would probably be really dull. Games and movies are very different mediums. I don't think some people here understand that. One guy said he thought the movie rocked but after repeated viewings he thought it sucked, and that's a video game player attitude - movies don't have to have good replay value, it's okay to enjoy them once. I only enjoyed Star Wars once, but I don't think it sucked, it just didn't have a lot of depth. Not every movie has to be Citizen Kane. It was an engaging story, moved like lightning and had some excellent scares.","

"DVD_Connoisseur","22 June 2007","First things first, I really like ""Resident Evil"". While I can't comment on the success of the conversion to a movie as I've never played any of the numerous video games, the film is beautifully shot and has an urgent pace. It also has a great looking cast, a thumping soundtrack and plenty of boys' toys.Milla Jovovich is stunning as the heroine, Alice. Whoever thought of casting Jovovich in this role deserves a bonus. Watching this beautiful star kick various forms of zombie butt while wearing a short red dress is a wonderful experience.Anderson's movies may be accused of being style over substance but there's no doubting that ""Shopping"", ""Event Horizon"" and ""Resident Evil"" are fantastic examples of eye candy. Every shot is beautifully composed and the film has a high-budget sheen.8 out of 10. Casio G-Shock fans will be in their element watching this movie.","

"repojack","8 November 2020","I originally watched ""Resident Evil"" at a movie theater when it was first released in 2002. I hadn't played the games. There was no Rotten Tomatoes and I didn't read reviews back then so I went in blind. And I utterly enjoyed the movie: the story, the action sequences, the underground ""Hive,"" Mila Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez kicking serious ass, and more.Panned by critics (36% RT) but liked by users (67% RT), Resident Evil was one of the first examples of how mainstream critics just don't ""get"" horror. Movies that try to be artsy get great reviews even as key elements fall flat for the rest of us. The recent ""Beach House"" is a perfect example of this -- it was loved by critics (81% RT) and panned by users (28%).Unfortunately, the rest of the ""Resident Evil"" sequels except for a few moments, rarely captured that first movie's originality and allure. Instead, check out the writer/director's excellent previous outing ""Event Horizon.""","

"mbworm","7 January 2008","""Resident Evil"" was a smart and scary game. The darkness and the surprises were huge scare factors. In that famous game, you find yourself trapped in a mansion crawling with the undead because of a mistake made by the Umbrella Corporation.Director Paul W.S. Anderson makes a fast, dark guilty pleasure of a film from this game with ""Resident Evil"".Milla Jovovich is Alice, who wakes up in a creepy, poorly lit mansion at night in a remote forest. She has no memory of who she is or why she's here, but after a group of soldiers bursts in and takes her to a hidden lab underneath the mansion with them, she quickly begins to realize a terrible secret. She and the others find themselves locked in ""The Hive"", an enormous, elaborate underground structure that was sealed by the supercomputer controlling it. It soon becomes evident that an experiment called ""The T-Virus"" escaped into the air and killed everyone. But nobody really stayed dead. Now the remaining survivors must fight their way back out of The Hive before the door seals permanently... and at the same time they must contain the virus before it reaches the surface. The film moves at a breakneck pace, with some elaborate sets and great cinematography that sets the dark mood well for this atmospheric sci-fi thriller.","

"Dragoneyed363","29 April 2008","Resident Evil is probably my favorite zombie movie next to Planet Terror. It had flaws, some acting was poor, but still was one great time from start to finish and excellently crafted entertainment!!!!! It had wonderful action, nice gore and the performances overall were exceedingly decent for what they needed to be for a video game adaptation. I especially love Michelle Rodriguez's portrayal of Pain; amazing character. I first thought when I was watching this film that it was going to be an over-the-top gore movie with way to much blood and carnage, not so much as focusing on the main point of the story, but it turned out unimaginably well, for I thought it wasn't going to be that good at all, and the complexity and edgy scenes and screenplay surprised me. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez acted wonderfully in this film and this was a great action\horror movie that I am extremely glad I was able to have seen, and will gladly see over and over again.","

"dilapidated_mind","2 April 2005","Where to start, I am a big fan of the Resident evil series (well the first 3 anyway) and once news reached my ears that they were making a movie of the first game I was pretty excited. But then I actually sat down to watch it, and to say the least was very disappointed with the out come.BIG SPOILERS AHEAD The film begins in an underground laboratory owned by the corporation Umbrealla inc. The lab is hidden deep within the basement of a mansion. Some asshole releases the virus the scientists are working on which can reanimate dead cells. The scientists get contaminated.Now when I saw this I thought fine its not 100% accurate but hey it still has the potential to be a great movie.NOThe computer within the lab goes psycho, sealing all the rooms off under quarantined regulations, then it begins wiping out all the scientists. Some woman wakes up who has lost all her memory. Deciding the time is right to go for a walk in the cold while wearing nothing but a highly revealing red dress she sets off on her journey, minuites later an army team burst through the windows and join her in her quest to do... not much. About 25 minutes further into the movie this team comes to a large hallway. The hallway leads to the computers core where they can shut it down. And low and behold the computer kills off 2/3 of the cast with its lasers faster than you can say ""danger Will Robbinson danger"" The survivors shut the computer down; zombies come out, and the team being of the greatest intellect decide the best way to execute the undead is by leg shots and shouting ""Stop"" a good 14 times. Team intelligence then decide they shouldn't have tried to switch the computer off, and so they switch the computer back on. Near the end of the film we are introduced to the ultimate biological weapon resembling a single licker, no I'm not kidding, they also incorectly name it a Hunter, where the hell is Tyrant you might ask? It's not as if it was an important part of the series, Tyrant virus and all. Our film draws to a close as the ""ultimate killing machine"" discovers its huge weakness it touches train tracks and promptly explodes.*yawn* The film has few plot twists which I wont spoil here. Most of the enemies from the series don't show up, in fact, the majority of the film concentrates on the evil computer not the creatures. Not even zombies.This movie would have been much better if it WASN'T called Resident Evil, but something else, anything else. Really, it bears little relation to the video games anyway besides the virus's and corporation's name and I still feel this film was only called Resident Evil so Paul Anderson could sell his hand me down script and market it towards a wider crowd (maybe this could be attributed to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within as well). The point is if this movie was called Cube 3 he could still get away with it. In fact this film probably is Cube 3, just named Resident Evil to attract fans of the series to watch this very average zombiefest.Oh well it can't be as bad as Street Fighter the movie.","

"claudio_carvalho","31 January 2017","In the near future, the powerful Umbrella Corporation has a hidden research facility called The Hive underneath Raccoon City, where the scientists develop genetically engineered drugs for medical purpose and biological weapons. After stealing the lethal T-virus, a thief contaminates The Hive and the artificial intelligence Red Queen seals the Hive and kills all the staff and guinea pigs. A woman called Alice (Milla Jovovich) awakes naked in a bathroom of a mansion without memory and soon a commando led by a man called One (Colin Salmon) subdues her and another man called Matt (Eric Mabius), who claims to be a cop. Alice learns that she is a security guard with her partner Spence (James Purefoy) assigned to protect the entrance to The Hive and her memory will return in an undefined period since she was affected by a gas. The Red Queen had a malfunctioning five hours ago and had shut down the facility and killed everybody releasing a lethal gas. Now they need to shut down the Red Queen and restart her systems. They use an underground train to reach The Hive and the Red Queen asks then to leave the place. However Kaplan (Martin Crewes) disables the Red Queen opening the doors in The Hive. Soon the group learns that the staff has turned into zombies and now they are under siege of the zombies. Most of the commando dies and only Alice, Spence, Matt, Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) and Kaplan survive. Now they need to find a way to escape from The Hive since the system will shut down the exits in a short period. Who will survive?""Resident Evil"" is a great sci-fi action horror film by Paul W.S. Anderson. Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez and the rest of the cast have good performances and the non-stop action is engaging. The gloomy pessimist conclusion fits perfectly to the story. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Resident Evil: O Hóspede Maldito"" (""Resident Evil: The Damned Guest"")","

"FiendishDramaturgy","13 January 2005","To be honest, the first time I saw this, I didn't care for it. It did not follow the story line of the game, and that made me very unhappy with this endeavor.Upon realization that a video game is ""dumbed down"" for the players to be able to concentrate, however, I opted for a second viewing and came to realize that this was not the waste of time I first believed. I was disappointed with how it played out because there were no cures along the way, they made little notice of records and files lying about, no matter how relevant they were or were not, and the sequence of things was not on par with that of the game. I realize that to do things that way would have severely hampered the flow of the movie itself and would have made it far less active. Considering this is first and foremost, an action movie (with horror elements), that would not be considered a good thing.The truth is that Milla Jovovich contributes a very capable and entertaining presence and performance to this work. Her supporting cast (every one) gave nothing but the best they had. The story itself flows quite well and was creatively written and executed. There is nothing wrong with this attempt. It just didn't live up to a fanboy's expectations. Unfortunately, that was their major principal audience; game fans, and that explains the lackluster box office payoff and the low IMDb user ratings for this attempt. The fanboys were disappointed; the casual fans casually attended this event; and the mainstream didn't understand the big deal, either way and so did not participate to a profitable level.With the release of the second installment and all the advertisement and hype Apocalypse received, it drew the mainstream fans a bit harder; the casual fans were less casual; and the fanboys were still disappointed, but resigned to the fact that this was just how it was going to be; take it or leave it. We took it and, in retrospect, embraced the first attempt, as well.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.","

"Smells_Like_Cheese","7 September 2007","Recently I saw the theatrical trailer for Resident Evil: Extinction and it occurred to me, I have never seen the first two Resident Evil films, and I always wanted to see them. So I rented the first two Resident Evil films and watched them last night. I had a lot of fun watching Resident Evil, it was very high action and kept my heart racing on what would happen next. This is a great movie based on a video game, this is the kind of movie that we need if we are talking about basing it on a video game. I haven't seen a good one since Mortal Kombat. The action and effects were so awesome not to mention that there are some very awesome scares in here. Very cool make up for the zombies; and the story was excellent.A virus breaks out in a lab called the Hive where everyone is held in captivity and dies. All of a sudden we see a woman passed out in a shower, she has no idea who she is, she meets two other men who have no idea who they are, but they are taken by soldiers who take them underground to the Hive. There the three learn that they are fighters for this out break and that also they might be part of what happened. The main thing is that they control the Hive, but that gets more difficult when the virus has turned the people it killed into the living dead, zombies. The woman, Alice, turns into the leader and must find out why this happened and also how they can get out alive without contaminating the world.Resident Evil was an awesome movie to watch and I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves action movies. If you loved Mortal Kombat I'm sure you'll love Resident Evil. There are so many great scenes, but my favorite was when Alice saw the evil dogs and they chased her throughout the lab, it was really scary but so awesome to watch. Well, you'll just have to see what I mean. Milla Jovovich was just a perfect choice for Alice, she is such a cool character and now I'm really looking forward to seeing Extinction.7/10","

"Zod-2","4 October 2002","I was generally surprised that I liked this movie, not being a fan of either of it's stars.  I decided to give the movie a try since it does deal with one of my favorite horror topics...zombies!As a horror movie Resident Evil fails miserably, it's not scary and contains only small amounts of suspense.  It is much better as an action film although much of the action is chaotic, accompanied by lame heavy metal/thrash music.  But seeing as it is based on a video game and made primarily for teenage boy video game addicts it is quite good in and of itself.The movie plays well, even though it is apparent that some scenes have been cut to achieve an R-rating.  The characters do what they need to do in order to survive.One small problem with the movie is the relative lack of zombie screen time. They do appear in two major scenes but most of the time the hallways are clear.  This hive was supposed to employ thousands of people but you only ever see 100 zombies at the most.  Also, the humans seem to be able to travel easily wherever they have to go until it is time for another action sequence.  It would have been better if they constantly ran into single zombies which they were able to easily dispose of, but this is nit-picking on my part.Overall I enjoyed the movie and I have never seen, let alone played, the video game.  I'm not sure if this movie will have the staying power over multiple viewings for me (like Aliens) but it's a very good single viewing action picture.  Easily the best movie I have seen based on a video game. Despite it's flaws Resident Evil rates a 7 out of 10, if taken more seriously this could have been a really good movie.  It would have been nice to see a George Romero version.","

"kluseba","12 June 2020","Resident Evil is the first of six live action movies based upon the Japanese Biohazard video game franchise. The movie tells the story of a mysterious attack on an underground research facility known as The Hive that is owned by Umbrella Corporation. A specialized commando attempts to enter the vast complex and find out what has happened. Three amnesiacs who are found near the facility are captured by the the commando. The group soon realizes that the scientists have been murdered and that the research facility hides abominable secrets that put their lives in danger.This movie has aged surprisingly well. The special effects look barely dated and convince with a gripping dystopian atmosphere. The locations are particularly intriguing as the entire movie takes place in a dark underground research facility and its immediate surroundings. The soundtrack underlines the film's atmosphere and comes around with sinister, liberating and gripping nu metal and alternative rock music. The story comes around with a few twists and turns. The characters are quite intriguing, especially enigmatic lead character Alice played by an excellent Milla Jovovich, tough police officer Rain Ocampo played by Michelle Rodriguez and the holograph played by Michaela Dicker who represents the facility's artificial intelligence known as the Red Queen. Resident Evil offers a balanced mixture of atmospheric and tense sequences and brutal and dynamic scenes. The combination of action, horror, mystery and science-fiction elements is also quite balanced.In the end, Resident Evil is certainly one of the very best live action movies based upon a video game franchise. I initially watched this film as a teenager and liked it but I have recently been watching it again as an adult and have come to the conclusion that I like it even better today than I did back in the days. The movie is in the spirit of numerous horror and science-fiction movies of the late nineties and early years of the millennium such as Cube, Equilibirum and My Little Eye. If you like these films, you are going to adore Resident Evil. Make sure to check out the video games as well if you haven't done so already.","

"jboothmillard","19 September 2005","Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, AVP: Alien vs. Predator, Death Race, Pompeii), I had always heard of the popular zombie survival horror video games series, and I had enjoyed the George A. Romero Living Dead films, I was hoping for the same entertainment with this video game based film. Basically the film starts in the secret underground laboratory located beneath Raccoon City, called The Hive, owned by the Umbrella Corporation, an accident occurs and a deadly chemical called the T-Virus is released into the facility, the artificial intelligence security system, The Red Queen, traps all workers inside to contain the infection. Alice (The Fifth Element's Milla Jovovich) awakens alone in a deserted mansion, she is suffering from short-term amnesia, she is shortly accompanied by police officer Matt Addison (Ugly Betty's Eric Mabius), before he is subdued by a military unit, sent by the Umbrella Corporation. The commandos consist of leader James ""One"" Shade (Colin Salmon), Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez), medic Chad Kaplan (Martin Crewes), J.D. (Pasquale Aleardi) and two others, they have been assigned to shut down the main computer and quarantine the virus, and along the way also meet fellow amnesiac Spence Parks (A Knight's Tale's James Purefoy), he was in a sham marriage with Alice, to protect the Hive's entrance. To get to the Hive the team must first travel the long underground train system to reach the facility, and pass through the various, and dangerous, security and weapon systems they unintentionally activate, including a laser defence system that slices most of the commandos into pieces. Alice and the remaining members manage to get to the circuit board containing the Red Queen system, it is deactivated and all doors are unlocked, but the team had not counted on the release of a horde of zombified people, these undead creatures were formerly the staff working inside the Hive, they have been infected by the T-Virus. After battling with these flesh hungry mutated people, Alice suggests reactivating the Red Queen who will be able to explain what happened in the Hive, the artificial intelligence explains the infection that spread, that the virus is contagious and reanimates dead bodies with an impulse, they are driven by the basic need to feed, one bite or scratch from a creature and that person will become one themselves, trauma to the head is the only way to kill them. The team try to navigate their way out of the facility and back to the train to reenter Raccoon City, but the zombies are all over the place and blocking their path, as well as mutated dogs, and an experimental beast made from evolution in human flesh, and they must also be careful not to bring the effects of the T-Virus to the surface and spread the infection further. Also starring Ryan McCluskey as Mr. Grey, Oscar Pearce as Mr. Red, Indra Ové as Ms. Black, Anna Bolt as Dr. Green, Joseph May as Dr. Blue, Heike , Makatsch as Lisa, Jaymes Butler as Clarence, Stephen Billington as Mr. White, Fiona Glascott as Ms. Gold and Jason Isaacs as Dr. William Birkin, also narrating. Jovovich is great being the kick-ass woman who slowly regains her memory and a bunch of martial arts and gun skills, Rodriguez is also feisty, the supporting cast all do well also, the special effects and makeup for the zombies, mutated things and scientific stuff are all cool, and the music by shock rocker Marilyn Mason gives the action edge, it is exciting compared to the rubbish or average sequels that followed, a great science- fiction horror action film. Good!","

"noah-65732","2 November 2023","Despite its commercialism Resident Evil is really good zombie movie. The story follows Alice in her struggle to regain her memory and uncover the secrets of the Umbrella Corporation's T-Virus which turns people and animals into zombies and/or mutants. The movie has great camera work, decent special effects, a creepy soundtrack and lots of action. Some of the acting is a bit half-ass and some of the dialogue is a bit cliché but overall it was pretty well done for a movie based on a video game. This installment is the strongest film in the Resident Evil Saga. I recommend this for fans and non fans of the genre.","

"PredragReviews","22 May 2016","""Resident Evil"" starts off with a slam-bang double-opening - inside an ultra high-tech underground research-and-development facility, something goes terribly wrong and a gas escapes as the facility's emergency system kicks in, locking down the building and resulting in the apparent deaths of hundreds of employees; at about the same time, above ground, a young woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up inside a grand mansion with no memory of who she is, only minutes before the place is stormed by a group of well-armed commandos. Thus begins the successful movie adaptation of the ""Resident Evil"" series of video games.The acting here is equally note-perfect: Milla is at the top of her game and shows off her acting chops as well as her more corporeal talents; in the hands of a lesser actress the role would have been generic action-flick fodder. Michelle Rodriguez (Ocampo) keeps snarling and cracking wise 'til the bitter end; Eric Mabius is charmingly and appropriately plastic (where is his character coming from, anyway?) and also carries off his role like a champ. Colin Salmon (James ""One"" Shade) once again bravely carries Shakespearean delivery into Anderson's laser jaws of death, while James Purefoy does what he has to do as the poor man's Chris Lambert. He's a good villain, and because of that you end up rooting for the zombies and even the disgusting ""Licker"". A word should be said about the special features here: while it's a treat to have a ticket to the less ambitious ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"", fans of the original will find the six segments on the special effects centerpieces of the film tasty, particularly in the mix between good old-fashioned animatronics and CGI. The alternate ending is amusing for completest, if only to show just how critical a solid editor can be. And without a doubt, the hysterical main commentary track with Anderson, Jovovich, and Rodriguez is worth the price of admission alone. Lucky, lucky Paul Anderson! Overall rating: 8 out of 10.","

"Richie-67-485852","17 August 2017","I remember the first time I caught this it was by accident (?) The opening sequence where they explain an underground facility intrigued me so I stayed with it. It pulled me right in. The story is rather unique and they pull it off in a credible way. Who doesn't like a secret underground city type facility, run by a computer that has had a breakdown of some sort being investigated by an elite squad of Marine types? It just captures you as the story unravels quite nicely. It had some nice scares and twists and just when you think you are out it pulls you back in more than once I might add. Its just a well executed movie. While I prefer no nudity in the movies, this was understandable as the story presents it. It does distract but for Hollywood that means $$$. This went on to launch a series of movies so need for me to go on and on. Give a look-see and find out what this is all about. BTW...I like to eat while watching. However, Zombie films don't stimulate the appetite and this had plenty of thrill-action keeping you occupied. Do have a tasty drink and perhaps some sunflower seeds on standby. Enjoy","

"educallejero","29 March 2019","Entertaining movie based on a video-game. That's not an easy job.They managed to create a compelling personal story for the main protagonist (Mila) and explained the context and plot very efficiently.Once the action kicks in, the pace is great and the survival aspect mesh really well with the intriguing plot. The characters are thin, of course, but they work too, without annoying ""comic-relief only"" or ""the defenseless"".I don't know, but I'm sure someone could find plot-holes, but overall, if they exist, you don't notice while watching this good video-game zombi movie.","

"onionbagel","29 January 2017","Let me start off by saying 2 things: 1. I have played all the ""core"" Resident Evil games (1-6). 2. I like the 6 movies more than the 6 games.Review for if you've played the game(s): The first Resident Evil movie starts off in the mansion much like the first game, but doesn't stay there long. Alice (the protagonist) (NOT in the games!) wakes up with no memory and ends up going below the mansion to a place called ""The Hive"" (Umbrella Corp's secret facility). Her and a group of Umbrella spec-ops are tasked with containing/killing a leaked virus before the infection spreads across the city above (and the rest of the world). There are of course zombies and ""lickers"" (from the games), but also an ""enemy"" called ""The Red Queen"" who is the security AI that locked down ""The Hive"" to contain the disease. In the end, Alice (and one other member) escapes to find Umbrella scientists waiting for them back in the mansion. Alice is taken to a lab in Raccoon City and her friend is put into the ""Nemesis Program"".Review for if you HAVEN'T played the game(s): A girl named Alice wakes up with no memory in a fake mansion above a secret government facility. In this facility, a virus is spread and the facility is locked down by the AI running the place. Alice and some spec-ops agents must kill/contain the infected in order to prevent the spreading of disease to the city above (and the rest of the world). FINAL VERDICT: If you're into action movies, zombies, bad-ass girls or all of the above, you'll like this movie. If you are a HUGE fan of the Resident Evil video games (especially the first one), you may not.","

"InaneSwine","22 February 2010","For die-hard fans of the original 'Resident Evil' video game series, this film may come as a disappointment, as the general horror and darkness that made the games so unnerving has been ditched here, in lieu of an intense action-thriller. Nonetheless, in its own right, this film is highly entertaining.Milla Jovovich puts in a superb performance as Alice, who is lead into an underground base of a multi-national corporation to do battle with a series of ghoulies and monsters, including a horde of the undead. With terrific co-star Michelle Rodriguez, there is never a dull moment, moving at a furious pace with just the right mix of dry humour, mystery that surrounds the ""Umbrella Corporation"" and its motives, and impressive action sequences featuring an agile Jovovich in the dress she's barely wearing performing some remarkable stunts.","

"paul_haakonsen","17 July 2020","Well, being a long time fan of the ""Resident Evil"" games - been playing those since the original game was released. So having a movie adaptation for the franchise has been good. Well, at least it started out alright, and then as the franchise progressed, the steam just deflated the balloon.I will say that writer and Paul W.S. Anderson actually managed to capture the essence of the ""Resident Evil"" games with this 2002 movie, and at the same time he managed to make the movie action-packed and thrilling, as I doubt a movie as slow paced as the game would prove for less adequate entertainment.I have watched this 2002 ""Resident Evil"" movie about four or five times already over the years since it was released. And I can honestly say that this particular first movie in the franchise keeps being as entertaining as it was the first time I saw it.There is a good storyline to the movie, albeit it is one that is very familiar if you have played the games, for better or worse. But still, regardless of you having played the games or not, there is something in this 2002 movie for just about everyone in the audience.The movie has a very great cast ensemble to portray the various characters and roles, and I think they casted people quite well for ""Resident Evil"". Normally, I am not overly keen on Milla Jovovich, but she carries herself quite well as Alice. Furthermore, the movie also have the likes of Eric Mabius, Martin Crewes and Colin Salmon. And of course then there is also James Purefoy and Michelle Rodriguez, and ""Resident Evil"" really is their movie, because they were really outstanding in the movie and portrayed their characters with such grace and intensity.For a zombie movie, then there is a lot of action in ""Resident Evil"", and it works out well, especially since the movie starts out slow, dropping hints to the fans and slowly builds up the atmosphere and director Paul W.S. Anderson lines up the events quite well and executes them great on the screen. I will say that ""Resident Evil"" is a very intense zombie movie, and it definitely feels like you are right there in The Hive, deep underground with the characters in the movie.Something that should be said worked really well for ""Resident Evil"" was the way that it was filmed, lots of scenes were so true to what you experience in the games, such as long corridors, enclosed spaces, etc. That was just pure candy for us fans of the games.The movie also had good zombie make-up and effects. And of course, this being a ""Resident Evil"" movie based loosely on the first game, then you also have the zombie dogs and the lickers. Now, the zombie dogs were really great. And while the lickers are a crucial part of the ""Resident Evil"" lore, then the CGI here in this 2002 movie really didn't do them full justice, as they looked like what they were; CGI animated. It was a shame.""Resident Evil"" is a movie that can be watched over and over.My rating of Paul W.S. Anderson's 2002 movie is a seven out of ten stars.","

"Fella_shibby","19 February 2017","I saw this first in a theatre in 2002. It is a fast-paced, high octane zombie flick filled with brisk action sequences. Revisited it recently on a DVD. Seen all its sequels in theatre. The plot - A virus has been released inside a secret underground lab, turning its workers into zombies, a military task force is deployed to take care of the problem. The lab is filled with traps n packed with flesh-eating creatures n ferocious dogs. The film actually does an efficient job of recreating the ambiance of the video game. The initial office building chaos is great and there's a bit of nastiness involving an elevator scene. The film is famous for its laser defence system scene, the zombified dogs, awesome fight scene with the zombie doberman dogs n different creatures. It is also an adventure film in which the lead characters, especially Milla Jovovich always move forward without looking back. Another known face, Michelle Rodriguez is at her sexiest when wielding a weapon. Paul W.S. Anderson famous for action/horror/sci-fi films did a fine job with the direction.","

The plot is a little slow. But it picks up. The laser hall scene was intense. The music score is awesome. The script and direction is fast moving. It ends in a cliffhanger for a sequel. The licker monster was awesome. The zombie dog scene with Alice facing against them was awesome. The cast is great.Overall, Resident Evil is an awesome film that is loud, action packed, and entertaining.","

"boondocksaint20","11 August 2002","Yeah, I've read the other reviews and I agree...Super Mario Bros, Double Dragon, Street Fighter...any movie that is based on a video game has killed itself before it's even been released.  I am a big fan of the RE games, but honestly was not too thrilled to see this when it came out in theaters b\c of the above facts.  To me, there was no way that anyone could come close to translating that game into a good movie.  So, when this hit the video stores, it was 'the hot' dvd for the time being, so I indulged myself and bought it for the heck of it.  Man, was I pleasantly surprised!First off, I agree with 99% of the other negative reviews on what was negative about this movie...wooden characters, little to no character development, cheesy CGI at the end, etc.  But despite these annoyances, I couldn't help but admire this movie.  I mean, this movie defines how atmosphere should play a huge role in any movie.  The Hive is filmed as a dark and spooky place, grim and bleak from the sudden loss of life of the Umbrella employees.  Paul Anderson once again, like in Event Horizon, concentrated all of his efforts on atmosphere and direction and it shows. Like the story, this movie really makes everything feel like a dream, like you've just woken up from a strange dream into a weird type of Alice in Wonderland nightmare.  Marilyn Manson did an excellent job with the score, it is appropriately creepy and gives a feeling of both naivety and desperation.As for scares, there are a few, but the surprises far outweigh the frights which is actually good in this case.  I liked how everything was going on in the beginning and you really don't know what's going on until 30 minutes into it, and Milla Jovovich finally asks what we're all wanting to know. This is just not a conventional action/horror flick at all.  It offers a big factor of unpredictability, and not just cheap plot twists that make no sense, but instead, real human reactions if this were really to happen in real life.  Though the characters were underdeveloped, their expressions fit their roles.  Milla looks incredibly hot, especially at the beginning and the end.  She always has this innocent look on her face like she knows something noone else does that totally goes with the movie.  Michelle Rodriguez, though cliched (I think this badass woman thing started with James Cameron's masterpiece, Aliens) really convinced me that her character, Rain, was truly a take no prisoners, show no fear, take no crap soldier especially when she's fighting.  Both women make the movie, period.  The others, well, are just there as zombie fodder, though a lot of the deaths were totally unexpected (not so much who would survive, but when said people would buy the farm).  With this in mind though, I will agree with some other reviewers that there weren't enough zombie deaths, nor gunfights (if you think about it, these commandos really did not bring very much ammunition, nor did they think about picking up their fallen camarades' gear) for a zombie flick, but like I said earlier, this one is very untraditional.This movie really stays true to the game, which is as unpredictable as they come.  Anderson even pays homeage to it by using some of the same camera angles (die hard fans will love them).  And the scene with the attack dogs was refreshing since it was done without CGI.  The direction is solid. Enough said.All in all this is a good movie.  It has a great beginning (that will give you chills down your spine) that literally keeps you glued to the screen, and a slightly weaker second half that delivers as well.   Milla and the atmosphere alone are worth the price of viewing.  This is one of the better horror films to come out in the last ten years.  I give it a solid 8.5 out of 10.","

"dfa120374","15 January 2015","The Umbrella Corporation is a top secret company operating from a massive underground facility known as The Hive. After a deadly virus is released into the air, resulting in the deaths of all who work there, an elite squad of soldiers is sent in to shut down The Hive before the virus has a chance to escape into general population of the city above. It's here that they come across Alice (Mila Jovovich) who has no memory of who or where she is. As they continue down into The Hive, Alice starts to regain her memory bit by bit, but they all soon discover that shutting down the The Hive is the least of their worries when they learn that the human population have returned to life as vicious zombies.Resident Evil is one of the much more enjoyable game-to-movie adaptations as usually these are pretty mediocre or just plain awful (Street Fighter, Double Dragon, Super Mario Bros. etc), and fans of the game should be pretty pleased with this movie version as well, especially as the makers of the movie have brought in the formidable creature known as Licker who features in the game also.The action for the movie is really good, which is accompanied by a pumping soundtrack to get the adrenalin going that wee bit more as well. A good few special effects are really well done also, especially in the scene that involves the Red Queen using a laser as a defence system, and the effects for Licker was impressive making it just as scary in the film as it was in the game.Just one thing - this isn't a gore-fest of a zombie movie either and concentrates more toward the story, so if you're expecting (or hoping for) lots of splatter then you'll be highly disappointed.Resident Evil is an enjoyable film to watch. It's not a thinker of a movie, obviously, but it's not supposed to be and doesn't pretend to be either. Also, don't expect an exact game-to-movie film. It's an adaptation OF the game, so enjoy it for what it is - a good zombie horror/sci-fi action film.","

"Wuchakk","4 October 2013","Paul Anderson's ""Resident Evil"" was released in 2002 and is based on the video game of the same name. I don't play video games so this review is based solely on the film.Since its release I never gave the film any thought, but the red poster & DVD cover with Milla Jovovich in a ripped red dress somehow snuck into my subconscious over the years. Then I caught a 15-minute snippet of the film while channel surfing (not knowing it was ""Resident Evil""). The part I saw was near the beginning where Milla mysteriously wakes up in a shower in a mansion. She obviously doesn't know who she is or where she's at and wanders around the mansion trying to figure things out when -- BAM! -- something happens, but I don't want to give it away.That's all I saw. I didn't have time to watch anymore but I decided right there to pick up the DVD. The set-up is intriguing and brilliantly executed.***PLOT SPOILER*** (Don't read the next paragraph unless you want to know the basic plot) A biological ""accident"" causes the supercomputer that runs an underground complex to shut down the entire facility and gas the 500 workers to death. This installation is called The Hive. The mansion is a secret emergency entrance and a commando force is sent by the Umbrella Corporation to go down and find out what caused the supercomputer -- the Red Queen -- to shut down the facility and kill the people. It turns out that a virus has turned the 500 Umbrella employees into hideous flesh-eating zombies, which may sound totally absurd but the way it's explained in the film is somehow believable, for a sci-fi movie anyway. Milla and the commandos slowly discover the truth. Can they get out alive? ***END SPOILER*** POSITIVES: As already noted, the opening is truly intriguing, successfully capturing the viewer's attention.The slow revelation of the mystery is superb, including who Milla really is.Milla herself is stunning. The entire film she runs around in a red dress with a slit up the side. Her face and expressions are magnificent.The story itself and the delivery (sets, etc.) ring of brilliance. This is sci-fi of the highest order.The film features a cool eerie score highlighted by some rocking nu-metal acts.NEGATIVES: Although ""Resident Evil"" is original in many ways it's sometimes reminiscent of other films like ""Aliens"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"". Hence, some things are predictable; for instance, you know anyone who gets bitten by a zombie is gonna eventually turn into one.To be expected, the mystery build-up in the first hour is better than the last half hour, which is action-filled. Why? Mindless action with numerous quick edits somehow always becomes boring. Wouldn't it be great if a sci-fi-horror film like this ended in a truly unconventional blow-your-mind way (like the original ""Planet of the Apes"")? But the final sequence makes up for it, sort of. Besides, since the film is based on a video game the slaughter comes with the territory.The film runs 95 minutes before the credits roll.PERSONAL GRADE: A-","

"SILENCEikillyou","9 August 2002","This movie has it all; if you like flesh-eating zombies, horror, guns, secrets -characters with amnesia and stuff, powerful monsters, and/or the game; you're gonna love this one.  I did!  But if all that I just mentioned isn't enough, see it for the performance of Milla Jojovich, alone.  As you may have guessed I'm a fan.  I've not necessarily liked all the movies she was in, but her performances are everything I look for in a great female character.  Pretty and pretty strange!!  I don't know, she just always makes the movie, for me.This movie had more than that, though.  Great graphics and plot.  Cool characters and acting.  Eerie atmosphere without too much dream-like strangeness.  It had just the right mixture of everything.8/10 - I've seen better; but not much.thank you","

"dineshaishu","29 July 2019","This movie means business. Quick disaster with a mystery to it, jarring deaths, naked Milla, all in the first few minutes. It keeps up the pace throughout. In terms of critical comments, yes, you don't really care about the characters, but so what? How often do you really care about the monster fodder in horror films? And true, it wasn't a literal working of the movie, it didn't take place in a mansion and it didn't involve exploring lots of rooms and solving puzzles. That's because it's a movie. A literal translation of Resident Evil would probably be really dull. Games and movies are very different mediums. I don't think some people here understand that. One guy said he thought the movie rocked but after repeated viewings he thought it sucked, and that's a video game player attitude - movies don't have to have good replay value, it's okay to enjoy them once. I only enjoyed Star Wars once, but I don't think it sucked, it just didn't have a lot of depth. Not every movie has to be Citizen Kane.It was an engaging story, moved like lightning and had some excellent scares.","

"Junker-2","22 September 2002","""Resident Evil"" follows the all too familiar path of a couple other recent movies: ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" and ""The Ghosts of Mars."" All three start with an interesting plot but end up just being about zombies instead. (Or vampires. Or whatever.) It's as if in all three cases the writers got bored halfway through and said ""Oh, heck. Let's just throw in some zombies.""  (Or vampires. Or whatever.)I don't mean to suggest that ""Resident Evil"" is terrible. It's okay. But the frustrating thing is that, like those other two movies, it could have been so much more.In fact, the initial plot is rather intriguing: We are set in a secret, underground facility where biological weapons are being created. But something has gone seriously wrong and the computer that controls the facility has started killing off the people who work there. Now an outside team must penetrate the facilities defenses and attempt to take control of the situation.And then...! And then...! Zombies!Milla Jovovich stars as a helpless female who needs protecting at first but soon becomes a tough chick with moves that would do Jackie Chan proud. Okay, her transformation is explained by a memory loss that is slowly regained, but it seems the producers wanted it both ways: Helpless and tough at the same time. Michelle Rodriguez is at least consistently the tough chick throughout. But her constant ""I'm tough, get out of my way"" routine gets old quickly.In fact, it is interesting that Rodriguez is second billed in this movie. This seems to be the case only because there was no one else to give second billing to. The male characters are all poorly drawn and very difficult to keep track of. I kept forgetting which one was supposed to be the bad guy.Sure, some of the action sequences will keep your interest. Milla's battle with some zombie dogs make the movie worth giving a chance if you have nothing better to do some evening. Still, the next time I decide to watch a zombie movie I think I will pick one that is a zombie movie all the way, and not one where the zombies were thrown in because the writers got bored.","

"allstarrunner","10 July 2018","I remembered seeing this movie back in the theater, and hadn't watched it since so I thought I would watch it again since I wanted to watch all the RE movies and hadn't seen the last few (or any after the second one). 
The movie holds up surprisingly well after all these years - I mean the overall tone of the movie is clearly dated - it *feels* like a late 90's movie - not that that is bad per se. The acting is mediocre, but I never really care too much about that anyway. I just rate stuff on if I am entertained or not and I can say that I was indeed with this movie. It also helps that it is about 90 minutes. I don't think this style of movie could go on for much more than that - the jarring soundtrack I think would get a little too over the top if I had to keep hearing it for another 30 minutes. 
Overall the movie still hold up and is entertaining all these years later. Still worth a watch.","

"iamsam103","23 December 2005","I went to the cinema having high expectations for the film. I was and still am a huge fan oft he games, especially Resi 2. I was expecting the characteristics of the game to be int he film; gore, suspense, violence, zombies and some nasty monsters. I was in for a huge disappointment...The film starts off OK, with some unknown figure unleashing the T-Virus but then it goes circling out of control. Whereas there are some elements still retained from the game(laboratory is under a mansion outside Racoon City and is owned by Umbrella Corporation it seems that the director got bored of transferring the franchise to film, and instead made the rest up. What follows is a mindless adventure as some elite soldiers go through the underground lab to try and stop the threat of the virus. Of course, there are zombies, but the overall look of then pales in comparison to Dawn Of The Dead (2004). Whereas some of them have gruesome wounds, 80% of them are just very pale and have makeup and fake blood. Along with that, there is no suspense. And what happens is that a zombie(s)will emerge, and along with tons of shooting, rock music appears.The big bad boy boss monster is the licker, who most Resi fans will know and appreciate as a med-i-okre monster, not too challenging. This thing however is made out to be the mother of all creations and is very disappointingly realised with bad CGI. There is no suspense here, a total lack of blood and gore, and only one monster. True fans of the Resi games will be and should be disappointed.That said, their are a few things which raise Resi from the dead (sorry for the pun). The ending climactic train set piece is enjoyable and fast paced, and the laser hallway (imagine, 3 soldiers, trapped in a hallway, with lasers that chop things in half) is pretty neat. There's also a cool appearance by some zombie Doberman dogs, however they're quickly killed off in a silly action scene.This film could have been so much more if the director would have ditched the possibility for ""cool stunts"" and gone for more style, suspense and horror. Even when the heroes are outnumbered and surrounded by zombies, you never feel as if they are in THAT much danger....when in a situation like that you should be on the edge of your seat.For zombie lovers, there are better choices out there. George A Romero's Dead films, the remake of Dawn of The Dead (04, Saun Of The Dead and even 28 Days Later serve up better chills and scares than this med-i-okre action fest.","

"dormesher-21565","13 November 2018","Resident Evil loosely based on the game series of the same name. I like this film and the live action series I know alot of people would disagree and I will say the quality of the films drops quite a bit after extinction but I have alot of fun with series and I am a fan of these and the video games.This is the first film in the series and it's a great start to this franchise with an interesting storyline taking place in the Hive which is a government research center run by the evil corporation Umbrella and a zombie outbreak occurs and the characters have to deal with that and the Red Queen who is an Artificial Intelligence that is in control of the Hive.This is a very fun movie with some pretty cool action and some interesting characters. However I will say that there are some issues I have although it's based on the game series they don't use alot of characters from the game's which is annoying for me because I grew up on those characters like Leon Kennedy and Chris Redfield and even Whesker now I know they show up in later movies but they feel more like side characters because the movie series focuses on Alice who is an original character for this franchise.
And even though it annoys me that they dont use characters from games right I will say Alice is a really interesting character and a bad ass and is brilliantly acted by Mila Jocovich who is awesome in this film and the franchise.The effects have dated quite Abit in my opinion but still look pretty good for 2002 and like I said the action is pretty awesome and alot of cool scenes in the movie.
The Licker looks ok and had some interesting action scenes with Alice and the crew.Theres also some pretty cool twists which involve Alice and her partner who she guards down with turns out she wants to take down Umbrella and was trying to sneak the T Virus and her partner overheard this and caused the break out in the Hive to begin with. That was a cool twists and really brought alot to the character of Alice in my opinion.It also sets up a sequel with one of the survivors going in for the Nemesis programme setting up the next villain which awesome for a fan of the game'sVerdict 8/10 enjoyable but dated movie","

"BA_Harrison","7 March 2011","When a film version of Resident Evil was originally mooted, George Romero was down to direct, a fact that had long-time zombie fans like me drooling in anticipation; eventually, however, Paul W.S. Anderson got the gig, a guy who, to put it mildly, has never been as revered by horror fans as old-timer George. While I have never really understood the dislike for Anderson, finding his films to be mindlessly enjoyable popcorn fodder, I had to admit I was also disappointed by the news, and just a little bit wary.Imagine my joy, then, when Resident Evil was finally released and I discovered that Anderson had done a bang-up job, delivering a superb balance of ballistic action and atmospheric horror that stayed faithful to the source material to please the gamers and yet remained just as accessible to non-gamers; sure, part of me still wanted to see what George would have done with the film, but I was thrilled with the results nonetheless.Nowadays, having seen Romero's last three chapters in his Dead series (Land, Diary and Survival) and sadly realising the the guy no longer has the magic touch, I reckon that hiring Anderson was the wise decision after all. Although not as gory as I would have perhaps liked (you can never have too much splatter), Resident Evil is a quality slice of zombie mayhem: Anderson's direction is slick, without being too showy (ie., he doesn't resort to an overkill of trendy editing), there are some cracking special effects (for the day), and the cast all do a great job, with feisty female leads (Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez) not only kicking zombie butt in style but lighting up the screen with their loveliness in the process.","

"turnewil-26767","15 December 2018","I haven't really seen this movie in like 5 years since I seen it on TV. Thought about getting it on DVD. I was blown away with this movie. Killer Action and Zombie Flick. Ferocious Dogs try to kill Milla Jovovich and she didnt back down without no fight. Unlike The First Purge, this was actually one to ode. Actually a trilogy to catch up on if you missed them in theaters. The next one I want to see is Apocalypse, Extinction, Afterlife, Retribution, and the Final Chapter. So there should be a total of 6 films, right.","

"michaelRokeefe","25 January 2008","A strong Sci-Fi thriller from director Paul W. S. Anderson. Super F/X sustains the sometimes gory action. Alice(Milla Jovovich) and Rain Ocampo(Michelle Rodriguez)are two members of a commando team assigned to infiltrate an underground research lab owned by the Umbrella Corporation. An out-of-control supercomputer has engineered a virus that has accidentally been released and has turned most of the scientists and employees of the facility into rampaging flesh eating zombies. The commando team will risk life and limb to reach the ""Red Queen"", the lab's supreme brain-power computer hoping to halt any possibility the virus is let loose on the world's populace. Upon investigation it seems that the virus was not released by accident at all and there may even be a cure for the undead...besides putting a bullet in the head. A decent survival horror flick. Also in the cast: Eric Mabius, Ryan McCluskey, Anna Bolt, Heike Makatsch, Martin Crewes and James Purefoy. A very strong R rating for your enjoyment.","

"jncarr","24 August 2003","Resident Evil was a suprise in that it is a rather good film.  Milla Jovovich helps this by being easy on the eye.  The action was fairly well paced with some good scenes that made you jump and it was also great to see a lot of the chracters from the game, we did not see enough of the dogs.  I felt where the movie mis-fired slightly was that it had a subplot with Milla's character and few others suffering memory loss.  I don't feel it added to the movie just made you think what's going on.  I would have prefered a straight forward action film in the vain of Aliens where she takes the role of Jill Valentine.  That would have rocked.  The ending is left wide open for the sequel, let's just hope that this is the direction they go in for that one.","

"kosmasp","30 December 2010","When I first watched this movie, I was still under the impression, that it could have been made by George Romero. Not a good state of mind to be watching any movie then (at least for me). If I had rated it back then, it would have been a worse rating I can assure you that. Especially because I had read a script (a first draft), of what Romero would have done with it.But as it is, the movie kicked off (literally) a series of movies. And when I re-watched it recently, I did so with the commentary on. And when you listen to the people talk about this movie passionately, you can't help but almost fall in love with it. I was tempted to give it a very high rating then. I think the middle way was good though. There are things that have been done good here (some of the action, the suspense stuff, the casting of Michelle Rodriguez) and others that haven't (the story, the rest of the action as Rodriguez does say so herself on the commentary and some other things).All in all a decent horror movie, but nothing to get too excited about.","

"Boba_Fett1138","22 November 2005","""Resident Evil"" didn't exactly received raving reviews when it got released. It however is an enjoyable action flick with some horror elements in it, that is worth seeing.Looks like only people really disappointed with this movie were and are the fans of the video games this movie is based on. The movie has very little to do with the video games but should that automatically mean that the movie is a bad one? I don't think that's exactly fair assumption. You should just take this movie for what it is; An action/horror movie that happens to be loosely BASED on a video game. As a movie it really isn't bad. It might not be the best or most original movie, it still is an enjoyable action flick that is perfectly watchable.Still its a movie with flaws. Biggest flaw is the continuity. Not everything that happens in the movie makes logically sense. for instance in the beginning of the movie all of the characters are suddenly split up, without any explanation why and how this happened and of course every character gets a bad encounter during their split up. There are several tiny things like this in the movie that don't make logical sense from a story point of view and the continuity and editing are weak and flawed at times. All little hints that director Paul W.S. Anderson isn't the greatest director in the business.The movie also isn't exactly successful as an horror. Most of the scare moments in the movie fail and are too much and too often the same. The action is good, although predictable. Nothing in the movie happens as a real surprise and because of that it also never really becomes tense or truly exciting. It's really one of those ""Aliens""-wannabe movies. It's too bad but it doesn't automatically mean that this movie is a bad one. It's still a movie made with lots of style and profession and even though it isn't the most original movie it still is a successful one, from a movie technical point of view.It's obvious that Milla Jovovich was just cast because of her looks but she does a fair enough job in this movie. Michelle Rodriguez is a good action movie star and Colin Salmon is a great actor but his role is too limited. The movie could had really used his acting abilities and his character more. The wonderful Jason Isaacs also has a uncredited cameo toward the ending of the movie and also as narrator.A movie worth seeing at least once. You might end up liking it better than expected, as with me was the case.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","

"Hellraiser-1","13 July 2002","Ok, this movie is well done and some people appreciate it quite a lot but I felt it just as a disappointment. Milla Jovovich is gorgeous and the zombies look good but the scenes involving them are not gory at all.I think Paul Anderson did a good job in ""Event Horizon"" and even in ""Soldier"" which was better than expected but here he uses a too much video-clip style and the movie was quite uninteresting. And there is another thing I cannot understand, if this movie was so little successful in the USA, why are thinking about making a sequel?At least I hope it is like the Video game, that is,a zombie flick more than this is: A mixed of a lot of things all together.","

"y-68479","7 February 2020","So GORY and repulsive!!l mean it! This one frightens me to death,absolutely.And I enjoy it that way.It's one of the most thrilling Sci-fi films I've ever seen,though containing some terribly gory scenes.(some people were sliced into pieces by the dreadful lasers!)Needless to say,this one also involves some other elements that are a must for sci-fi films.The unbearably weird silence in the Hive,the drab zombies,disgusting monsters and the sudden mutation of human beings nearby.....all those keep jarring and pinching my nerves !I nearly cry out: OMG !!as if all these were just happening in front of me!!True to life... definitely.
Also I have to say that the film may be a little hard to understand at first, yet you will finally find all the scenes and plots are carefully designed.No flaws!Perfect!
For this classical thrilling film,i will give 10 stars.Really good.","

"Kamurai25","1 July 2021","Great watch, will likely watch again, and do recommend.I understand that zombies have been done to death by the time I wrote this, but I've always enjoyed them, and I understand that, as a movie franchise, ""Resident Evil"" is fairly laughed at, but the first movie was somewhat promising, even if it didn't REALLY have anything to do with the video game.If nothing else, Milla Jojovich and Michelle Rodriguez are quality actors and carry the movie very well, though I honestly think the cast does well.I'm all for unique movies, and, at the time, this felt like one. It is well remembered for a particular death scene.If you like zombies, then you should like this one. It just has this evil corporation trope looming in the background.It does a great job of slowly escalating the situation, if in a slightly absurd way.","

"grouchoM","10 August 2005","I loved this movie. I don't particularly like horror movies and I have never played this game. I must say that from beginning to end I was hooked. I loved the way it was shot and the casting though none of the names were what I would consider big names. Michelle Rodriquez busts out and nearly steals the show from Milla. She is tough as nails and kicks butt but is still sexy as can be. Milla as Alice is just fantastic and dead on. She is great as the innocent confused Alice who can't remember who she is or what is going on. She sees these events through the confused eyes of an innocent. Then as she remembers who she is the transformation is great and she comes off like King Kong, Godzilla, and Bruce Lee all in one. She looks great and she carries the movie and has shown she is an excellent action heroine. Milla can do anything.","

"Reaktor-","27 July 2002","I wasn't waiting to see anything amazing when I started watching for this movie, since almost all the license movies have been terrible... Fortunately, my opinion was to change! Movie was great, actors were good enough, and there was actually a plot (whoa!). Director has done a great job by having that videogame atmosphere by use of light, but still keeping the movie tense. Marilyn Manson has also made a great job by composing some of his greatest soundtrack titles which really fit for this movie. I have played both Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2, and recognized many of the scenes which were kind of similar to games. What can I say? For the people who have played games, this one gives good vibes and they are going to love it. For regular people the movie might be above the average. This was one hell-of-a-movie, and I'm waiting for the sequel.","

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","26 October 2020","It's a well-known fact that 'Resident Evil (2002)' has very little resemblance to, well, any of the video-games in the series it is based on. It has a mansion and some familiar monster designs but that's about it. This isn't atmospheric horror, it's schlocky sci-fi. Of course, that alone doesn't make it a bad film. It's the choppy editing, forced early-2000s edginess, poor CGI, bland characters and barely-there plot that does that. There are occasional moments of hammy ridiculousness that come very close to replicating a certain B-movie charm (see Milla Jovovich running up a wall and spin-kicking a zombie dog through a window), but these moments are simply too few and far between. For the most part, the piece is just dull. It also suffers from some major story and character issues; I literally can't think of a reason why the focal military unit actually enter the H.I.V.E. and there's more charisma in a loaf of bread than there is in any of the lead performances. The whole thing is just a mess. It has a few enjoyable moments but, overall, it isn't particularly entertaining. 5/10","

"paulclaassen","22 February 2021","'Resident Evil' is very different to most zombie films out there. The film revolves around a very powerful company, the Umbrella Corporation, which - unbeknownst to most of their employees - also designs and manufactures warfare weapons. The Hive is an impressively designed underground mega structure which houses over 500 scientists. We soon learn the company is being sabotaged, and it is this very sabotage that would ultimately lead to devastating consequences, as we discover in later installments in the franchise. Spence (James Purefoy) is the man responsible for this sabotage.We really don't know much about Alice (Milla Jovovich) during the first half of the movie. This is a very clever and interesting set-up for a character that is to lead six films. Her beauty is utilized by sensual photography and poses - very well integrated in the situations she finds herself in, and most unusual for a film of this genre, yet it works so well. The mystery surrounding her lingers for quite a while. In fact, we keep guessing and speculating almost until the very end.What starts as a rescue operation ends in a fight for survival in an excellent display of fantastic visuals and make-up effects, and lots of action. The film grows more intense as it progresses, and all the more awesome - if you have the stomach for it, that is. It is thrilling from beginning to end, with nail-biting suspense from the opening scene until the closing finale. It is so fast-paced, it hardly allows the viewer time to catch its breath. Be warned, there are highly effective jump scares! I loved this.","

"kensmark","31 March 2002","Mild non-specific spoilers ahead.I had high hopes, but Resident Evil wants to be a zombie movie and an action movie, and it fails utterly on both counts.You can't have a good zombie movie without gore.  Or without some decent zombies.  The zombies in this movie are feeble, except for the dogs, who have hardly any screen time.  The movie also has a rather hastily concocted monster, which serves as padding.  The gore that does get onto the screen doesn't have any continuity with the action, as if the victims of violence in the film wandered in from an alternate universe where they died of different causes.And you can't have a good action movie without action.  Milla has about one-and-a-half good action moments in this film, and the rest of the cast manages another two.  Those are supplemented by a lot of inaction and a lot of loud nonsense where they try to confuse you into thinking something interesting is happening.  Dull, dull, dull.Shaking the camera a lot during a close-up of someone waving their arms and screaming is not an action scene.  It's passe and pathetic and wasn't a decent substitute for action back when it was relatively new, in the mid-80's.The movie has a few moments of genuine atmosphere, but those have all come and gone by the twenty-minute mark.  There are some nice props, but they generally don't get much use, and some nice sets, although the gross overuse of the close-up generally obscures them.  The cast shows some promise, but they don't have much to do, and the dialogue is all too often wincingly bad.The movie relentlessly copies better films, and does it poorly, a long and annoying reminder of what you could be watching instead.Most mysteriously of all, the film contains nudity, but none of it serves any purpose.  The movie already had an 'R' rating for violence.  The nudity isn't necessary or flattering.  I admit, rarely have I seen a movie in which an attractive woman appears without her clothes and thought the movie would be better without the nudity, but it happened here.All in all, it's not as interesting or exciting as watching someone play the game.  Or hearing them talk about having played the game.  It's not even as good as the director Paul Anderson's earlier videogame movie, Mortal Kombat. As the final credits rolled, I was easily able to think of almost a dozen zombie movies that are far, far superior -- and only two of them are Japanese.Weak, dull, derivative, amateurish, under-written, under-directed, and generally disappointing.  I feel bad for Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez, who I know can do so much better.","

"dromasca","8 September 2002","I do not like zombies movies. It's a matter of taste, but none of the after-death genres really speaks to me. I must however confess having enjoyed 'Resident Evil', especially because it is very well made - but I might have never seen it if I knew what it is about when I rented it from my local Blockbuster. This would have been a miss.The director, Paul Anderson seems to specialize in movies inspired by computer games (another sign of the culture of our times, but why not?). This is his second one after 'Mortal Kombat', and it works much better. His other sources of inspiration are Lewis Carrol's Alice, '2001 - The Space Odissey', and of course the other zombies movies in the last 20 years. The combination works, and I think that this is first of all because of the clear and sure director hand. The story line is of a corporate having almost total control of home computers ('evil' Microsoft comes in mind immediately), and performing secret biological weapons experiments behind the scenes. When something goes wrong, zombies are not late to show up and start eliminating the humans around. It's not especially original, but all is well linked, there are no major  flaws, and even the quantity of pretentious laughable quotes is beyond the usual limit.Milla Jovovitch and Michelle Rodriguez are the feminine stars in the movie, easy to remember as they are both beautiful and well-casted. The rest of the actors team are decent. Effects are well filmed, and provide the needed quantity of horror for the fans of the genre.The sequel is already in making, and I intent to go and see it.","

"RoboRabbit89","5 March 2018","I first seen this back in 2004 on a VHS copy that my buddy owned, he myself and another buddy watch it together.Since It was my first experience seeing the movie I totally loved it,
which was surprising because at the time I wasn't sure about it, since it was
a horror movie, I stayed away from them a lot as a little kid.
The suspense is quite creepy but not too creepy because it's also an action
movie blended in to one, however this first installment is more suspense with
good jump scares and small action scenes.
The pace is fast and the movie is kinda edgy in music and action sequences,
I've seen the remake of the original game which my one buddy owns on Game Cube, it's good but also really creepy and I like that the movie captured that essence.
Alice played by MIlla Jovovich is the heroine of the film, who has amnesia,
as we met her she comes to the shower, which looks like she hit her head,
she is oblivious to things as the audience is, we lean what's going on as she
does. Which I feel is fresh for as zombie movie.The movie is 100 minutes but fairly fast paced and has an engaging story,
so you met characters as the movie goes. Alice is joined by special forces-like
operatives that inform her and a couple other characters about what's
going on.
Video game purists will not like this movie but casual audiences will probubly
enjoy it, it's made to be popcorn fun that's all, it should not be looked at as
anything else but a fun movie however haters will hate so each there own I
guess.Overall I enjoy the film to this day, for me it's a guilty pleasure.
I give it a 7/10. If you want a fun but suspenseful action film
with fun action scenes and great scares look no further.
Give it a look. It's fun.","

"tabuno","27 January 2019","8 August 2002. ""Resident Evil"" was more intelligent than ""Aliens,"" and the twist and turn in the movie was good. I'm not a fan of slasher/horror, and living dead movies, but I eventually settled into the movie with its scientific sounding rationale gunk. I was terrified (although not scared, as if there's a difference). I particularly liked how compassionate some of the scenes were, while the beginning indiscriminate killing was quite effective in setting the tone for the rest of the movie.It's really difficult to describe what it was about ""Resident Evil"" that made it stand out above the usual blood and gore movies. The touch of humanity, the computer logic, the seriousness of the military discipline? Somehow, all the parts seemed to work together. Milla as an actress did a great job with a number of different portraits of human behaviors and emotions. The script was a notch above the usual cut and slash. Somehow the ending even seemed apt and complete creating both the typical uneasy shucks reaction but at the same time yeah ok, I understand, a decent ending - serves you right.","

"shanfloyd","14 January 2003","When Capcom's game of the same name first hit the market, it got many critic's praise due to its unique gaming style and for its excellent atmosphere of horror and suspense. Six years later, this movie version has neither followed the story or characters (this movie is rather a prequel of the game) nor presented that unique atmosphere of survival horror. In the end it turned out to be a cheap action movie with blazing guns, bloody gore, raw language and other accessories. The plot was a bit planned at the beginning but messed up in the end. Apart from all these, the movie simply rides the top with the help of a new fresh Milla Jovovich.Well, when you place Ms. former Joan of Arc in a skimpy red party dress with an assault rifle in hand you win half of the battle. But besides Milla is lucky to have a fine character on which the director offered much more attention than the story itself. And indeed she is good in such roles. And she was well assisted by good background soundtrack and camera angles. And a provocative ending too, allowing the viewers to dream whatever they can for Resident Evil 2.In all, the movie is actually nothing. You go just to watch Milla. and considering that I'm giving it no more than ***.","

Jovovich carries the film with an ineffable movie-star presence; I feel like she never got her shot outside of this franchise. Dog monsters, laser hallways, blockbuster twists, genuine scares...is this the best video game adaptation ever?","

I'm not familiar with the games, but as far as I know, this was pretty faithful to them. There was, however this one major problem that kept me from liking it. The CGI was simply terrible! I'm sorry, but while the practical effects were fairly nice to look at, a lot of this movie was just plain ugly! Now, I know that it's not meant to be Shakespeare. It does seem a lot like a video game.I appreciate it when people are loyal to the fanbase. The pacing is this film is kind of on and off. It gets a bit too fast into it, but then again, a lot of the film is well put together. I actually do feel for some of these characters even though I'm not familiar with the games. I also like how this does set up a story that is used for more movies, even if they're not that great of a product. It probably helps that I'm into zombies. While I found it to be okay, the creators definitely tried. **1/2","

"xrellerx","16 August 2002","Video game makers are mostly influenced by classic stories to give their games shape.  So, it's no wonder that RESIDENT EVIL has lots of hints to and ideas taken from for example Romero's DAY OF THE DEAD.  I would even dare to mention that there wouldn't be a RESIDENT EVIL if Romero didn't make his zombie trilogy!  But also new films are recognized in some scenes, like for example the scene with the lazer beams is totally taken from THE CUBE (which was pretty good by the way). RE has a bit more action over the whole line, but doesn't have the psychology that goes on in Romero films, neither does it create a tension or a feel with the characters.  It also doesn't have the gore that zombie films supposed to have.  The effects are smooth, yet there's not much blood spilled for a zombie flick.  Best example from this is the first scene in the elevator: we don't see her head fall off. Through the whole movie you are waiting for something to come, they try to build up tension and you are left behind with nothing. The plot (thank you Romero) tries to be high-tech, but it's obvious it's just dragged into the film for little reason, but to give us a falls feeling of intelligent action. RESIDENT EVIL was a total let down and was even worse then I expected.  And then I'm not even talking about the killer bunny...--- FOR GAMERS ONLY ---","

The reviews made this sound like an awful movie, but the truth is it's one of the better movies of 2002 [so far]. There's tons of great action sequences, lots of horror, and for this type of movie, there were surprisingly good performances from Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, and Eric Mabius.

"jdring2007","22 October 2021","I'll start off by saying that, while I am very familiar with the video game series, I'm no diehard fan. That said, I do recognize the sort of ""treason"" in play, making a movie adaptation and featuring not a single character from the games. Instead they go with a fabricated character, Alice, and from the second movie spawn this whole clone-with-magic-powers story arc. Before all of that, however, was this - ground zero. There are still homages to the first 2 games, some more obvious than others, but as a straightforward zombie action flick, it satisfies. Plus, I gotta say, especially as a teenager when I first ""fell in love with"" this flick, the characters - cliche and averagely acted as they are - each have very entertaining moments. Michelle Rodriguez and James Purefoy were favorites, although I've come to love Milla Jovovich too, who in this installment exercises her versatility in playing a helpless civilian to a major badass, all without being too over the top as the sequels were. Plus the ""evolving"" Licker, a great enemy from the games, was incorporated very well in my opinion, teasing it throughout until its final revelation, a delightful mix of practical effects and CGI. No, thisovie is far from the ideal video game adaptation, but hey, it was fun for me as an action flick with some charisma.","

"kannibalcorpsegrinder","30 September 2015","Sent in to discover the cause of a communication mishap, a woman and a commando team discover a chemical weapons facility testing a deadly virus has turned the staff into ravenous zombies and must find a way out alive.This was quite an enjoyable if slightly flawed adaptation. Among the better qualities on display here is the rather impressive bureaucratic stranglehold on display that truly gives this a great feel for what kind of obstacles to overcome. The systems here are quite fun to overcome in the house' security offers a rather intriguing start here that goes along quite nicely with the system underground providing plenty of thrilling times here with the laser grids, control panels, supercomputers and high-tech containment units give this an effective base along the way to string the action off of. Those are quite fun here with this one providing this with its best features from the different encounters here really making for a thrilling time as the first encounter in the storage rooms where not only is the team overrun on all sides but the ineffectual methods to deal with them cause some explosive action with the swarm closing in around them as they fire away fruitlessly before escaping, a fantastic scene of the group escaping into the tunnels swarming with the undead through the sewer with them and leads into the frantic escape through the central station crawling with zombies all around them. This one also goes for some great action featuring the mutants as well with the scenes of the security office with the mutant dogs or a rather impressive brawl with a monstrous licker on-board their transport train so there's some rather nice diversity amongst the action within here. As well as the great-looking gore and zombie make-up here, these issues make this one enjoyable enough to hold off the few problems in here. The biggest issue in this one is the fact that this one makes a rather curious decision to knock off most of the rescue team in the house before getting to the zombies held on the lower levels. While this here does allow the film some gore while off the defenses quite nicely, the fact that these scenes take kills away from the zombies and creatures later on does seem a little unfair to feature here so that there's hardly any time here to survive to get attacked with such a small group of targets left. This really could've been solved easily by either eliminating the number killed off there in the site or have bigger team sent in initially and it solves that easily. As well, there's the fact that it plays a little too loose with the rules of infection by showing several who are turned quickly while others who are bitten repeatedly take forever to turn simply due to storyline needs despite the continuous bites meaning it should've occurred even quicker than it did previously. These, along with some shoddy CGI at times, does hold this one back somewhat.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.","

And seeing as most video game to movie adaptions are utter complete crap, I wasn't expecting too much from this movie. This movie grabbed my attention from the first frame and held it to the very end. I know what you're thinking....""Resident Evil a '10'?"" Let me tell why this is is so well done. The games mostly focus on a company doing genetic experiments and create zombies. Mayhem ensues. The movie starts out telling you a little about the corporation. Not too much to make it a drawn-out scene, but to give enough to know what is going on. Anderson then makes a seamless transition from the intro right into the lab. The opening scene is done so well, without using a lot of dialogue and letting the music build up the tension. The score really makes the movie. A different score would have made this just another zombie flick, but Manson does his best work to date. (And I'm a big Manson fan who owns all his albums. I am eagerly awaiting his next release after hearing the Resident Evil theme.) The score starts with an ominous sound, followed by a creepy keyboard intro and a simple driving bass riff. As the song progresses, more and more tension builds as drums, guitar and the other sounds are added. This song is short, but works so well with the opening sequence in establishing the tone of the movie. Gothic, haunting and creepy all at the same time. Now about the other fronts. This isn't on the same level as some other movies. It isn't a brilliantly written script. The subject matter isn't very intellectual, but rather primal and savage. When making the judgment, you have to view the movie for what it is. A fun, gore-filled thrill ride. The actors don't do anything oscar-worthy, but they do portray their characters well. The make-up work IS oscar-worthy. While its not on the same level as something like Lord of the Rings, it is still quite amazing in its own right when seeing how many zombies they have to create. I would say the film is well-directed, seeing as the director did make an enthralling movie that kept me glued to my seat for the entire time. I don't think I've been so brought into the world of the film then with this movie. I also jumped at a few parts, which is doesn't happen often. This also has one of the best endings I've seen in a movie. So far, this is hands down the best horror movie I've seen in 2002, one of the best movies of 2002 and one of my favorite movies of the horror genre. I'd place right next to Night of the Living Dead, the other masterpiece. In fact, you could almost call this a modern version of the 1968 classic. Now, for the poor reviewers I have this to say. You probably didn't like this just because Romero didn't direct it. And while I consider Night a classic, I hated the other 2 movies in the Dead trilogy. And you can't say the movie didn't capture the spirit of the game. If anything, it captured it all to well. As with all movies, there are those who love and those who hate. My advice? Give this a try expecting nothing and just watch and enjoy the movie. You'll thank me later.","

"lukem-52760","3 August 2018","This first film in the Resident Evil franchise came out in 2002 & i couldn't wait to see it at the cinema & i did & it was EXCELLENT!!! I loved this John Carpenter inspired survival Horror, infact if John Carpenter made a zombie film this would be it & that's a huge compliment.I saw this at the cinema & it was a fun time watching this survival Horror film & probably the most fun I've had watching a film at the cinema!!!It felt like this movie was made for me as at the time i was obsessed with Zombie films & i couldn't wait to see this & it didn't disappoint at all, infact it was even more enjoyable & entertaining & exciting that i could've imagined!!!Every time i revisit this film I'm reminded just how damn good it REALLY is & if I'm the only one who likes it this much i don't care as it's definitely a personal favourite of mine & one of my all time favourite films.I have big love & big Nostalgia for this Action zombie film as it was the first ever ""Zombie"" film i saw at the cinema & that's a big deal to me as i grew up obsessed with Zombie films such as George Romero's Dead Trilogy & the Evil Dead Trilogy, i honestly loved ""Resident Evil"" it's a nice budget take on those old school zombie films with a nice dose of ""John Carpenter"" mixed in so how could i not love this?The production design is excellent within the Hive & the first zombie encounter is done so well with suspense,Horror & action as we have our mixed group of Commandos & survivors having to work together to get out alive, i love that ensemble lgroup dynamic of different characters teamed up, great fun.A couple of good standout characters other than the main stars, were British actor Colin Salmon who plays the leader of the group of Commandos & his big tall frame & deep commanding voice adds alot to the very creepy beginning scenes, his character is not around long but he makes such an intense presence on screen that i would've loved him to have been a main lead!!! Also the computer expert/soldier ""Kaplan"" is good played by another British actor Martin Crewes, a good solid cast with everyone involved actually.Some of the imagery is the best I've ever seen in a zombie film & the design & look is incredible like the underground Access tunnels scene with the dripping water & grimy walls & old pipes that are heroes have to crawl accross that's an incredibly exciting & intense sequence as is the iconic laser hallway scene & the test subjects tanks scene when we first meet a zombie & the atmosphere is so raw & full of dread with it's dark smoky look & then hearing a metal being dragged accross the floor noise it's a zombie dragging an axe, just some of the greatest suspenseful moments in a zombie film I've ever seen, this movie doesn't get the recognition it so deserves & yes the other films in the franchise are not very good & don't come no where near the level of brilliance & quality here so this one 2002 movie that started it all should be considered a ""Cult Classic"" & it's definitely the best movie made by Paul Anderson.""RESIDENT EVIL"" is ridiculously underrated & yet it's more exciting than most huge budget films at the cinema now!!! To me it's a zombie masterpiece that could easily fit into the universe of the legendary ""John Carpenter"" it's got a primal raw survival tone & cold high-tech & artificial intelligence feel to it when our team enter the scary ""Hive"" underground lab base, i feel that contract of old & new here like i did with ""Escape from New York"" & the violent bloody rawness of old school zombie flicks like ""Dawn of the Dead"" for example, there's alot of quality in this film to ignore & i love it.The music score at the beginning sets the tone, it's a creepy digital score that sounds like a ""Carpenter"" inspired 80s synth score, it's really well done & one of my favourite music scores ever as it's so creepy.The cast was great especially Milla Jovovich & Michelle Rodriquez both are great actors & are both fantastic tough ladies of Action in this film, obviously ""Alice"" (Jovovich) is the heart of the movie & is on a mission to uncover the truth about herself & what's happening & ""Rain"" (Rodriguez) is a no nonsense tough as hell soldier & she will stop at nothing to get her job done. Great performances.The rest of the team are all good in their roles basically Marine types & the zombies look great with excellent FX especially the big Licker monster!!!The underground lab where the zombie outbreak starts is a really creepy setting for a zombie movie & the whole idea of a group of marines having to sneak in & shut it down is very exciting with a great sense of dread atmosphere, one of the best scenes in the movie is the terrifying laser corridor sequence, it's a scary scene & we lose most of the soldiers in that Corridor before we even get to the zombies!!!Resident Evil is definitely one of my personal favourite Zombie films of all time, i put this in my top 5 along with ""Dawn of the Dead 1978"" ""Day of the Dead 1985"" ""28 Days Later"" & ""Night of the Living Dead 1990"" all Excellent Zombie films!!!There's a great mix of cold Technical cybernetic futuristic surroundings, with the underground Hive base, & old fashioned bloody flesh-Eating zombie carnage, it's this mix of Sci-fi & Horror that makes Resident Evil very exciting,edgy & Awesome.There's an icey-cold scary atmosphere within ""The Hive"" as the corridors are empty & silent & at any moment our survivors could turn a corner into wondering zombies, it's enclosed & claustrophobic trapped setting reminded me definitely of the legendary ""Carpenter"" in it's look,mood & style.I love this movie & it's mix of exciting action scenes & moody creepy Horror & dark futuristic sci-fi setting, a stunning mix done perfectly.A BRILLIANT & scary ending.A great sci-fi action Horror Thriller & EASILY the best of the whole franchise & really the only great movie of the LOT!!!Yeah good suspense & very exciting Action make RESIDENT EVIL a great film & one of the best Zombie flicks out there!!! Definitely an underrated CLASSIC in my opinion & one hell of a fun ride & a great popcorn flick too!!!The most fun zombie flick ever.Apocalypse is a fun sequel.","

"hu675","6 June 2008","An attractive woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich) woke up from the running shower, after being mysterious knocked-out by it. At first, she doesn't seem to remember anything and including her name. Then a group of professional trained commandos (Lead by Colin Solmon) breaks from the large mansion, she lives in. Including an mysterious cop (Eric Mabuis) is forced to go Alice and the soldiers break in an mysterious underground laboratory called The Hive by the Umbrella Coporation from the mansion. Which the corporation are involved with medical supply, computer technology and others but they are also involved with illegal experimentation. Which the team has also find another man (James Purefoy), who also lost his memory. Earlier on that day, an mysterious virus is been unleashed by killing many innocent people and it sealed the working area by an high-tech intelligence computer called The Red Queen (Voiced by Micheala Dicker). Once the team has turned off The Red Queen, the room were sealed turned open... and the dead has died from the virus returned to live by attack the group for warm human flesh. The illegal experiment from Umbrella turned loose as well. But Alice and the others has to escape before the underground laboratory closed itself and becomes trapped underground.Written and Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (AVP Alien Vs Predator, Event Horizon, Mortal Kombat) made an enjoyable horror film that mixes science-fiction and action quite well. Anderson gets an decent cast here, some of the performances from the actors are good. Although Anderson's writing script is quiet heavy at times and it doesn't always work (Especially the monster ""Licker"" could have used more work in the CGI department) but Anderson knows how to set up action sequences and moments of visual style are always been his best at film-making. This survival horror flick is based on a hugely popular game from Capcom and ""Resident Evil"" is one the best video game adaptations so far.In the Resurrected Edition on the DVD, ""Resident Evil"" is placed double feature with the sequel ""Resident Evil:Apocalyspe"" on a two disc set. DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an terrific Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. It has bonus features on the second disc but it's mostly on the sequel than the first feature. If you loved this film, you could find 2002 Special Edition DVD or the Deluxe Edition from 2004 with additional special features. ""Resident Evil"" wasn't an huge success at the box office but it did well in Overseas and especially with DVD Sales was enough to produced the sequels ""Apocalyspe"" and ""Extinction"". Die Hard fans of the video game and especially those who loved Zombie movies will get an kick out of this movie. Don't miss it. Good music score by Marco Beltrami (Scream Trilogy, Hellboy, 3:10 to Yuma ""2007"") and heavy metal rock singer:Marilyn Manson. (****/*****).","

"itamarscomix","24 May 2005","This film was, I'm sorry, *really* bad. I just can't see a point to it. In the game, all you do is walk around and shoot zombies; the film is exactly the same. There's just a bunch of guys walking around and killing zombies, and occasionally the zombies kill one of them. Every single moment of the film is a hundred percent predictable, so the 'plot twists' are obvious and the scary parts are simply not scary. The acting is horrible, Marilyn Manson's soundtrack is exactly what you might expect, the directing, plot and dialogue are non-existent.Well, I don't know... Maybe it would be scarier to watch on a big screen in a darkened theater, but to me today's horror directors simply got it wrong. You don't make a movie scary by showing lots of blood and organs and people with no eyes or no jaws. A truly scary movie is created by ATMOSPHERE (note Hitchkok and Kubrick). Seeing a guy being sliced into a hundred little pieces isn't scary, it's repulsive. There IS a difference, you know. Two thumbs down.","

"KineticSeoul","11 September 2010","Now this doesn't have almost nothing to do with the video games it tries to adapt with. Besides the evil corporation, the same virus and zombies, it does how ever have the survival horror feel to it and has sort of the similar atmosphere as the video games. Now this film is a mess for the most part, especially the last hour of it, but it's still a entertaining mess and the pacing is well done although it seems to skip a lot of parts and scenes. The story is passable, not great though alright for a video game adaptation and although not particularly scary it has decent action scenes and zombie killings. The plot is basically about a girl named Alice who worked for the Umbrella Corporation, who gets amnesia from a chemical and gets dragged in and has to team up with a group of commandos that is trying to infiltrate a underground lab called The Hive in order to turn off the super computer called the The Red Queen that killed off the workers after a virus outbreak. But the team is in for more than they bargained for. The acting in this is pretty bad, not terrible however. And although it isn't a fantastic film, it still is entertainment to some degree. Would have been better if it had some of the video game elements of solving puzzles with more flare to it and was compact better in a way it flowed better. Has a lot of flaws and nothing about it is scary in anyway, but still decent.7/10","

"tributarystu","22 October 2002","Over one year passed since I first heard that the movie was being made and I've been waiting for it since then. Time passed once again after it was premiered, but I still didn't get to see it...until this oh-so happy day. And what do I have to say? 'twas a satisfactory experience. Terror of the undead is a pretty usual theme for horror movies. You've got Romero's groundbreaking Night, Day and Yawn...sorry, I meant Dawn. This, though, is the first horror movie that started from a game, the popular Resident Evil series. It seems to be a profitable deal to ""inspire"" yourself from games, but there is this other thing too. What do Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy and Resident Evil actually point out? The same that a number after a movie does: lack of imagination. A bit more 'obsessive' in the gaming world, but still very present in the cinematic affair as well. I am not against these ""inspired"" movies. As long as they're good, that is. Resident Evil, directed by Paul Anderson, nearly throws up the following storyline: In a top-secret underground facility a deadly (and terribly contaminating) virus is set free. The computer (Red Queen) closes all exists to the outside world, and all the employees (who till recently had worked for the Umbrella Corporation) are killed. But, actually, as you may imagine, they are not quite...dead.Umbrella sends a special agents team to clear up the mess, and set things as straight as possible. This team will actually be shattered in the underground laboratory by what they find there. The stench of death everywhere. Milla Jovovich is the leading actress in the movie - solid reason for avid movie goers to see this one- and she plays the role of a security agent, who works for Umbrella. Incidentally, she suffers a memory loss after she inhales a protection gas released by the Red Queen. We get to find out in the movie who she really is and what she was going to do.Michelle Rodriguez, Mr. Purefoy & company all get together to do their acting tricks and they do them as well as they could've given the film. Now, as all fans of the RE series will say, this film totally sucked. I nearly subscribe. Only 'nearly' because it wasn't the excremental waste the second movie is (I was so naive in thinking it couldn't get any worse). Also, had there not been some very sloppy distribution of zombie actors and had Anderson at least been careful enough to do the simple things right, technically and chronologically speaking, then RE could've stood a chance. All Anderson does is fit in some cool moves, some cool zombie dogs, while leaving the rest of the film to rot. I consider his attitude extremely disgusting: why make a movie called Resident Evil if you don't want it to have anything to do with the game? (yeah, I know, money...it's meant to be rhetorical) It's as simple as this: the film doesn't do justice to the games. So even if RE can be a reasonably satisfactory sit-through, I am absolutely against what Anderson has done to the franchise, which simply wasn't his to ruin.","

"info-11400","25 February 2007","This is an almost perfect horror movie. It starts with cast, that works great. Even though killed pretty soon, at least most of the cast, each person gives a convincing performance. And that is exactly the ""overall-feel"" about the movie. The pieces - actors, storyline, filming - fit together. It IS a stupid monster movie, it is NOT like the game, but everybody takes the project serious. But it is in no way a great piece of art. Resident Evil is a solid movie, and good at this, no more! Nothing new, except for the scene with the zombie dogs. Ain't that beautiful. It is a new idea for the genre, it's visual fun. Simply cool.","

"jtindahouse","6 January 2017","I was never really into video games growing up, and I'm still not today. So a series like 'Resident Evil' just completely passed over my radar. With the 'Final Chapter' coming out shortly though I decided to go back and review the series to see what I think of it. Going back 14 years when it comes to a CGI heavy film can be a dodgy thing to do. Admittedly, there is a noticeable difference compared to the quality being produced today, but it's certainly not distractingly bad. I quite like films that are set in a confined space with the characters having to either work their way to the centre, or find a way out. This is one of those films and most aspects of it are done fairly well. The one element (that happened to be probably the biggest of them all sadly) that didn't work was the zombies. Zombies are simply not scary, not visually impressive and not entertaining. They're still better than vampires, but they are not a strong thing to have as a heavy component of your film. Having never played the game I can't confirm how close this is in terms of being true to it. I suspect though that it's pretty close. A lot of scenes feel like they're straight from a game and you can even imagine yourself having to pass the level that the characters are currently on. Milla Jovovich plays the lead role well, but I hope in the sequels she evolves a lot. At times in this one she felt like just another member of the squad, and certainly not the main character. People to this day say are still waiting for a great video game adaption to come out. 'Resident Evil' is a solid film, but it's certainly far from being great.","

"mrosesteed","27 July 2019","The first in a decade-and-a-half-long film series inspired by the 1996 Capcom video game of the same name, Resident Evil transforms its source material from gothic survival horror to modern action-horror, complete with prominent electronic music, stock action characters, and CGI violence. Although the movie's uninspired shock sounds, dated computer graphics, choppy flashbacks, and stereotypical casting foreshadow the weaknesses of its vastly inferior sequels, Resident Evil benefits from a solid mystery plot, detailed art direction, and a charismatic performance by Milla Jovovich as a mordern, grown up Alice in Wonderland. The result is a fun thriller whose lack of graphic violence does not dampen the horror of the Umbrella Corporation's cavalier attitude toward human life.","

"BigGuy","15 March 2002","First of all, I want to say that I have never played resident evil or even seen it played, so I have no idea about accuracy to the game, etc.  That being said I will review it as a movie only.This movie is incredibly tense.  Throughout the entire movie I kept waiting for the next jolt/scare, knowing it was coming and still getting startled. The plot proved vaguely interesting, but was largely lost in the carnage. And of course since this is a sci-fi horror the ending left open the possibility of Resident Evil 2.The acting was on par for a horror scifi movie.  Basically the cast was Michelle Rodriguez, Milla Jovovitch and a bunch of guys no one cares about except that they (in some cases) advance the plot.  Milla did a fine job playing the beautiful but tough security agent with amnesia and something to hide.  Michelle played a thug, an annoying thug (as per her usual endeavors).  Both actresses have their pseudo-trademark scenes.  For Milla this means being nearly naked except for, to quote James Bond, A nice nothing she is almost wearing.  For Michelle it is the sweaty hair in the face snarl look.All in all it was better than most game turned movies and about on the same level with other movies of the genre.","

"amesmonde","6 June 2002","An amnesiac heroine (Alice) and a band of commandos attempt to contain an outbreak at a secret underground facility where the virus has caused the dead to come back to life.It's a surprisingly great Zombie film. Past Zombie flicks have contained a lot of bad acting with low budgets and story lines that weren't that great. Whle I can't draw comparisons of the adaptation into the film Paul Anderson does a great job of creating an empty eerie atmosphere. While some of the CGI effects are an unnecessary distraction the make up and costume design is first-rate. There's an intelligent story and great script. The stunts are fantastic notably the dog attack and the supporting cast are great and the two strong female leads Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez are excellent. The music is hard hitting, foreboding which adds to the action and creepy moments. A good chunk of flesh eating entertainment-a great update and revival of zombie movies which pays homage to George A.Romero.","

After nearly 20 years I couldn't remember a damn thing about it, so I had the joy of watching it for the ""first"" time all over again. It has intrigue, suspense, terror, action and mystery. I was prepared for a fun, silly, early 2000's cheesy action movie and was surprised to find much more than that.
The only thing that loses it for me is the very dated cgi. You lose the terror in those scenes. Every time they cut back to practical effects it's much better.","

Yet, few know, or would want to know the cost which many paid to have such a world kept secret. Now, Writer and Director Paul Anderson, has unleashed a film called "" Resident Evil "" which exists hundreds of feet below ground. There, a top secret science laboratory and a fantastic computer called ' The Red Queen ' hums perfectly, until one day it corrupts itself and releases a monstrous air-borne virus through out the maze-like multi-level complex called 'The Hive' causing immediate changes among the employees. Jason Isaacs narrates how the incredible computer become a danger to the world. Now a crack military unit, led by their team leader, Ames Shade, or 'One' (Colin Salmon) is summoned to destroy her. Inside the private quarters, a scientist named Alice (Milla Jovovich) awakens and cannot recall who or even what she is. Other civilians like Spence Parks (James Purefoy), Matt Addison (Eric Mabius) along with Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez) and Martin Crewes (Chad Kaplan) are all at the mercy of the Red Queen as the diabolical machine tries to kill them. Everywhere around them, mutant humans and ravenous dogs await their attempt to escape. From beginning to end, the movie demonstrates how fear can be generated from the terror-fill environment. Excitement is everywhere and one never knows just who is there to help or to hinder their progress. What can be concluded is that once you're in the Hive, chances are you will not leave . . . alive!

"TwistedContent","4 January 2021","One day I sat and thought it could be nice re-watching some of the horror franchises real proper like, and all six ""Resident Evil"" installments happen to be somewhere far back in the viewing history. Having played a couple parts a little, I'm not well-versed in the gaming lore of ""Resident Evil"", so I won't talk much about those angles. Can't say I was a big fan of the films back then, but let's see the perception now. As the unforgettable Marilyn Manson's theme instrumental sets in, I'm cozy and ready.
Very quickly we get introduced to world's largest commercial entity, the Umbrella Corporation, their huge secret lab dubbed ""The Hive"", laying under Raccoon City, and the genetic experiments they carry on down there, as well as the T-virus. A yet unknown figure sabotages the operation and releases the virus, causing a rogue AI to shut off the hive and trap everyone inside. A special military unit gets sent in, on the way picking Milla Jovovich with a pretty bad memory lass. She is none other than Alice, as she'll reaffirm that to us for the rest of the franchise.In the essence, ""Resident Evil"" is a familiar story with some cheese and plenty of cliché characters, but it is happily aware of that. A horror survival story, made less routine with over-stylized action sequences, maddening editing, injection of humor by the good cast of characters, and the ever-beautiful femme fatale Milla Jovovich, for the most part in just a couple layers of clothes, of course. Acting is good throughout the film, and besides the main attractions, dames Milla and Michelle, props from me to Martin Crewes portraying the poor team's tech guy Kaplan. Kaplan had the most stressful jobs... The story uses same old blueprint tropes, and ends in seemingly the only way it every could've, apocalyptically more hopeless and setting up a sequel.Though I haven't yet re-watched the sequels, I doubt anything is going to change the fact that this is the most horror part of the franchise, the one that feels to justify the genre the most, because it's not only blowing zombie brains on rock music waves that makes horror. ""Resident Evil"" is the most atmospheric of the franchise, and I believe a role in that plays the sets - all underground, having a little long-term claustrophobic effect, as well as color grading, it's all red, white, black, silver, more red... Cold tones. Having said all this, psychological dread is not something this film possesses. ""Resident Evil"" is a decent horror movie that could've been a great one. A complaint with little weight, but the outdated ccgi didn't help, though there are also practical effects at play.In many ways of style, ""Resident Evil"" embodies a lot of what was high on top during the early 2000's, from the set and costume design to (outdated) FX, to industrial music, to the overall tone. If you're a fan of such vibes, zombies, Milla or the games, check it out! Though I don't find it likely You haven't already. My rating: 6/10.","

"RavenGlamDVDCollector","15 August 2016","Okay, I do not play video games, being RavenGlamDVDCollector takes up too much time to fool around with other stuff as well, and my interests are 100% glamour-driven. Also, I originally, way back in 2007, had a multitude of choice, and decided to give RESIDENT EVIL and ULTRAVIOLET and BLOODRAYNE a miss, they'd be blood and gore fests, judging by the posters in the video store. Recently, I obtained UNDERWORLD's first three, and then there was the trailer of ULTRAVIOLET, which surprised me, I was hooked, that I had to see. Okay, I have since learned that people do not go for ULTRAVIOLET, that it is a rip-off, and, yeah, as good as that trailer is, it also became immediately clear to me that there is a lot of fakery, a lot of cartoonish stuff, I mean, look at the trailer, it's great, but cannot hide that there might be problems...... Tp cut a long story a bit shorter, I could only obtain ULTRAVIOLET as part of a two-disc deal, the other movie being RESIDENT EVIL, so, a couple of days ago, I watched the big gore fest. Ooh boy, it was only the week before that I saw THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE with those mandrill creatures attacking, and this week it was mutated Dobermanns on the rampage.I've been a fan of Milla Jovovich ever since she was a child star in TWO MOON JUNCTION way back in the previous century, yes, I am that old! Then, a few years later, she was in RETURN TO THE BLUE LAGOON, and that one sure had its moments. Time has treated her well, I see, quite a few years later, she is still this stunning long- legged beauty with this amazingly aquiline face. She is ultra-feminine, prime quality Ukranian export. The movie itself has a cumbersome slow start, but eventually the action is astounding, the producers had gone all out to provide the creepiest ugliness you can hope to find on film. It's just, I wouldn't really call it scary, it's not really suspenseful, it happens too blatantly in the open, it doesn't come unexpectedly, that's what I mean. But the mutated dog scene, that is something, when you hear that dog coming on, tip, tip, tip, claws on steel, and the first sight... hoo, horrible.I'd give them an A for effort, but I have to point out that the movie takes a very long time to establish itself. Once it gets going, it lifts off, but you can't shake the feeling that it could have been done a whole lot better. Certainly Milla Jovovich (hey, and the commentary finally taught me how to pronounce her name!) is the ideal choice. Really, that is the only thing I am sure about re this movie. Some of the male leads are kinda blah! but I'm not going into that right now. And Michelle Rodriguez is one tough ol' bird, hey?A weak point of this very violent movie is the unrealistic portrayal of dismemberment. A pinprick causes blood, people, you know that. So what does it mean when on-screen HUMAN characters, not undead characters, get chopped up, but not a drop of blood? Well, d-uh, it means the producers we're trying to appease the American Motion Picture Association by cutting down on what would have earned them a more stringent rating. But if a character doesn't bleed, it was undead too... Something everybody forgot. Major goof.In closing, this Milla Jovovich fan is quite satisfied. She's great, movie is not too bad, not as good as she is, though.Grrr-aarghhh!","

"lastliberal","21 September 2007","I am sure that this would have been a much better film had George Romero (Night of the Living Dead) signed on, but I don't take anything away from Paul W.S. Anderson, who did a good job despite lack of experience with zombies.I did a double feature last night to prepare for the third film in this series. No, I haven't done video games since Pacman, so I had no idea what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed Milla Jovovich and, of course, am always happy to see Michelle Rodriguez.I have only come into zombies recently, so I was not aware that this film brought the genre back after a long absence. It is to be praised and revered for that, if nothing else.Now, in the next film, I hope there is a little more zombie and less sci-fi.","

"ivo-cobra8","9 October 2016","Resident Evil (2002) is my favorite horror sci-fi action flick that is based on a video game and it is my second favorite film from Paul W. S. Anderson! It is favorite horror sci-fi action flick of mine and I love this film to death! By far one of the best horror films ever made! Milla Jovovich is a sexy actress and plays a perfect role for this movie. For 2002 the special effects are amazing and the acting was great. Definitely the best out of the three. I Wouldn't Say Its A Horror Movie, Yet I'm Not Saying Its Not. This (Along With Underworld, Van Helsing and More) Is a strange combination of Horror, Action, & Sci-Fi. If someone asked me what genre It is I would probably say Horror. Horror is supposed to scare you. This makes you say ""Holy Crap This Is Cool."" either way awesome movie. Plot: Alice (Milla Jovovich), a young woman who along with fellow survivors must find a way to escape a underground bio facility that is infested with zombies. The film would launch the Resident Evil film series. Something rotten is brewing beneath the industrial mecca known as Raccoon City. Unknown to its millions of residents, a huge underground bio engineering facility known as The Hive has accidentally unleashed the deadly and mutating T-virus, killing all of its employees. To contain the leak, the governing supercomputer, Red Queen, has sealed all entrances and exits. Now a team of highly-trained super commandos including Rain (Michelle Rodriguez - The Fast and the Furious, Girlfight), Alice (Milla Jovovich - The Fifth Element) and Matt (Eric Mabius - Cruel Intentions) must race to penetrate The Hive in order to isolate the T-virus before it overwhelms humanity. To do so, they must get past the Red Queen's deadly defenses, face the flesh-eating undead employees, fight killer mutant dogs and battle The Licker, a genetically mutated savage beast whose strength increases with each of its slain victims.""...Mila Jovovich is a first-rate action heroine.""This film has everything it is a zombie movie, about plague a deadly T-virus that infected its employees and turned them in to a bloody thirsty eating human zombies! It has deadly booby traps, killer mutant dogs, the Licker mutant zombie. The action is great, the horror in this movie is visually scary. Michelle Rodriguez from The Fast and the Furious is excellent I love her character Rain Ocampo she was a tough special forces commando soldier in this flick. But Mila Jovovich is a bad ass, she is so hot and sexy I am kind of jealous on Paul W.S. Anderson for having so sexy and beautiful heroine for his wife. I love this flick and I love the songs in this movie. We have Eric Mabius from The Crow: Salvation I love the songs for this movie: My Plague (New Abuse Mix) - by Slipknot and Invisible Wounds (Dark Bodies) by Fear Factory. The movie itself is very good, it's a zombie flick but as some others have stated, not retarded or boring, it's actually a great movie with not a lot that I need to complain about, good characters, action sequences, story, game-references, dialogue, suspense, etc....I don't think I need to say too much there.Overall: I am going to give this movie a 10 out of 10, this is the best one in the series and no sequel can overpass the original. What else can one say about the Resident Evil franchise: as far as basing a movie off of a video game, Resident Evil has to be one of the best adaptations ever. It keeps the broad strokes of the game intact while creating a new character, Alice, that everyone can instantly identify with. Milla Jovovich takes the action hero foundation she laid in The Fifth Element and builds on it to make herself perhaps the first female action superstar. I love this film to death and it is my favorite film in the franchise it is still a true horror film! Resident Evil is a 2002 science fiction action horror film written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson. The film stars Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez. It is the first installment in the Resident Evil film series, which is loosely based on the Capcom survival horror video game series Resident Evil.10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Screen Gems Constantin Film Starring: Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, Martin Crewes, Colin Salmon Director: Paul W.

"tequila101","12 May 2012","I watched this film a few weeks ago, and I must say, I was really impressed with how this film turned out. It is truly a different look on the horror genre, in a future like style, where characters, villains and the plot itself act very different. I think that RE is one of those good ol' modern horrors which should be given a chance and for good reason.The plot is not looked upon much, and it is very simple. A virus takes over the world, once a contamination is unleashed by a corrupt corporation. Survivorsw team up to survive. Sure simple enough, with not much ground covered, but what makes RE excellent is the action, the character development, the horrific kills, the technical/futuristic music and the theme of it all.I believe all of that stuff is done quite well and it so happens that it can become quite creepy with the dogs.Although RE isn't an award-winning film, it sure has some intense action and scary scenes to keep the viewer looking at the screen as well as pumping out the blood, gore and entertainment.My Verdict is that it is the best in the series (although I do like the rest so far). 8/10","

"acedj","13 January 2020","Deep under the ground of Raccoon City lies the hive, a secret facility run by the evil Umbrella Corporation. A secret bio-weapon known as the T-Virus is set free, turning everyone that dies into a zombie. This is a fantastic take on the game, though it barely resembles it. Instead of the title characters, we get Alice, who is far more bad-ass that Leon or Claire or Chris ever thought of being.
I really loved this movie and the series that followed it, though some were stronger entries than others. This is a fast paced, creepy and at times funny movie that is a must see for any fan of the zombie genre.","

"Backlash007","25 August 2002","~Spoiler~Resident Evil, when you get down to it, is a well-crafted piece of horror. It's my favorite scary movie to come out of theaters in a long while, no teenie-bopper s**t here, just pure horror.  The atmosphere and infectious score are second to none.  I love the small glimpse we get of the mansion, with the blowing leaves and evil crows.  It's also very claustrophobic at times and those are often the best horror films.  Paul Anderson's direction is perfect and he succeeds in doing justice to the video game.  The opening of the film is so tense (the elevator scene especially) I had to remind myself to breathe.  There were some other scenes where I just wanted to jump in and start whippin' some zombie tale.  The dog's were incredible and the train sequence was straight out of Resident Evil 2.  The in-joke was also great (""Where'd all the bodies go?"").  Upon viewing the trailer, the fight scenes looked very anime-esque.  I didn't think it was going to work. However, the flipping kicks and snapping necks make Resident Evil quite original.  It is easily comparable to a few other films though (but I'm not upset about this fact).  First off is the hallway scene with the lasers. Someone watched Cube before designing that sequence.  And then there's the bigger comparison:  Aliens.  Both films share basically the same plot, with a strong female lead, but who cares.   The only things that don't sit right with me are the all-too-obvious CG Licker and the character of Kaplan; after all the crap he suffered through, that poor guy deserved to live.  Those things don't take too much away from the film however.  Resident Evil is an exceptional addition to the zombie genre and a great theater experience (I have not had an adrenaline rush like this since seeing Event Horizon, another Anderson classic). Can't wait for a sequel.Note for genre buffs:  The newspaper at the end of the film reading ""The Dead Walk!"" is an obvious reference to George A. Romero's classic Day of the Dead.  Also, Jason Isaacs (Event Horizon) has a great cameo in the film.","

"Simonster","25 February 2002","This has to be the best zombie-mutant-shoot-'em-up-splatter-film I've seen in years! It rocks, it rolls, it's lock and load entertainment of the finest kind! And certainly not for the faint of heart or even weak of stomach!Not having played the game, I can't comment on the film's accuracy. But Resident Evil, unlike previous attempts to transfer video games to the big screen, is a great action film in its own right.The plot is very simple: A team of elite commandos is sent into an underground laboratory to find out what caused the death of several thousand employees. Of course, an evil corporation has been evilly getting up to evil tricks and nasty things are lurking in dark corners.Now forget the plot and fasten your seat belts as the elite team is not only taken apart by some cool special effects but also finds itself on the menu as hors d'oeurvres, entrée and dessert for a horde of ravening zombies, mutated Dobermanns with attitude and a giant...thingy!Writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson pulls out all the stops as the countdown ticks down and the bodycount steadily mounts. There are moments that will make you jump and your pulse race, gunfire aplenty, loads of narrow escapes and some great ""Oh ****!"" moments; all to a pounding rock beat.There's more than enough blood and guts shown, figuratively as well as on the floors, walls and ceiling, to satisfy all but the sickest of individuals (Hi Susi!) and full credit goes to the prosthetics, make-up and special effects departments.Milla Jovovich makes an excellent kick-zombie heroine (and I for one, would volunteer to have my neck snapped like a dry twig between her thighs anytime!) as does Michelle Rodriguez as one of the troopers.Resident Evil is everything Tomb Raider should have been and wasn't. If you've lost faith in ever seeing a video game successfully make it to the big screen, you will believe again. If you won't see this film because it's based on a video game, you will be missing out in a big way. Overcome your prejudices, I did, and finally get your money's worth from a trip to the cinema.Producer Bernd Eichinger's Constantin Film has recently had its name attached to some very dubious offerings (All the Queens Men, for example, or 666-Trau keinem mit wem du schläfst - trust me, you do not want to know!). But with Resident Evil the company is well and truly back on top of the game.Now where's the sequel??!!","

"springsunnywinter","8 May 2007","I am a huge fan of the video game series; I've played & completed almost every Resident Evil game there is. When the film was announced I thought it was going to be rubbish because mostly films that are based on games are completely crap especially the ones made by Uwe Boll, but I still went to see it the first day when it came out in the UK and it was sooooo amazing. I was speechless after I seen the film, the story is truly original and one of the best thing about it is that the first 10 minutes was slow & peaceful but then it went really fast & relentless just like a roller-coaster going up slowly & zoomed down. Paul W. S. Anderson has proved that he is terrific writer & director because it is extremely difficult to create a story for a film that is based on a video game. Milla Jovovich was undoubtedly the best and I loved her red dress to bits, it definitely did suit her. Watching the film gives you a deep insight of the game e.g.When they had about 3 hours limited time to complete their mission.Every time they enter a new place it had to be checked and they had to make sure it's safe just like in every game.If they where trapped they had to find another way out.In the end Alice & Matt got out without killing all the zombies because Resident Evil is rather a puzzle game and killing is not necessary.The combination of action, horror & thriller is superb; they are my entire favourite genre. It had a lot of style and the use of advanced modern technology that is mostly I look for in a film, the Licker in the end was the icing on the cake. This is the only movie that I liked with zombies in it because most of them are stupid & boring especially House of the Dead, the zombies pop out of nowhere and attack people. In Resident Evil the creation of zombies was very sensible, the staff of the underground laboratory were infected by the T-Virus released into the air vent, after getting killed by the Red Queen to avoid any outside interference their dead bodies were reanimated. It is mentioned very clearly that why they ""need to feed"", nothing like that has ever been in any film which makes the story original. Dialogues are also good my most favourite quote is ""You're all going to die down here"" from the Red Queen, she is one of the best characters along with Alice, Matt & Rain. Background music score is the best music possibly for any film I have ever heard it has heavy metal guitar for the fight scenes and very soft, eerie & sensational for the main title. I have the soundtrack CD and I bought it just for the background score without caring that the other tracks might be good or not but it did turn out to good. There is nothing more I can ask for in a film that makes it one of my all time favourite movies and there is never going to be another film based on a video game like this!","

"SnoopyStyle","10 March 2014","The Umbrella corporation dominates the world. In an accident at its secret underground facility called ""The Hive"", a dangerous virus is let loose. It has infected the staff turning them into zombies while mutant creatures run free. The computer Red Queen shuts down the complex and kills everybody inside. Alice (Milla Jovovich) finds herself with amnesia in a house that has a secret entrance to the underground labs. The corporation sends in an elite armed squad (Colin Salmon, Michelle Rodriguez) who finds amnesic Alice and Spence (James Purefoy), and they go in to investigate.Based on the video game, director/writer Paul W.S. Anderson brings some interesting gore into the movie. The characters are two dimensional. But it does what it intends to do and not much more. It's mostly atmosphere in the first half. Then there is shoot them up horror action but nothing terribly scary. And hot Jovovich doing battle with zombies and mutants. The flashbacks as Alice remembers is distracting and usually disrupts the flow. The video game genre doesn't usually get much better.","

"page79","31 July 2002","I was very disappointed with this film. Paul Anderson has directedsome great films. I loved Mortal Combat. Thought Event Horizonwas a fantastic film ,(except the ending. I hate it when the explaineverything, better to let the audience come to there ownconclusions.) and was thrilled with Soldier. All of these film I begyou to watch! This one however, ..second to all of the above. I dontreally blame Anderson. I think the material he had to work with is abit dull. Flesh eating zombies was a cool idea ONCE. Continuallyhitting that dead horse(no pun intended) has become very boringfor the viewers. Anderson managed to get all you can fromJovovich. The other actors fell under the old Star Trek philosophy,(If you aint seen 'em before, there going to die, has anyone elseEVER seen these people in ANYTHING?) so I guess flushing outthere characters would of been a waste of time. All and all Resident Evil was just a 90 minute lead in to the sequel. I've got my fingers crossed that Anderson can write and directhimself out of this corner and provide his fans with a reason to seehis next non-Resident Evil film.","

"ghostofdaniel","22 June 2004","The logic of a ""zombie movie"" is not to have a good plot, but to have lot of gore. Like a porno : who cares the script since we watch sex ? But, if we have no sex  and no interesting plot, it's really boring.The plot : A virus transforms deads in zombies. The computer says ""These zombies must eat !"" . But it doesn't say why they must eat human flesh. And zombies can't eat each other, they need to eat the flesh of the living. So our heroes must fight against them. Ho, I forgot : a monster chases them and he mutates when he eats ""fresh DNA"" (lol). So, as you see, a very intelligent science plot. (Sorry not to have mentioned ""SPOILERS"", you'll miss the pleasure to discover this beautiful and unpredictable story).
Let's see now the fun gore : as the movie begins, when the first gore scene is missed (the girl in the elevator), I knew this puritan style will spoil the only good thing of this movie. And I was right ! How many ""let's look elsewhere"" to avoid a bad scene. ""A zombie must be shot in the head"" ? Yeah... but in Romero's movies, the head explodes, in this one, there is just a little red spot on the front. It's ridiculous !Apparently, the director wanted to make an horror movie for the little kids.So, Okay, if you are a little kid, run to watch this movie ! Otherwise, return to watch ""Dawn of the dead"" which knows what gore means.4/10","

Spectacular , action-packed and thrilling first installment of the ¨Resident Evil series¨ , adapted from the video games characters produced by Hiroyuki Kobayashi . Yet another noisy film rendered from a video game which never gets as eerie as a Zombie picture should . Unstopped-action gore-feast that provides for high-octane escapist entertainment with some eye-catching visuals and pulsing soundtrack . This exciting picture contains thrills , chills , action-filled with fierce combats and lots of gore and guts . The horror and action moments are fast moving and compactly realized , being the first movie of the series not to feature undead dogs . This original takes more , more approach , more fights , more blood and gore than subsequent sequels . The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely fantastic to the bizarre along with scary and amazing frames . It's predictable but we have seen some scenes in previous films , but also its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic acting from the action-women , as Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez . Milla Jovovich did all of her own stunts except the pipe jump in the sewer scene . The main actors were told to prepare for the film by getting copies of the games and playing them through. Some of them didn't know if they could complete them in time so they had to get video copies of other people beating the games and then watch it . One of the most popular scenes in the film - when Alice runs up a wall and flings round to kick a zombie dog in the head - took 3 months of training for Milla Jovovich. The flesh-eating mutants appearance deliver the goods , plenty of screams , shocks and tension . The make-up assistants create a truly horrible zombie cannibals and state-of-art FX won the Canadian Screen Award for Achievement in Visual Effects . Professional dancers were cast as zombies . Horrifying and astonishing images about apocalyptic events with destroyed city , with a technological facility totally inhabited by flesh-munchies creatures and much of it was filmed in unfinished stations of Berlin underground . Cool , luminous cinematography using Steadicam by David Johnson . Haunting , pulsing Techno-musical score by Marco Beltrani . The motion picture was professionally directed with startling visual style , though with no originality , by Paul W Anderson . This was he second movie based on a video game directed by Paul W.S. Anderson , the first was Mortal Kombat (1995). Its successful opening weekend sparked a frenzy among US studios, eager to capitalize on the interest in video games. Titles like Doom (1993), Silent Hill (1999) and Max Payne (2001) were all snapped up. The complete saga is formed by the following films : ¨Resident evil¨ by Paul W Anderson with Milla , Eric Mabius , Michelle Rodriguez , James Purefoy , Colin Salmon ; this is the best , dealing with a group of containment specialists are sent in and have to fight employees who have been contaminated , while A.I. computer instigates a series of defensive measures to contain the virus .

"Jack the Ripper1888","17 April 2002","This is the best zombie movie that I've seen since NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1990). And that was twelve years ago now. This movie really delivers the goods. Explosive action sequences, gory zombie kills and some brief unneccesary nudity.*SPOILERS* This is a typical zombie movie. People go in to rescue dying people. Rescue people get trapped. Zombies start attacking them. But yet you wonder where they were when they first got in? This is about the only flaw that I can pick out in this movie. RESIDENT EVIL is a non-stop action horror thriller from start to finish. I never thought we would see Milla Jovovich in a role like this. Not after she did THE MESSENGER: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC. I thought that after that she would stick to nicey nice movies. But its a good thing she didn't. This movie wouldn't have been the same without her. And maybe its also a good thing that Romera decided not to direct after all. Because his zombie movies are so shallow. You could dive right in and crack your skull. The characters used bad dialouge in his films, language in every sentence (for no reason) and all his characters ever do is get attacked in the same stupid ways. Paul Anderson changed all that. What we have is a build-up to the suspense. We don't just immediately jump right into the zombies eating people. We slowly get to that part. I give RESIDENT EVIL 5/5.","

I did enjoy the movie but it did not feel like it was Resident Evil. More like a sci fi horror film with some nods to the game.I knew already it wasn't gonna be the most faithful adaption going in to it, but at least add some of what made the game famous. And the stuff they did add, such as the dogs and licker was well done. The zombie 's were pretty good but they were not terrifying at all. The build up until you see the first zombie was really well done.The soundtrack was very good and I enjoyed that tremendously. Milla Jovovich was pretty good as Alice. I just wish they made it somewhat more faithful to the game. It would not have been too hard to adapt the first game into a movie. It would have been more terrifying then what we got","

"Aussie Stud","17 March 2002","Okay, so ""RESIDENT EVIL"" wasn't up there in the high ranks with films like ""ALIENS"" and ""DAWN OF THE DEAD"", but it still gave me a reasonable amount of scares that I haven't experienced since the late 1980's.Primarily based on the successful video games, ""RESIDENT EVIL"" is a brooding piece of work that builds up suspense and horror in a claustrophobic-like atmosphere where a group of soldiers and two guards must infiltrate the headquarters known as 'the Hive' of a high-tech operation known as 'the Umbrella Organization' to shut down a mainframe computer that is known as 'the Queen Bee'. Little do they know that all 500 employees working in the Hive are now dead and have been re-animated as zombies while all other creatures inside have mutated into horrifying monsters.It appears that someone broke into the laboratories to steal a heavily-guarded experiment known as ""The T-Virus"" which has the ability to re-animate the dead. When the virus is stolen, the culprit throws one of the test-tubes containing the virus onto the floor which shatters, resulting the Hive in shutting itself down and trapping everybody inside the underground complex.Milla Jovovich is one of the guards who was supposed to protect the Hive. She is found in an outpost with severe memory loss of her identity and occupation. She along with the group of soldiers and one more guard are taken deep into the Hive. When all Hell breaks loose after the zombies and monsters are unleashed, you will be taken on an unforgettable thrill ride that will leave you riveted to your seat!Most of the praise for this movie lies within the special effects. I enjoyed seeing the zombified dogs and the creatures inside the huge metal containers. The only thing I was a little disappointed with were the zombies themselves. I am very serious when it comes to my zombies, so I was very excited to see the ones featured in this movie. When one man is attacked by a swarm of zombies and is basically eaten alive, I expected to see some good shots of limbs being torn off or flesh being eaten. Instead you only get to see a few of the zombies 'pretending' to bite into him as he screams, and later when he himself has been re-animated as one of the undead, the only signs of his demise are a few bite marks and some trickles of blood running down his face. Other than that, it appears as if the zombies didn't even bite into him at all! A few other scenes also display the same issue - one including a moment where a man is killed after a mutant beast 'eats' him, yet when looking closer at his body in a later part of the film when he too becomes one of the 'undead', he also appears not to have been injured greatly either. One might think that they originally died from fright!One small minor problem I had with the movie was the lack of characters left to 'survive' a sequel. The ending was fantastic - a deserted city scape left in ruin and pandemonium by something horrific, a door left open for a future sequel.I hope they make a sequel. I remember when ""STARSHIP TROOPERS"" came out and all actors involved had signed on for a trilogy, yet it performed very poorly at the box office meaning no sequels would be made. I don't care if ""RESIDENT EVIL"" only makes $1.00 in its opening weekend, I want to see a sequel!My Rating - 8 stars out of 10!","

The action then starts in a lab where an unknown thief steals a case containing a biological weapon that we later learn is called the T-Virus. As he fleas he smashes one of the vials releasing the virus into the facility, known as The Hive. As the virus is spread through the air-conditioning The Hive's computer seals the facility and kills everybody inside. We then cut to the sight of a naked woman, Alice, wrapped in a shower curtain; she gets dressed and is surprised first by an unknown man then by a whole squad of commandos! Their leader addresses her as 'Soldier' but she has no idea who she is. The other man identifies himself as a newly transferred police officer. These two are then taken by an underground railway to The Hive where we learn they intend to shut down the computer, known as Red Queen. Red Queen's defences kill many of the commandos and before the others shut it down its avatar informs them that they will all die. It soon becomes apparent that the people in The Hive have come back to life as zombies! Perhaps Red Queen was right; certainly many of them won't make it; some of them will become zombies themselves and not all of the dangers are outside the group.I have not played the computer games this film was inspired by so can't say how the story compares but it didn't feel like there was much unexplained within the film. The fact that Alice has no memory means that we are told everything we need to know as the leader of the commandos tells her. The film opens strongly with the scenes with Red Queen killing everybody in The Hive and after we have been introduced to Alice and her situation the action is pretty good. It is also varied; we have Red Queen's futuristic defences that literally slice and dice some commandos with a laser, hordes of zombies, zombie guard dogs and a mutant creature for our protagonists to battle against. While nobody is going to be winning any Oscars for this the cast do a decent enough job; Milla Jovovich is good as Alice; putting in some good action scenes and Michelle Rodriguez is fun as the hard-core commando Rain Ocampo and Colin Salmon adds some class as the commandos' leader although sadly he doesn't last too long. In many ways this film feels like 'Aliens' with the aliens replaced by zombies; we have an evil corporation, one of the group who is working against their interests and the fact that the protagonist and the toughest soldier are both women... I guess if one is going to borrow ideas from another film one could do a lot worse that take from 'Aliens'. The effects are fairly mixed; the zombies, both human and canine, are impressive but some of the CGI is far too obvious. The Red Queen is delightfully creepy due to the fact that it speaks with the voice of a young girl and prior to shutdown appears to be all-seeing. Overall this film is far from perfect but it is surprisingly fun in a fairly trashy way.","

"JohnBoyRoy","22 March 2004","For anyone who has played throught the videogames in the series (especially the GameCube remakes) will know that it was the immense tension, slow build up, film noir-like lighting and the gritty characterisations that made the zombie action so brilliantly scary.However, it seems that Paul 'Mortal Kombat' WS Anderson spent his time watching Kerrang! on cable in the run up to over seeing the design of the film.  Resident Evil, although catering mainly for the 'teen - rockers' faternity could also have appealed to a broader horror fan, or even been a more mainstream sucess (in the same way that 'The Others' was 'Poltergeist' for thesps).The entire thing plays like a two hour rock video.  Why is the installation so clean and new?  It was housed in  a rotting mansion in the games (with its decrepid grounds and gothic architecture) and merely placing a mansion in the film does not a plot point make.The zombies had CGI eczema and the amount of cast was OTT - why not have a few specific deaths instead of popcorn cannon fodder?  The music was terrible - just because it is horror and was made in the new millenium we had to put up with thrash metal. Hmmm.Paul's sequel will be just as crap, im sure.  God, I hated this film, as I'm sure you can tell - and you will too if you're a fan of serious and genuinely frightening horror.  This is just a media franchise film I'm afraid, and very unsatisfying.I gave it a 4 just because it had a vague resemblance to the game, but the potential that the game held, cinematically, has been devoured by this actually very poor film.This style was great in 'Mortal Kombat' - it was a good, fun, meaningless film (like the game) but in the case of 'Resident Evil', a narrative that holds deep emotioal and social meaning (and is subtly scary) it is as useful as a spoon.","

"uds3","15 May 2002","If movies are all about entertainment, this is one of the most successful films in history! The best action-fest I've come up against since ALIENS, to which it owes more than a nod!Absolutely the best video-game to movie transfer yet made. If it bears but a passing resemblance to the game itself, well who the hell cares? The simplistic plot is ideal for those with limited attention spans. The underground corporation-run sub-city experimental lab is thrown into disarray when a virus forces the ""Hive's"" CPU to shut down prematurely. A lot of people die most graphically. Another ALIENS type elite commando team (complete with an APONE look-alike) are sent in to ""rescue"" Milla Jovovich who for a while has no idea what the hell she is doing there, plus whomsoever they can rescue before they hope to kick-start the central computer who is playing some really innovative and rogue games with both the intruders and the audience.Mutant victims with more than a touch of the ""Living Dead"" cannibalise their rescuers one by one. Jovovich in easily her best role to date (are those the sexiest lips in screen history or what?) high kicks her oppressors and unbelievably well digitised Doberman reconstructs with flair and accuracy. There is simply no let-up throughout the movie which with the decibal screaming Dolby sound and rock-soundtrack just all dovetails together seamlessly.  State of the art FX enhance this adrenaline-pumping scifi caper and propel it into the stratosphere.As good a horror/sci-fi/zombie flick as you are ever likely to see with one all time mother of a jaw-snapping monster yet devised. Makes the Alien Queen look like a sedated kitten!This is one mad movie with a kick-ass direction and totally awesome action sequencing! Check out the dicing-death by laser-grid! This was mega-cool! I went straight back into the theater and watched it at the next session!","

"simpeton","30 July 2002","The two main things about this movie that bothered me the most are as follows:1:  They never established a sense of utter hopelessness.  In any Zombie flick this is the key.  Zombies are dumb, clumsy, and slow.  The only way to make them a true threat is to have your heroes in as small and unescapable place as possible, and to have HORDES of zombies for miles and miles as far as the eye can see.  It has to seem hopeless. While it was clear from the start that at least 2/3 of the supposedly highly trained paramilitary team was expendable, at no time was Milla Jovavich in any danger.  There are scenes in this movie where five or six soldiers are being swarmed by Zombies, and despite all their training and vast weaponry, they can do little.  Then Ms. Jovavich, in her ripped up nightgown and with no weapons at all, drops in on them and goes Bruce Lee for three minutes, and, there ya go, no more Zombie threat. BULL!!2.  While they did seem to spend a decent amount on the special effects for the zombies, the main Mutated Beast that comes at them in the end looked like something Ray Harryhausen might have done for one of his movies in the 60's.  Which is not a slight to Mr. Harryhausen at all.  Clash of the Titans and Jason and the Argonauts are two of my favorites, and a documentary on Mr. Harryhausen put me in awe of his talents. But the claymation-like movements of the Mutant in this movie really clashed with all the rest of the high tech goings on.All in all, if you want a decent Zombie movie, go rent ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""Zombie"", an unnoficial Italian sequel that came out before Mr. Romero came out with ""Dawn of the Dead"".  If you go with ""Resident Evil"", you will regret it before you finish the movie.","

"mr_pivac1985","11 March 2003","During the primary literary phase of its development as an entertainment form, the gothic genre tended to involve a set of familiar ingredients - ruined buildings, virtuous heroines in distress, supernatural manifestations, heroic rescuers and loathsome villains, perhaps with a gang of bandits thrown in. Even though we call 'Gothic' simply 'Horror' these days, and even though most of us now visit this genre in its new home of the cinema more than on the pages of books, these ingredients have hardly changed over the years. Resident Evil is fascinating proof of this on two levels.On the most obvious level, for Ruined Building read The Hive - the abandoned but not-so abandoned biowarfare lab which is the principal location of this film. For virtuous heroine read Milla Jovovich wearing a dress as short as her legs are long; for supernatural manifestations. well, it's a zombie film. You get the point.On the second level, this film is a bit of an abandoned ruin itself, haunted by the wailing spirit of the film it might have been. You can see how the crumbling architecture might have formed a magnificent structure at one time - however, what separates this from every other romantic ruin you will ever visit, is simply that most ruins come to their tragic state of disrepair thanks to the gnawing of time's teeth, or violent misuse, and not simply because the owner got some cowboy in to build it in the first place.More of a folly than a ruin, then. Sometimes this film looks beautiful - the cameraman certainly knows how to present the lead actress in a favourable manner - I'm not sure Jovovich has looked quite so luminous on screen before. A pity, then, that the film is so awful taken as a whole.This is a film without sense, restraint, inspiration, or even excitement. It's not a good zombie film, not a good action film, and not a good science fiction film. It has an extraordinary trompe l'oeil quality that does, at times, deceive the viewer into thinking the film has some genuine quality - but it is deception only.What's more, it strikes me as rather bizarre that a film about zombies, with such obvious possible influences and precedents, should come across as being more interested in aping James Cameron than George Romero. Indeed, it is somewhat pointless since it is neither the first Aliens-wannabe, nor anything like the best-equipped to carry out such imitation; and this supposes that imitating another (perfectly good) film is even a good idea in the first place.The utterly pointless directorial allusion to Psycho which opens the film is entirely typical of the direction; so, like a jackdaw's nest, this film may contain many shiny and interesting things but it is simply a mess. Unlike a jackdaw's nest it isn't constructed of old twigs or covered in guano, nor has it fallen down a chimney into a fire yet - but we can always hope.I suppose utlimately what I find most objectionable about this exercise, and what makes me dislike it more than many other more obviously terrible films is that watching it you can actually see what a good film this could have been. This film earns contempt not so much for its mediocrity as for its wasted potential.I would have LOVED to see G.A. Romero make a comeback with a ""Resident Evil"" movie: zombies are his territory and he would have been able to pull some depth to it. Everything would have clicked, sure hit.10/10 If I could give it more I would.","

"Paragon240","30 July 2022","The first of a 6-movie series, Resident Evil stays grounded in its horror roots more than the rest. This movie takes every opportunity to keep the audience tense and on edge with zombies, monsters, deadly lasers, and jump scares. When most video game adaptations result in embarrassing movies that should have gone straight to streaming, Resident Evil put together a solid storyline with great action, fun characters, gross zombies, and entertaining horror.","

The effects are a little sketchy, but the acting and story are good. It is a lot of fun to watch.I think the fight scenes are too quickly cut for me to understand exactly what is going on, but some of them, such as the dog battle, are very well done. I like the acting, especially the lead.I recommend this one.","

"kirk-246","23 July 2009","'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is my favorite movie in the series.If I had a chance to see the 4th film, which was animated, then I would probably like it better since it got a good score on IMDb.But anyway, I can't say that the first was as good as the second, but it still is a nice piece of film.Fans of zombie movies and video games shouldn't be disappointed.What can a person not like about this film? Sure, it may not be as good as 'Dawn of the Dead', but it's still a zombie movie, and a good one too.What the movie really needed was some gore.There was a little blood, but I love to see a movie with people being torn apart by zombies.Lucky for me, the 3rd film managed to fix that problem.Bottom line: 'Resident Evil' is a good zombie film with a terrific performance by Mila Jovovich.The sequels are better, in my opinion.","

"bullions27","25 October 2002","SPOILERS... After a year since I last saw this mockery of film-making, I figured maybe a second-viewing would help me tolerate this film. That had to be the second biggest mistake of my life next to agreeing to go see Wing Commander. The mistakes and flaws in the film were made that much more obvious with a second-viewing I nearly had to gouge my eyes out in spite of its sheer medicority and utter ridiculousness.I tried to like this film... it was, after all, based on the cheesy video game from Japan that had some pretty good moments. I guess it was too much of a task to have both actors and a script in a movie even though Anderson has made some horrible films with some decent acting (Event Horizon) or cheesy acting with a pretty good film (Mortal Kombat). Resident Evil has neither. The plot is generic, and serves only as an excuse to develop a senseless sequel, have Milla pose half-nude (to appease the RE fans I figure) and have plenty of zombies go ballistic. With some stretch of the imagination this COULD be tolerable and FUN but there are two very glaring mistakes in the film that stand out like a leper in a crowd:1) Their choice of Actors - Cheesy, screwed up action films have only 2 saviors, excellent action sequences (to some degree), and at least average acting. Brotherhood of the Wolf, as ridiculous of a story as it was, had very decent acting and incredibly well-done sequences and cinematography. Resident Evil, with its silly storyline, had characters with the uncanny power to read their lines off script cards. Impressive. Can they act that horribly, or did they put effort into it? The leader of this ragtag bunch of soldiers was pretty cool. He could deliver all of his lines in monotone and display one facial expression. Needless to say, he was killed off quick. In fact, nearly all of the useless soldiers were killed off quickly (just like John Carpenter's Vampires) which I guess was a plus for Anderson. Michelle Rodriguez, playing in vain as the Vasquez-hack of Aliens (more about this later), tops him by emoting one emotion along with her delivery of lines in monotone. Sad, she was wasted in this film. A myriad of other characters share this same profile, including the dear Milla who can kill zombies with martial arts even though an entire clip of a MP5 will do nothing. By the way, why was she trained to do this? She could kick some serious behind for no explicable reason yet her partner/husband (this was never explained either) had none of the training? I assume all of this was discarded to ensure the people will return for the explanation in the sequel. At the other end of the spectrum, we also have Eric Mabius, who could display two emotions... slightly confused, and very confused. You know I've read the early drafts to this heinous monstrosity and he annoyingly keeps adding about how the suspense of this movie will freak you. Sorry, buddy, your whole crew of actors actually made us laugh more.2) Hacking other movies - I can point out at least a half dozen different scenes where Anderson (who loves to recycle other people's work) pulls from Aliens. These aren't subtle attempts, or clever renditions. I'm assuming his thought process was like this:Anderson: Wow, I just thought up of a cool and gruesome way to kill off all of my useless actors! What can I do to make it ""suspenseful"" and filled with ""tension"".Anderson's Brain: How about watching the movie Aliens and copy the scene where the marines were attacked for the first time?Anderson: Good idea! Let's see, I'll take the Hive, the Queen, and even the Aliens popping out of nowhere and snatching people. I could even recycle the lines without changing them! I am a GENIUS!Pretty pathetic, and I'm not even going to bother pointing out the stupidity of some of the plot elements or the other movies it borrows heavily from (like Odyssey). By the way, if this T-Virus was so powerful we are led to believe, why does it take a millennia for it to take effect on a live person? All in all, I couldn't find a single shred of entertainment in this. Why would I? If you took a recipe for Chicken with sauce diable and you thought it'd be neat to recycle it and throw in tang and peanut butter, it's not going to taste any good.3/10","

"Patchbunny","20 March 2002","I recently read a first draft for this movie by George Romero, and I can't understand why they discarded what he put together.  A much better script, with a genuine sense of drama and hopelessness.  Probably why they didn't use it.Now, I have never played the game (and that should not be a requirement. If it is, you need to hire another writer) so I cannot say if it's true to the game or not.  But then I don't really care if it does or not.  I'm interested in what sort of movie the studio produced.  Is it scary?  Can folks act?  Does it make sense?  Is the ending a standard movie cliche? Resident Evil fails on all these points.I won't bother going into the errors with their bio-toxin lab.  (If you can't figure out on your own that the lab would NOT run off the same air ducts as the rest of the facility, then you won't understand the rest of the movie's problems.  Go watch Ghosts of Mars and brace yourself for the surprise ending you'll never ever see coming.  Honest.)  The scene continuity is terrible.  Folks are surrounded by zombies with no way out, then next scene they're safely out of the way.  What happened?  How'd they get out?  Guess Paul Anderson wrote himself into a corner.  Frankly, he does that a lot.  Getting in and out of the lab appears so darn easy you have to wonder why they didn't send in the janitor to reboot the system while he's mopping the floor.The biggest hole is why the computer simply didn't TELL someone that the virus had escaped, why this is a Very Bad Thing.  But since there's an antidote, it's not really that bad, is it?  How about shutting down the facility entrances, notifying folks in charge, and then giving them a shout of the green stuff before you go killing everyone?  Must be a software error.  Darn that Windows 2000!Aren't we all getting tired of spotting the survivors when the movie starts? Could we at least have someone else survive for a change?  Would really be so difficult to not film the ending of `Guess what-it's not over yet!  Bet you didn't see THAT coming!'  Umm, yes, we did.  About an hour ago.  It's such a standard ending now you'd think they teach it to film students.Not much to see here, and very little to get excited about.  Standard pulp fare for the masses.","

"JG2001","19 March 2002","More and more, studios are turning popular video game titles into movies. Unfortunately, more often than not, these films tend to turn out between mediocre and awful. The one film that rose above the norm in my opinion was Final Fantasy, which, despite its shortcomings, still provided some wonderful entertainment.Resident Evil is much like Final Fantasy in that respect. For one thing, it never pretends to be anything more than it is, a film based on a video game that already has a B-movie plotline. Naturally, it's not going to win any academy awards, but Paul Anderson managed to make a film that should leave most viewers satisfied as long as they aren't too condescending in their opinion.The action sequences are energetic, which is an accomplishment when you consider that the vast majority of the monsters in the film shuffle along at about two miles an hour. Some of the scenes with the zombies massed together resembled a literal mosh pit of the damned.While the film doesn't contain any characters from the video games, it's obvious that Anderson did his homework when he wrote the script. The movie functions well as a prequel and to my knowledge doesn't contradict plotline of the games. In many respects, the movie was tailored a bit more to the fans of the games than the general viewing public. Perfectly setting up room for a sequel, fans may yet get a chance to see some of the game series's heroes in living color. It certainly deserves a sequel more than Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, in any case.To sum up, while Resident Evil is most certainly a popcorn flick, that doesn't necessarily make it a bad film. It has its entertaining moments, and if it's given the benefit of the doubt, it has its rewards as well.","

"tedg","9 September 2002","Spoilers herein.Video gaming is bigger business than movies! But movies innovate and create society where games borrow from and reflect elements of society. So its quite an interesting challenge in putting together a film project on a video game.First: you cannot, must not innovate. To emulate a video game you have to aggressively steal from other projects. You have to exclusively rely on stereotypes. That's because games have to have a passive imagination in the world: you have to not think about what it is or how it is put together so you can focus on the problem at hand. Films are all about creating a world in such a way that the registration of that world is the whole point; it should be engaging work.So here we have borrowing from `Alice in Wonderland,' `2001,' the zombie films, the Alien films and on and on.It is about fighting the building like so many haunted house films (and `Cube'). It is also about fighting zombies. No, you have to fight an alien creature (sexy girl losing her military companions). No, that's not right, you have to fight the selfinterested supercomputer. Oops, the real threat is doublecrossed conspiracy. Wrong again: the battle is the `the man.' Another twist: none of that matters since some combination of all the above has destroyed Toronto.This could have been really, really cool. It could even have been fun as we are buffeted among all these different types of films, each a discrete genre in itself. But no one involved has a smidgin of cleverness. Just one art director would have made all the difference. All we get is a map of the hive that doesn't correlate.Obviously, all the bucks were put on Milla. But she is as dumb as they come, so what you really need is someone who can photograph her well. She knows how to relate to that. But watch closely: no one did during regular filming. The studio went into remedial mode so added a lot of closeups that are distributed throughout. These are photographed with a fashion magazine sensibility with entirely different makeup and lighting than the surrounding scenes. Gives us good face, but sort of chops things up. That is to say: this was not done in the style of `Fifth Element' and `Joan' which was made by someone who knew how to photograph a face amidst action and who was smitten by that face.Maybe next time some better talent will be brought in.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.","

"zardoz-13","15 October 2016","""Mortal Combat"" director Paul W.S. Anderson's first entry in the ""Resident Evil"" franchise is basically a low-budget zombie munch-fest based on the popular Capcom video game that spawned the series. This $ 30-million horror chiller relies on several narrative devices to fuel its adrenalin-laced antics. First, the heroine suffers from amnesia as she struggles to remember what she was doing in the ultra-secret, high-tech, subterranean laboratory of the Umbrella Corporation where scientists have been conducting research and development on experimental viruses for military usage. Second, from the moment that the rescue team arrives and collects Alice (Milla Jovovich of ""The Fifth Element""), Matt (Eric Mabius of ""Cruel Intentions""), and Spence (James Purefoy of ""Solomon Kane""), they have an hour to penetrate the Hive, carry out their mission, and exit the complex before it seals itself shut. Third, the entire experience occurs in a claustrophobic setting that accentuates the suspense after our heroes encounter a zombie horde. Everybody earning a paycheck in the Hive dies when a traitor smashes a lethal t-virus container that shuts down the facility and winds up spreading death. Fourth, the ravenous undead are not the only adversaries that our heroes must contend with; zombie Dobermanns threaten them as well as a mysteriously mutated monster with a long, elastic tongue and razor-sharp claws that can penetrate a train. Believe it or not, Anderson displays some discretion in some of the greatest gut-churning scenes. When a group is trapped inside an elevator, one woman squeezes her head through an opening and realizes too late as do her companions that she is going to be decapitated when the elevator goes upward and smashes her head. The audience, especially those that have played the Capcom game, know that you have to put a bullet in a zombie's head to kill it. Unfortunately, our stalwart heroes aren't privy to this life-saving information. Eventually, the supercomputer that regulates the Hive and takes the holographic form of an adolescent female becomes another of our heroes' adversaries.As the plot unfolds, Alice regains her memory in bits and pieces and realizes that she was the individual who had decided to expose the Umbrella Corporation. All of the laboratory technicians in the Hive perish tragically through no fault of their own because one mysterious individual sabotaged the Hive. These employees come back to life as zombies that live only to eat. These zombies are traditional ""Night of the Living Dead"" shambling walkers. The close quarters inside the Hive as well as the booby-traps that our heroes must navigate to avoid constitutes a primary form of suspense. At one point, our desperate heroes clamber atop the air condition ducts dangling by wires from the ceiling to escape the zombies milling about beneath them. One of the more memorable scenes takes place before this one when the rescue team arrives in a hallway that has been booby-trapped with the equivalent of a cheese grater made up of lasers to slice up the rescue team as they scramble to avoid them. Our heroine Alice—dressed in a skimpy red dress—contends with hunger Dobermanns in one of the strongest scenes in the film. Just when she thinks that she had taken care of these menacing dogs, she runs into others. Before long, even these canines mutilate undead dogs and attack Milia, but she knows how to contend with them.""Resident Evil"" gets the franchise off to a fitting start when our hero arrives by train.","

Milla Jovovich, in her now-iconic red dress, looks amazing and acts naturally (as opposed to Michelle Rodriguez's forced performance). The film does not have an ending - just a setup for the next chapter. It's well made, with an impressive production design and some moments of effective tension; but it's also very derivative, and the mediocre digital effects may make you nostalgic for the good ol' days of practical gore. Trivia question: how much did that extra who got his neck snapped between Milla's powerful thighs got paid? Because I would have done the part for free....**1/2 out of 4.","

No wonder it spawned so many sequels, it's one of the few which are watchable.That doesn't mean it's a great film. The editing might be its worst quality, with inexplicable slow motion shots and breaks in continuity. The story is as flat as one could get, the focus being mostly on people surviving monsters and killer AIs, without much consideration on how reality works. I especially loved the safety protocols against viruses: slow moving doors, access panels that can be smashed to open the door and infected monsters to stop infected people from leaving?Anyway, it's a fun film. I don't really remember any of the series and I will soon forget the details of this one. My gut feeling is that the films will slowly improve before becoming really stupidly bad, at least Milla will be acting better.","

"Chrysanthepop","2 November 2007","Normally I tend to avoid films like 'Resident Evil' unless when strongly recommended enough to be convinced. I'd watched it when it released because my brother kept insisting, telling me what a great movie it was. I thought it was an okay film with a terrible ending. Tonight my brother played it on the DVD and I watched it again as my family as around and I still feel pretty much the same. Though having the company around didn't make me feel like I had wasted my time and a few points I'd like to make about the film.The background score I found to be very impressive. It's one score I'd like to own. The special effects are not that bad either and the sense of isolation and abandon within the building was quite well done. I liked Milla Jovovich's acting for most parts. I think she displays the range of emotions very effectively through her facial expressions and makes Alice different from a caricature sci-fi horror movie heroine.Now pretty much everything else in 'Resident Evil' ranges from mediocre to bad. There are plenty of ridiculous 'jump' giving moments. Though I didn't jump at all, I saw my cousin startle at some scenes. The zombies are laughable. It's extremely Hollywoodish and the ending, though unpredictable, was disappointing and in my opinion, silly.However, I didn't feel as bad as I did after watching it for the first time. Maybe it's because of the company I was in or maybe I just noticed some of the more positive side of the film (which in my opinion is still limited).Ho","

"PlayerSS","21 January 2003","After going back and watching this a few times. It didn't really have the RE feel. The zombie make-up was bad. It didn't really follow the games at all. Making it seem more like a prequel was bad idea. I would have like to have seen some of the characters from RE 1 the game in this movie. Not the second movie.The main enemy so to speak was all wrong and Anderson should have it been a main enemy from the first game. Milla did OK with what she was given, so did Rodriguez. The ending was decent. It would have been better if the first movie didn't lead into the third game. The sequel seems to be even worse.","

"hauntshow666","4 August 2022","B-movie cheese, A-movie atmosphere, great characters, tight pacing, nice bursts of action, beautiful production design, a literal killer building w/ twisted traps & dang laser corridor? Yes plz.Mansion, lab, commandos, conspiracy, high angles, big monster on a train fight? ✅ It's so weird in retrospect that people hated this for not being a 1-to-1 adaptation of the early games when this really does a great job adapting said vibes?It's an adaptation, it's in the word, you have to *adapt* things for a different medium- and if you just copy/paste the source material there's nothing new, fresh or exciting.But alas, the most annoying Resident Evil fans will never be happy until there's mystery jewels inserted into the eyes of a secret tiger statue and *2* different types of crank puzzles accurately portrayed on film.Sequels aside, this film as a standalone is really something special, and looking back it's a kind of lightning in a bottle that they never quite recaptured.","

"Robert_duder","11 April 2002","Ultimately I had no expectations of this movie. Although the advertisements did catch my attention and I was a huge fan of the original game...I didn't expect greatness or failure from the movie. Originally when they talked George Romero or Sam Raimi as director and the possibility of stars such as Kiefer Sutherland or Bruce Willis starring I will admit I did form some sort of image as to what I thought Resident Evil should. This movie did not come close to what I had in my head...but it didn't matter...I still consider it amazing. The action was top notch and the music was pounding and excellent. It was futuristic (moreso than one would imagine) and the whole story comes together in such a way that you are left very, very satisfied. The characters and actors are excellent and you are definitely left disappointed to see any one of them killed. I would like to have seen more of them survive. Milla Jovovich comes through in a big way as the kick-butt heroine who gets some great dialogue. This movie felt like X-Men in the way that it left you wanting more and it felt like it was only the beginning. I thought the ending to Resident Evil was phenomenal and perfect and I couldn't have wished for a better ending. I hope that Hollywood carries on the grand tradition of milking sequels because I would keep coming back for as many instalments of Resident Evil as they can churn out.","

"lebbercherrie","7 June 2005","I'm a big fan of horror, and I thought I would hate this film, as most adaptations from games tend to be b*llocks, but I found it very good. The story itself is quite meager, but hey, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre wasn't written by Tolstoj either. Action is good to very good, and tension is well kept throughout the film.I'm not easily impressed by overwrought fighting or action scenes (e.g. The Matrix) but the scene in the hallway with the lasers is great.Being fond of Romero's work, it was fun to see the zombies back in action. Especially the zombie-dogs (mutant, zombie, infected, whatever).Don't expect grand insights, moving scenes on the subject of the human mind, or being moved to tears. This one is a roller-coaster, baby, nothing more, nothing less.Hang on and enjoy the ride.","

"adamzad","1 March 2005","to save this pile of rubbish.There is only *one* thing that can be said in favor of this movie: Surprisingly, for the first time in my memory, Milla Jovovich actually looks GOOD. In flicks like The Fifth Element, it never ceased to amaze me the lengths she would go to to make herself look hideous. In this, I didn't even know it was her until I saw the name in the credits here on IMDb. Yowsa. Yummy.Now, about the movie... It's worthless. The ""plot"" is weak, character development is half a step from non-existent, the premise is a rehash of dozens of old zombie movies mixed with the crazed supercomputer taken from dozens of other flicks, the acting is as you would expect from low budget B-Grade horror fare, and the scenery & effects are of the level that could be achieved in my basement with odds and ends I have lying around the house.This is what I will begin calling a ""Time-Machine Movie."" Meaning I wish I had a time machine to go back and recover the 2 hours of my life that I wasted on this schlock. It's too late for me, but you can save yourself from this impressive effort to lower the standards of mediocrity even farther than they already are.","

"Cineanalyst","25 March 2020","""Resident Evil,"" an adaptation of a video game, is a bad movie in essentially every regard: hackneyed, simplistic scenario (evil corporation unleashing zombies), adulteration by association of classic literature in Lewis Carroll's Alice books, rudimentary acting, perfunctory dialogue, loud music for the sake of being loud, inept style, generic action scenes. Despite all of that, this may have been a more enjoyable action flick, at least on a so-bad-it's-good or guilty-pleasure level, if not for some atrociously choppy editing. The quick cuts to get around actors being substituted for stunt doubles or to otherwise conceal the fact that they can't physically do what their characters can is worse than usual. Alice's fight with the dogs is one of the worst examples. Moreover, these flimsy constructions being passed off as action scenes are cobbled together with unmotivated, silly slow-motion shots. There are far too many close-ups of Milla Jovovich's consistently blank expression in lieu of actual dramatic tension, too. All of this is reflected in the soundscape, as well, which is a shambles of bombastic score and clanging metal.The choppy editing is all the more conspicuous because the blueprint of the ""Hive"" occupies a significant space in a scene early on, only for the picture to loose all direction once inside the architecture. One moment, Alice is listening to exposition from some guy whose sister she just re-killed, and the next she's back with the group locked in a room surrounded by zombies. Another moment, Michelle Rodriguez's tough chick (yeah, I know, what a stretch for her, right) is diving for a gun underneath another horde of the walking dead; then, cut, and all of a sudden she's escaped with the rest of the remaining gang from the bitters below. Even some of the CGI is overly choppy, especially when we first see the monster recycled from the ""Alien"" series. As with the stunt work, quick cuts are also meant to conceal deficiencies in the visual effects. Play the score and sound effects loud enough and have Jovovich pose in various states of undress often enough, however, and, perhaps, nobody will notice or care, seems to be the logic here. Yet, worst of all are the movie's equivalent of video-game cut-scenes. With two of the main characters experiencing amnesia, the plot takes several breaks from the action to catch up on the backstory--the sort of poorly-directed bits of dullness that a gamer would likely press a button to skip in a video game so as to get back to killing zombies.I knew there was a reason I had avoided this movie for nearly two decades now. I only came to it now for the references to Carroll's Alice books. Unfortunately, like everything else here, these are trite. Besides a protagonist named ""Alice,"" who awakens from a state of unconsciousness, there's the AI's little girl avatar, and the AI itself is called the ""Red Queen,"" although it really should've been named ""HAL 9000,"" for how much it rips off yet another far better film, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968). ""Resident Evil"" is rubbish. I think I'll continue to pass on the inexplicably-made sequels.","

Predictable, formulaic, but fun.With cool sets, sinister backstory, plenty of gore but not becoming reliant on it, this original Resident Evil could be argued as having rebooted the entire zombie genre. We didn't have any 28 Days/Weeks Later, or George Romero returning to his undead throne yet.Solid action, decent direction and Milla's galactically perfect legs make this a fun romp even nearly 20 years later.","

"vasco_cid","11 September 2002","As common knowledge has it, Resident Evil is based on a computer game from the same name, which, due to its success, and Hollywood's last fashion of bringing to the big screen wether it is computer games or comic-book heroes, Was brought by competent director Paul W.S. Anderson into a gore filled film. As I stated before two probable reasons stand to explain why the computer game was transformed into a movie: First, as Resident Evil was one of the most profitable computer games ever, a movie adaptation wouldn't take very long. Second as lately many computer games (Mortal Combat) or Comic book heroes have a movie adaptation (X Men; Spider Man), Resident Evil - The Movie should be coming any time now. Frankly, I've never played the game before, although I've knowledge of it, which is why I know how the main story goes. Perhaps what is more noticeable is the sense of claustrofobia that not only the actors, but the viewer feel 2km underground. When we get into a movie like this, we already know, we're not going to see some masterpiece, the screenplay will not be something amazingly deep, but one can tell that was never the intention of the producers. Their intention was undoubtfully to suck the viewers in, make them jump, scream, sweat tremble, laugh and become frightned. If that was the intention, congratulations, you made it. Kudos, mainly to the Director. If the intention was some underlined one, like character development or story's depth, they failed. But as the intention was the first one, then Resident Evil, is one of the most enjoyable and job fulfilling movies recently. The cast is not exacly big stars, with the exception of Milla Jovovich, but that doesn't matter all that much because the movie was an enormous success, mainly because of the talent of increasingly rising young stars, like Michelle Rodriguez, James Purefoy and Eric Mabius. Finaly, what probabily shocked people the most was the completely opened end. That doesn't mean anything else than ""sequel next year"". B-movie? Yes. Funny? Sure Enjoying? Definetly! 8 out of 10","

This time the zombies, former technicians and scientists, are underground in a high-tech lab that secretly develops terrifying biochemical weapons of mass destruction.For those who care about the reasons for why things went crazy down there, suffice it to say there was a plot to steal a virus to prove what a horrible place it is - but one of the conspirators preferred to sell the virus to the highest bidder, while killing everyone else (or at least turning them into the Undead). I think that was the explanation! Regardless, a sort of SWAT team is dispatched to shut down the Artificial Intelligence computer that has taken control of ""the hive"" - that name for this huge multi-level subterranean laboratory.The gorgeous Milla Jovovich, never looking better, plays an enigmatic prisoner of the SWAT team suffering from memory loss.

Special effects are very good; the monster-thing being the highlight. Perhaps after all these movies I've become jaded, but I didn't think it was even all that gory. But that may be just me. There is absolutely nothing thought-provoking about this film, which is OK with me (although that was a failing with ""The Time Machine"").

"Carrigon","25 May 2002","I really liked this movie.  I'm usually a horror movie snob and hate anything new.  But this one was very good.  Milla was great, I would love to see her in more roles like this one.  I thought the script stayed very true to alot of the gameplot.  And the movie definitely had some creepy moments. I was very sorry they didn't show more of the mansion, I would have loved to have seen more of it.  It's an amazing property.  And while the makeup wasn't like Tom Savini's work, it was still very good.  When I heard Romero wasn't going to be doing this project, I really was prepared to hate it, but I think Paul Anderson did a wonderful job on it.  And he set up the ending very well for the sequel, which I think will be even better.  If you're a fan of the games, this movie is worth watching.  I was never bored, it kept up a nice pace.","

"ryan_kuhn","13 February 2005","We've had movies based on books, based on the Bible, based comic books, based on songs, and ever since the mid 1990s, movies based on video games. Resident Evil is based on a video game, but probably could have been based on a night of heavy drinking and watching ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Night of the Living Dead,"" one after another. In Resident Evil, an evil bio-research company, called Umbrella Corp, or something silly like that, manufactured a virus that brings the dead back to life and causes them to want to eat other people. The standard horror movie rules apply, if someone is bitten by a zombie, they will become a zombie, zombies can only be killed after certain parameters occur (almost always where something is severed), and the girl with the most revealing dress and the biggest boobs will be the de-facto hero of the film. Milla Jovovich plays Alice who wants to steal the virus to somehow protect the world from it gets caught up in the building where the virus is stored has a security breach, and that causes all heck to break loose. This is where HAL 9000 takes over, errr, rather ""Red Queen"" takes over, as the computer has to shut down the building to make sure the virus does not escape, and will do anything to make sure it doesn't happen. Some computer rebooting occurs, yada yada, and by the end of the film, only 1 or 2 of the people who were in the building at the beginning are alive by the end. The movie is directed by Paul Anderson, who also directed ""Alien vs. Predator,"" so action scenes are to be expected. Some of the action sequences are so dark, so frantically edited, that while the scenes convey ""chaos,"" the message is lost in the inability to figure out what is going on. I would tell you who the men actors were, except they all look alike, so I couldn't tell who was who, they all had the same height, same haircut, one guy wore a blue shirt, but most of the others were even dressed alike. I know there is only one casting list out there anymore, but this is ridiculous. Not the worst film I have ever seen, but after seeing it, I have to wonder why they felt compelled to make a sequel. I for one have not heard about ""Resident Evil Mania"" out there.","

"lingmeister","8 December 2002","Seeing another movie coming from a video game background, and not a gamer at all, I was expecting another lame-o video game adaptation.  So my expectation wasn't very high.  I was surprised at how much better it was. The plot was pretty straight forward, get in, get the job done and get out. But in most aspects of it, it held me at the edge of my seat for much of the movie.Not that it was perfect.  The way the movie is laid out seem to follow a video game's strategy of conquering room by room, save the flashbacks, which slowly revealed the main characters' purpose.  The different level of laser slicer served no purpose except if you are at the joystick yourself (a mechanism in which these people, who knew the ins and outs of the system, didn't know about.)  We don't know how the sister was ever outside the compound.It seems to be a much better version of John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars, which I found to be an absolute bore.","

This mass of people saying that this movie is the best zombie movie ever though, I mean c'mon people! First off, the Evil Dead Trilogy is scarier than this film, and I just saw those 3 movies for the first time last week. Those films were't even supposed to be scary, and had really small budgets, but were 10 times more fun.In response to everyone saying you get to see Milla Jovovich naked...(Sarcasm begins now) OH WOW! I got to see half of Milla's nipple! OH MY GOD! The promised land does exist! Oh please God, just let me see a full nipple one day, and I promise I'll never sin again! (End Sarcasm) Anyway, if I want to see Milla naked, I'm sure she's posed for Playboy or something, and you saw more in the Fifth Element anyway. Plus she was younger and looked a lot better in that film.I hate Michelle Rodriguez. She's not hot in my opinion and she's played pretty much the same role in every movie she's been in. At least most actors who get typecast try to break away. Granted, they usually suck at whatever they try different, but that's not the point. Jim Carrey is a perfect example.By the way, was Milla's character ever mentioned by name in the movie? Or do we all know she was named Alice from this site and the credits. My friends and I could all swear we never heard her name or the black guy who looks like Laurence Fishburne's name. What a sucky script, we can't even get names for the people....Anyways, I think this film sucked, if you think it was cool, then go rent a real zombie movie, or at least find something that's not a Matrix wannabe ( Jump kicking Dog scene, bullet time licker scene)...","

"rmarkd","20 April 2002","I have to admit that I expected to see a movie geared towards a teen crowd not looking to watch a film, but just to see action. While this isn't the most cerebral out there, it's more than I thought it would be.The bad: Well, at times the action does get tedious and convenient. For example, there's a scene where they get trapped in a room. A laser shines down the room at head level. Then it shines again at head level. Then it shines yet again, but this time forming a criss-cross pattern. Now, this laser is a defense mechanism, so why go for the criss-cross pattern right at the beginning? Why mess around? Things like that and some of the dumber, repetitive action scenes can get annoying.The good: I like movies which throw you into a situation where you are in the dark, and that's where this starts off. From a science lab, we see someone break a vial and leave the lab. From there, it switches to a woman in a mansion. No one knows what's going on (including her), and draws in those people wondering what went on (like me). The story is laid out where you don't feel manipulated and there are enough turns in it that you don't get the feeling that you know what's really going to happen. I also have to admit being surprised about the ending, but I liked it. The acting is what you'd expect, and the score fits well with the scenes.
Having not played the game, I can't say how well it takes from the game, but I can say that the movie is accessible for someone who hasn't played the game, and it's worthy of a rental. Bottom Line: It's a good action movie to watch on a Friday night with friends. 7/10 -Mark","

It's created a mood all its own with a futuristic ambiance, a tough but tender lead actress role (Milla Jovovich) and non-stop action, suspense, plot twists and a show of innovative ways to get killed by zombies and in other dangerous situations (don't want to give too much away).For those of us who have played the RE games, this movie provided a nice background, a sort of prequel and more depth to what was going on in the game and the reasons behind it. For anyone who hasn't played the video game, this movie is an excellent stand-alone horror sci-fi flick that is sure to become a classic and that does a good job of keeping your eyes glued to the screen and your heart thumping while you wonder what the poor characters will have to face next.I would give it a 10 in the genre.","

Why would zombies feed on humans instead of on whatever it was they ate when they were still human?Mutation is not the same as shape-shift.Why have a bunch of scrap steel pipe just hanging around a personnel transport except that the director has a plan for that prop later on?

It seemed really cool which it was.I really expected the story to be simple where you too can be brainless like the zombies and still understand what's going on but the storyline is actually thought really well, many scenes shocked me many times, good thing about this movie is you can't really predict what's going to happen next and there are many chilling all of a sudden something popping out every few minutes which keeps you awake and interested at all times.Out of all the game-to-movie adaption, Resident Evil is the best entertaining film, Final Fantasy wasn't too bad but it lacked in similarity with the game and some scenes made me fall asleep and Tomb Raider was just a joke. Resident Evil though, you can watch many times and not get bored. Pure entertainment.I don't think this is much of a spoiler but the ending is similar to the start of Resident Evil 2 the game. Another plus is it uses many ideas from all the Resident Evil series such as the mutated dogs in RE1, the licking creature in RE2. I'm sure it's hard to use ideas from games to a movie which the creators of Final Fantasy didn't do a good job of (where were the chocobo's?!) anyways, even if you haven't played the game at all you MUST see this movie!I think this was a great start to build up to the sequal, if they make a sequal which they must, a lot of people will be craving to see the movie. For you gamers who saw this movie I'm sure the sequal will have Nemesis like in RE3.#1 Game to the big screen movie! Actually the RE1 the game was practically a movie with real people in the game. The game is no doubt one of the best games ever made and this movie is pretty much up there with the horror movies.I would give this film a 7 but Milla Jovovich looked great in this movie! +1Overall Rating: 8/10 Great Entertainment! I never heard so many screams in the theater before, hopefully even more scares and gore in the sequal, hehe.","

"GuyCC","28 March 2002","Admittedly, I had my hesitations about this film.  I really, really wanted to like this movie, but the way some magazines and on-line sites were talking about the plot synopsis (a computer turning people into the undead and not the game's T-Virus), I had some concerns.  Fortunately, after seeing the film, my concerns were eased, and such rumors didn't come to pass.This film now resides in my ""Top 3"" (Mortal Kombat and Final Fantasy being the other two) of video game based films.  And this is how the film should be looked at: A film that relies on a video game for its source material and story set-up.  The film starts out slow, offering background information on the Umbrella Corporation, and introducing the viewer to the victims caught up in a situation they were ill-prepared to handle.  The scenes (especially the Hive map layout) are set up like a video game.  Again, for this type of film, it can get away with this and work properly if kept in that frame of mind.  Once the zombies appear, the tone of the film gets much more intense, especially with scenes from some of the game's more ""popular"" enemies.For a horror film, it's not as gory as I would have expected.  It does have its fair share of ""gross"" moments, but succeeds more in some good old fashioned jumps and false ""gotcha"" scares scattered throughout the film. What really surprised me was that the film actually had some brief flashes of nudity in it.  Then again, this really isn't a movie for kids, and I'm glad this wasn't dumbed down to be so.The acting was decent, introducing new characters to the RE world (which kept things unpredictable as to who lived and who died, which made it more interesting in my opinion), and being the same director who did the original Mortal Kombat film, it was filled with plenty of flashy fight scenes to fast music.  What really sat well with me in regards to this film is that the movie made plenty of subtle references to elements from the games (the crows, Nemesis, the mansion, limited ammo comments, etc.) without screaming to the audience ""Hey, this prop is also from the game!  This scene is just like the game!  We included everything whether it needed to be there or not just to keep RE fans happy!""  While I'm sure some people would have delighted in seeing the protagonists pushing around statues and opening doors with playing card-shaped keys, the movie rewards the die-hard fan with plenty of references if they look hard enough.  The feel of the game was captured without going overboard.Granted, some people have likened the film to ""Aliens"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"", but that's something of a moot point.  Yes, there are similarities, and no the story isn't the most original thing out there, but the game series does take inspiration from such films to enhance the tension for the game.  Basing these elements from the game for a movie only makes things come full circle.  The film is meant to capture the feel of the game and provide some entertainment while it's at it.  In that regard, it succeeds in what it sets out to do.So is it worth it?  If you enjoy the games, then yes.  It's fun, it's got its creepy moments, it's got a great ending sequence (excellent ""closure"" for the film, if you can call it that), and hopefully the sequel won't go the way of the second Mortal Kombat film (read: bad).Hopefully, there will be a Director's Cut DVD.  I have a feeling that some scenes were cut out of this.  Excellent popcorn fare, and a future addition to my DVD collection.","

"jake-179","17 March 2002","This is a fast paced, high-tech, high-action, horror film that keeps you entertained from beginning to end.  There have been other attempts at bringing video games to the big screen that had miserable results.  Of course, we all remember the ill-fated Mario Brothers movie.  MORTAL KOMBAT was probably the biggest let down.  TOMB RAIDER was not as bad, but still failed to really ""wow"" audiences.  So far, I would say RESIDENT EVIL is the best video-game-gone-big-screen so far.  The plot outline is pretty simple:  A team of commandos venture in to a secret corporate research base to discover what went wrong and why all the employees were killed off.  They find out that horrible experiments were taking place and a biological terror is released in the form of vicious, flesh-eating zombies.  They have to find the antidote and get out before they are sealed inside forever.  The film moves fast.  There are a lot of scares, some of which are set up with fast editing, but the film pulls it off effectively.  The gore abounds and is VERY well done.  Some of the disfigurements of the zombies was done with CGI to great effect.  There is one zombie that is missing a large portion of his head, which pretty much looks like swiss cheese, and that effect is both startling and grotesque.  I loved!  And if Zombies are not enough for you, there are also zombie dobermans.  And if that doesn't give you nightmares, there is a big, Frankenstien/Alien-from-hell monster that breaks loose from its incubation chamber that probably will give you nightmares. Besides the great effects, there are a lot of cool scenes throughout the movie.  The highlight of which is probably the part where the commandos are sliced up with a laser beam.  Also, the gore effects here are fantastic. (The end of the guy's knife getting sliced off and falling on the floor was a nice touch!)  In fact, this movie is a lot gorier than I anticipated it would be.  It is much more gore-infested than most movies that have been coming out in recent years.  So that is a breath of fresh air to a horror fan like me.  In some ways, the movie amounts to a very well done ""B"" horror flick.  If you are like me, you will love that kind of stuff.  Although this is not a perfect movie, the second act is long and well developed.  By this I refer to the characters getting further and further in to trouble.  The situation gets worse, and then, just when you think the situation could not get any worse, it gets WORSE still!  Which creates some good suspense and great action scenes which build up to a fantastic third act with an exciting final battle on the train.  Without giving anything away, I will just say that the conclusion was really well done.  I really liked the ending, not only because it was creepy and the final special effect was really grandiose, but because we get to see Milla Jovovich's muffin...who could ask for anything better?  She certainly doesn't seem to have a problem getting naked, which is a good thing.  Made me reminisce of the good old horror movies of the early 80's.  Only two minor complaints.  The part where Milla starts breaking everybody's neck, I didn't really buy that.  The human neck doesn't break so easily. Although, dying with Milla's thighs wrapped around my neck sounds like a pretty nice way to go.  And sometimes the characters get in to deep trouble and then the movie doesn't really explain how they got out of that trouble. This doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film, however. 
If you liked ALIENS and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (my all time favorite horror/zombie movie) then you will like RESIDENT EVIL.  Don't make the mistake of thinking this is another bummer of a video game/movie.  It is an effective horror movie all on it's own.","

"emfern13","22 August 2002","Resident Evil is awesome. It is the best adaption of a video game to a movie. It is better than Tomb Raider. It doesn't have as many visual effects but it is still better. Milla Jovovich and Angie are really good action heroes but i think Milla is just a little better because she is a newer character. The script for RE is a little better than Tomb Raiders but neither one of them is very good. Resident Evil is an awesome well thoughtout movie.","

"UthinnkUknoMe","19 April 2016","I want to start off this review by saying that I am a fan of the video game franchise- far more than I am the film franchise. However, this review is an honest review about the film- Resident Evil- and the overall film franchise. For starters the film kicks-off with a laboratory catastrophe, a viral outbreak of sorts which in turn, forces an emergency lock down on the facility leaving many for dead- setting the tone for the overall story line to this film. Milla Jovovich plays Alice, a woman who mysteriously awakens from an unconscious state which is implied to be taking place after the lab catastrophe. The mystery revolving her whereabouts, her identity, and the lingering sensation that she may be in immediate danger soon draws the audience in for the remaining 90 minute, action-packed Sci-Fi thriller!Alice, along with a clean-up crew made up of a special military unit, soon unravel the horrible truth as to why the laboratory was put into lock down and the doors should have stayed locked! Brought to you with a chilling soundtrack, plenty of intense horror sequences, and jam-packed with some exciting choreography and action- Resident Evil is a truly timeless Sci-Fi thriller. Unlike its preceders, Resident Evil provides an intriguing story, a solid and likable cast, and ties up its own loose ends before setting us up for the sequel to follow. Without a doubt in my mind, Resident Evil is by far the best film in the entire franchise. This is a film that knew exactly what it wanted to provide its audience- a fast-paced Sci-Fi thriller that would be enjoyable to those who played the games and to those who didn't- and needless to say Resident Evil nailed it! If you're a fan of the genre and have yet to get your hands on a copy, I highly recommend doing so. As stated, this a timeless flick that is great to watch for a little bit of action, suspense, and everything else you'd expect from a Sci-Fi film. 8/10 - and by far the best film of the franchise!","

"Elvis-Del-Valle","26 March 2023","I can't say if it's good as an adaptation, since I don't know videogames and it sucks me, but I grew up with this movie and I really love it, since it was through this film that I got to know the franchise. It's a somewhat unique movie in that it's something different and reminiscent of a typical B-movie. It's hard to explain, but I have no reason to consider this movie bad. The special effects, the makeup, the soundtrack by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson and even Milla Jovovich are sensational. This is hands down one of Paul Anderson and Milla Jovovich's best movies and I can't do anything but give it a 10/10.","

"Rusty-61","15 August 2002","I can't compare the game to the movie that well, since I've only played the game once or twice in the arcade and didn't last very long before I got eaten. (Check the trivia section on the IMDB if you want more info on that, though beware of many spoilers) I don't know if the game has any more of a backstory than the DVD box did: a virus is accidentally unleashed at an underground biological research facility that turns all the employees, lab animals, and experiments into flesh-eating undead. A rescue team discovers too late they are stuck in there with them; they have 3 hours to get out without getting eaten or, worse, infected  before the Red Queen' master computer permanently shuts down all the exits.On the negative side, it was a little longer than an action movie needs to be-- 10 minutes could have been trimmed, I caught myself wanting to hit forward and skip scenes in the first half hour of people wandering warily around deserted areas. I've never wanted to do that with a Romero movie. It does take a little too long to get going, but when the action kicks in, trust me, it doesn't let up, to the point where I felt kind of battered after the movie-- really unrelenting. I couldn't stand the industrial/techno soundtrack, but then I don't usually listen to bands with song titles like Fistf*ck' and `My Plague (New Abuse Mix)'. I guess it was appropriate for the movie, I didn't exactly expect, say, Oingo Boingo (though that would have been kind of cool, now that I think of it) but it was grating after a while. Several shots were extremely derivative of Romero, but since I haven't watched the featurettes or commentaries, I'm not sure if the filmmakers intended them as a tribute/in-joke (like the newspaper headline blowing around a deserted street proclaiming THE DEAD WALK, always great to see in any movie) or just ripped them off with the plan to say they were inspired by' the other movie if anyone pointed out the similarities.
The end seemed to be setting up for a sequel (according to the IMDB, one is planned but not even in pre-production), though at least not in an extremely cliched way, and it mainly irritated me because it was a cliffhanger. There's also several CGI shots where the monster looks about as realistic as the one in the actual game; I did not for a moment forget I was watching CGI, and it was VERY easy to tell where the animatronics ended and the CGI began in several key scenes.OK, enough of what didn't work. On the plus side, Milla Jovovich has proven herself to be one of the few genuinely talented model-turned-actresses, and gives a great performance. I was kind of disappointed in Michelle Rodriguez's acting, mainly because she was so good in Girlfight, but she was acceptable and at least can really look like a badass. There's quite a few fun--and sick--shots. There were plot twists that I actually didn't see coming--sorry to say, I could see most of the jumps walking up 5th Avenue-- and the plot was a lot more brutal and downbeat than I expected (for a movie based on a video game, and for a modern zombie movie, anyway)--good for them. They did definitely outright steal some ideas from Dawn of the Dead (and, as everybody has already probably pointed out, Cube) but at least had some originality by putting a slightly new twist on them. There was a much higher body count than I thought (not counting all the zombie employees, of course, I mean among the heroes), most of which was pretty ballsy. Characters did not die in the order I expected them to. Things got pretty cold-blooded (so to speak).I'd recommend it for a rental, if you want a mindless, scary action movie with some real suspense. You could do a lot worse (like rent the director's Mortal Kombat, for instance) Not bad for a mainstream studio movie based on a game.","

"Terryfan","10 September 2012","Hard to believe this movie came out ten years ago.This is the first of the live action Resident Evil movies based off the video game of the same name.For the record the reason the movies are not based off the games fully is because Capcom requested the filmmakers not too because they were worry that the fans wouldn't buy the games but watch the movies.Being since games and movies cost just about the same amount of money to make them so I can understand Capcom's point of view.However now that we got that out of the way lets get started on this movie.The Story kind of feels like Resident Evil the game where a Mansion is the base of operation for the HIVE Umbrella's hidden lab where the T-Virus escape killing all the workers in the HIVE.Our main Character Alice played by Milla Jovovich who suffers from a effect that causes her to lose her memories.So when Alice meets Matt Addison played by Eric Mabius they are soon taking by a Special Forces team with Rain played by Michelle Rodriguez they are send in to find out what happen in the HIVE only for it to become a mission for survival against countless waves of Zombies and Monsters.Paul Anderson played the game before making the movie so at least he gave the game a try before making the movie and from what he said in interviews he fell in love with the games so he wanted to make a movie out of it.And to tell you the truth the movie really give me chills watching it because of the fact that the zombies and zombie dogs and Lickers the main villain in the movie looking so real that it really makes your heart race.So if you're a fan of horror movies or a fan of the Resident Evil Series I would recommend checking out this movie.Beware the movie is very graphic for some scenes so you got to have a strong stomach for it Nonetheless a good movie for fans and I recommend checking out I give Resident Evil a 8 out of 10","

"tenten76","25 July 2002","I do have one criticism - I have (as far as I know) perfect hearing, so I don't appreciate having my eardrums ripped to shreds by what is easily the loudest film I've ever seen.  Even though I was in an empty cinema (matinees are so cool), the dialogue was at the right volume so there was no reason (other than for cheap scares) to whack the volume up to maximum and make me jump out of my seat every two minutes.On with the praise -The film is pacey, and keeps to a pretty simple but effective plot - very similar (I believe) to the videogame.  A great opening shows what went wrong, and then we're into the action.  There's a clever plot device (oh alright, it's a map), which I thought really worked well to branch the gap between the feel of a computer-game and a film.The actors are unfamiliar-enough that they don't detract, and Milla does a great job as the heroine.  There's a neat little rip-off of a scene from Cube (which is a great film too), and the zombies are really really good.I saw a behind-the-scenes preview with Paul Anderson at a film festival last year, where he explained how much effort went into making the zombies and special effects believable, and I think they did a fantastic job.  I know this will be sacriligeous to some, but I find Romero's stuff way too OTT. Previously, zombies have only really worked in a comedy sense - Braindead, Evil Dead, the Thriller video etc. so it's nice to see them done convincingly.  The dogs look great too.  The Licker looked good, but could have had a bigger role (it reminded me of the monster from The Relic, only naked), but the way they get rid if it made me laugh.Other good things - Milla Jovovich looks fantastic all the way through, and does a pretty good job too.  Michelle Rodriguez seems to be enjoying herself, even if her lines are a bit too Sanchez (from Aliens).  The ending was excellent - really sets you up for a sequel, without feeling short-changed.Apart from turning the volume up to 11 to scare me, my only other whinge would be that one of the squad characters (the whiney one) utters the ""we're all gonna die"" line - but I did appreciate the way lots of other cliched moments were neatly sidestepped.If you want to see a very attractive woman kill convincing zombies in an entertaining and vaguely futuristic action/horror movie, go see it.","

"graestella","26 May 2005","I expected a slick American CGI explosion fest from this. The Film 4 logo on the opening credits was a bit of a give away. What we got was a cheapo British film with limited special effects and crap sets. The only special effects that were tagged onto this prosaic exploration of concrete tunnels and an office building were the laser slice up session, the CGI Alien creature rip off, the unexplained red dogs ( some which seemed to be a real dog covered in paint )a few slow motion bullets a la Band of Brothers and the Matrix and the hologram of the little girl. The rest was low budget British TV movie fare of the lowest order. Very basic zombies. i.e paint ordinary blokes in white paint, and add a bit off blood. Then the script. Where do you begin ? Basically take Aliens Space Marines and replace them with clichéd SAS types straight out of Ultimate Force. Don't even change the Hispanic girl Marine from Aliens, keep her in. Chuck in some Bourne Identity amnesia for the two central characters. This helps when they look bored and confused and disclaim their lines as if wishing they were somewhere else. Add some water. Hey it worked in the Abyss ! Then when the rushes still seem boring, throw in two nearly nude scenes of Mila for the teenage pervs to salivate over. If they'd had the bottle to make them fully nude it might have been worth the wait. But like everything else in this shoddy film they were half hearted.","

"TechnicallyTwisted","27 March 2002","I had heard good things about this movie.  That it was a video game movie that worked,  that it was actually scary.  It is with great disappointment, then, that I must report that Resident Evil was none of those things.  There are so many problems with this film.  The main one being that all the characters and performances are excruciatingly one-note.  The worst of the bunch is Michelle Rodriguez who never strays from that horrible scowl she has on her face the entire film.  Milla Jovovich, while nice to look at, gives a dull and lifeless performance.  The rest of the cast is simply forgettable.  This movie ends with a set-up for a sequel which LOOKS to be more promising than this one, but if Paul Anderson is in charge forget it. This doesn't measure up in any aspect to the classic George A. Romero zombie trilogy.  This movie takes the genre that Romero practically invented, (and which the video games admirably payed homage too) and destroys it.  Please Mr. Romero make a new zombie film to erase the awful memory of this sorry excuse for a movie about the walking dead!  Either that or I'll just have to watch Dawn of the Dead again and again and again and again.....","

After the 5th element I did not have much hope for Milla, but she impressed me.  She has learned quite a lot, and she is still very easy on the eyes.  As to the bothersome plot points  the red Queen is trying to kill the Sanitation crew in a closed tube with a LASER.  First she uses a single beam and then she goes to a net? Would an intelligent computer waste time playing around or just go for one pass and be done with it.  And when Michelle Rodriguez is dying in the train  and then comes back and says I'm not dead yet, but actually she is  come on that has been done to death.  She had done great with that role too.

"Big Movie Fan","12 July 2002","Day of the Dead was the last great zombie film in my opinion and that was released back in 1985. Since then, there have been several mediocre zombie films but this isn't one of them.Firstly, I haven't played the computer game at all so I cannot comment on how it relates to this movie. As a movie, it stands out on it's own.It mixes action and horror very well and the actors and actresses all play a good part. Usually in zombie movies the people battling the zombies have no personality but everyone in this movie does. The military type people make a great impact looking all trigger happy but you soon start to feel sorry for them and care for them as characters. At first you are not sure why some of the characters are there but it's great to see things unravel throughout the movie.This was the first movie in a long time where I kept jumping at certain scenes. I won't spoil those scenes for you but there are some really creepy scenes in this film. The zombies and other creatures in it are probably going to give me and my girlfriend a few sleepless nights because they were so scary.All in all, a pat on the back for those involved in this movie. It was very exciting and I shall probably have to go out now and hire a computer console in order to play the game so I can take part in the action myself.","

"sarastro7","12 January 2004","I can't believe that an actress who's been working for so long is still only 29 years old! She ages with supreme grace, and has *never* looked better than she does in Resident Evil. Wow!The movie itself is fair. Not great, not terrible. Pretty good SFX. It's a techno zombie thriller, and for what it is, it's effective enough. Considering how bad movies based on computer games usually are, this one is pretty good, although it has problems getting started. There are a few scenes that don't make sense (and that cop - Matthew? - where does he really come from?), and it's never really clear that there's only one of the CGI mutating zombie animals loose. The technobabble explanation we get for the zombies is a worthy attempt to ""technofy"" the zombie genre, but it doesn't quite work, esp. not the part about the ""need to feed"". All in all the movie brings back memories of Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, and I'm sure the sequel will, too.Milla Jovovich gives good face. She doesn't really have anything to do for the first 45 minutes (other than look beautiful, of course), but she's very cool when she starts pouring on the kicks and punches, and her character is likable and heroic (and did I mention good-looking? And that outfit she's wearing...!). One wants to see more of her. With some better writing, this sort of role would be perfect for her. Accessible, kick-ass adventure with an appealing female lead (or several). If movie-makers know what's good for them, this is the kind of thing they should do more of. Much more.","

"videofreak2002","17 March 2002","This movie just plain rocks!  It has great blood scenes, great cast (Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez), great music (Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Madson), and great story (written by Paul Anderson).  It's a great movie-adaption from a video game.I was so happy to see Anderson back on the director's chair. The last time he taggled a movie based on a game was 1995's ""Mortal Kombat"" (which I consider to be the best movie-adaption from a game.  The sequel was good too).  But, the last movie Paul made was 1998's flop ""Soldier"" (which was also good).  Even his 1997's ""Event Horizon was also good.  Not only that, he also wrote and co-produced the movie.  His first time writing and directing a movie since 1994's ""Shopping.""  If you think ""Resident Evil"" is gonna be better than ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Final Fantasy,"" you're right.  This movie is heart-pounding from beginning to end.  Check it out.One last note to Paul Anderson: BRING ON THE SEQUEL!!!!  And make sure you write and direct it as well.

"jgusw","25 July 2002","I'm going to get to the point on this one.  This was a good movie.  But if you're a fan of the video game and you're one of those nic-pick and this and that, than just stay away from this one.  The truth is that NO MOVIE WILL EVER BE LIKE THE VIDEO GAME!!!  Resident Evil movie is the video game like X-Men movie is to comic.  If you're a fan than take this movie for what it is:  a movie.  Save that ""that can't happen"" or ""that's not the way it is in the video game"" for your friends who care.","

"Kingtokeyshawn","24 March 2002","Does anyone else see the relation of Umbrella and Enron, although Umbrella's deception turnouts to be a little more deadly?  For those of you that are confused I am talking about the major corporation that does play a pivotal role in the plot of this movie(contrary to critical and cynical belief a plot does exist).My advice towards the other reviews that you are reading too is to be wary of any extreme take on this movie. Some people gave it a 1 out of 10 and that is not realistic because they were p***ed off by something in the movie thus shredding to part the entire film with fabrications and unbelievable exaggerations that actually made me laugh.  On the other hand be wary of someone who gives it a 10 out of 10 because they might be one of those crazed, lunatic biased fans that jumps at the sound of an unexpected groan.Although I have to admit that I am a biased fan of the game and I did go into this movie extremely pumped, I also had expectations for the film to live up to.  And just being able to say that I like a film that I have expectations for, much less being sucked into says a lot. Now enough of this BS credibility stuff let me tell you about an a thriller of an action/horror movie.  The first thing that jumps to mind when I think about Resident Evil- beginning, middle and end- is the atmosphere.  There was just something about the movies extremely fast pace, tense feeling and genuine dread that made me connect to the picture.  Granted I do have my ""I wish"" 's about the film too but like the others said, its a horror flick you let them slide and keep an open mind so that you are able to enjoy the rewarding aspects of the film, which are fresh, unexpected and plentiful.Milla makes me think that there are few things more sexy than a woman with a gun.  She is stunning throughout the picture and honestly feels like the only character developed by the way she plays her role outside of the dialogue and story development.  As Alfred Hitchcock once said (not in his exact words) ""a really good actor saves you 20 minutes of character development because the audience buys into the character"" and Milla does this.  You really get a good feel for who her character is by just watching her and she is the one person that I got attached to.  Now if we could have only gotten a little more out of the other characters in terms of story development.  I also felt that Hugh Jackman could have fit perfectly as the prisoner in this movie, but it did have a small budget.  The movie is also unique in its pace as it never slows down and you honestly cannot look away for a second for fear of missing something critical, which you might.  I have never ever seen a picture move faster.  This again adds to the atmosphere of the movie that I felt comparable to Memento or the Matrix. If you know the feel of those movies then you know what I am talking about.The action choreography is very good and better than most movies and there are even some scenes that will leave you saying ""awesome"" and ""glad I wasnt that zombie getting my neck snapped.""  I felt that the special forces as protaginists with guns gave the movie more validity and realism, as well as staying true to the game.  Of course there are also some great sequences with the hardware which also left me impressed.  I am anticipating the DVD of this movie already because I would love to see if there is a directors cut of that gives us a little more in character development and in turn would add to the story.  The thought of this however might take away from the razor fast pace, which creates the critical and unique atmosphere that Resident Evil video gamers definitely are familiar with.  Overall I would give this movie 9 out of 10 as I am rating it based on what it is.  A movie that is well above par from your average horror flick bringing in a realistically scary storyline and solid plot that aside from a little more development and omission of a few cheesy scenes and one liners could be one of the classic horror movies of all time.  This film will not disappoint the gamers either and fans of Milla, as I am now one of them after watching this movie, will respect her performance.  She is the standout in this film. Also look for the things that make the horror picture a different type of scary movie.  Director Paul Anderson uses the element of terror to scare the sh*t out of you and that is rare in a scary movie and I find it more terrifying. Moreover the original concept and conscious effort to avoid cliches left a refreshing taste in my mouth, but an extremely paranoid and skittish mind waiting for a zombie to reach from the back seat of my car on the ride home and take a chunk out of my neck.","

"jaredmobarak","21 September 2007","Paul WS Anderson has given us the newest trilogy of diminishing returns. I have never played the video game before and therefore went into the 2002 original Resident Evil containing little knowledge of the mythology. With that novice mentality, I found myself really enjoying the film. It gave me the background needed, the action and suspense expected, and a cliffhanger leaving me anticipating more. That continuation came but two years later with the subtitle Apocalypse. Here was a film that showed how the series' origin story was a huge part to the main plot of the first. This entry featured a bare-bones story, namely the extraction of a scientist's child from the infected Raccoon City, yet that was okay. The action was amped up, the characters more accessible, the acting vastly superior, and the ingenuity evolved. While lacking in plot, it excelled in action and effects, making it an equal, in my mind, to its predecessor. Its final twenty minutes was even devoted entirely to setting up the third piece to the puzzle. Here, though, is where the train derails hard. Extinction had a fantastic setup, yet instead of continuing right where we left off, we meet a caravan of survivors seeking gas and motoring cross-country. Nothing is progressed story-wise that we already did not know. Where the sparse plot didn't matter in the second, it stuck out like a sore thumb with the latest installment.It is Milla Jovovich's total blank slate in the first film, which makes it so endearing. We learn what the Umbrella Corporation is all about as she slowly remembers her role with them. It was a successful zombie movie, utilizing the jump scares and the hyperkinetic pace needed to keep you on the edge of your seat. All the characters were enjoyable to spend time with, we got zombified dogs, and a story that kept a bit of intrigue as to what everyone's motives were, while also being intelligent enough to keep my full, undivided attention throughout. The demise of all the people involved was interesting and to have a film end badly for all was a nice breath of fresh air. Alice does wakes up at the end, alone in a ravaged city, but she is definitely not in a position to rest up or smile at her good fortune.The transition into the second film is then seamless. We find that she didn't just wake up, but in fact is an experiment let loose on a city that cannot be saved. Our two survivors from the original are now pitted against each other to see which is the better soldier, and therefore the more effective military weapon. This fight is the entire story, though, as far as the main mythology goes. Otherwise, we have Alice and her new band of warriors on the lookout for the virus' creator's daughter. In effect, then, the whole story could have been told in about twenty minutesthey go in and get the child, Alice and Nemesis fight, boom, the film is over. However, the tale is padded with huge action sequences and gory zombie carnage. With the addition of Mike Epps to the cast, we are also treated with some nice comic relief, missing somewhat from the first besides Michelle Rodriguez's sarcastic quips. I never minded the simplicity of it all because it never tried to be more than what it was. I stuck with it until the conclusion and found myself even more excited for the third part. The setup had so much potential. Alice was fully formed, all her memory intact, and a new ability in telekinesis. With Nemesis gone and the zombies no match for her, we could finally get to see the showdown between her and the Corporation itself.And with that, we are treated to Extinction. It starts off pretty good with a cloned Alice being put through tests in a mock-up version of the mansion from the first film. It gets intriguing to hear what the scientists have been up to and to learn that Alice is outside trying to find survivors and keep herself off the grid. Then we get the first sign of trouble, an action scene that has nothing to do with the plot. Let's kill some hicks in the desert. If that wasn't enough, we also get a twenty-minute fight between our survivors and crowsyes those pesky black birds, newly infected. Sure the payoff is great, but really we are now halfway through the film and all that has happened is Alice found her old friends. We already knew she had powers and that her blood was special and could mean everything to the project. At the end of the film, that is the exact same knowledge we are left with. Besides many deaths and what could be the beginnings of a complete trainwreck of a sequel, starring no one else but Jovovich, (you'll understand when you see it), we learn absolutely nothing as far as mythology goes. I felt cheated and let down greatly because this film could have done so much more.In conclusion, the trilogy starts strong and ends with a disappointing whimper. The first had everything you could have wanted in a sci-fi/zombie/action flick. Scares, plot twists, and loads of violence and gore rounded out the successful entry. In came the second, lacking substance, but making up for it with flare. More characters, which never hurt the proceedings, more blood, more action, and more monsters can only mean non-stop enjoyment. And if the film doesn't deserve an extra point or two for Sienna Guillory's Jill Valentine, then you must have watched a different film from me. Next came the unfortunate failure of a third. What is less even than a bridge to the inevitable fourth, (will the box-office be enough to warrant it?), this last entry is a wasted opportunity to add to a nice little franchise.Resident Evil 7/10 RE: Apocalypse 7/10 RE: Extinction 3/10","

"zedthedestroyer","18 March 2002","It's a zombie flick loosely based on a video game. I had no other expectations other than to be entertained for an hour-and a-half. But the movie went far above my expectations. Yeah, there are similarities to ""Aliens"" and every other George Romero Dead flick, but it didn't detract from my basic enjoyment of the film. With the exception of one or two exposition scenes in the middle, the movie was non-stop. Milla and Michelle were great. And the Red Queen was a nice touch.I can't believe how many people are nitpicking over the inconsistancies between the game and the movie. See it again and suspend your disbelief. I did and enjoyed it. And I own the first 2 games myself.","

"stamper","5 March 2003","The mere idea of watching a zombie film is enough to give me the creeps, not because they are scary, but because every zombie film I've seen was bad and dumb. But lucky for me that I am not prejudiced and decided, in spite of my knowledge that there were zombies in this film, to watch it anyway. The thing that makes this zombie flick a good one, is that there is not too much emphasis on the zombies. They are there, but not all the time, because there are bigger, meaner and more complicated things to worry about which have been beautifully' engineered with computers and are quite original.
Other things that really made me enjoy this film, were the story, the acting and the directing. The story is a pretty complicated one for a zombie film and there are always a few surprises and enough tension to keep the film thrilling and exciting. The fact that the film continues to do that is mainly due to the good acting and the good directing, which we all know if worse enough can screw up a potentially good film. This does not happen here though. Mr.Anderson and his actors have (according to me) succeeded in bringing the first good zombie film onto my TV screen.

"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","21 September 2004","Think 1984 meets Dawn of the Dead. There is a big bad company that gets its funding from secret experiments that involve high tech viral research. Almost everyone has this company's regular products at home so it is virtually unstoppable.The mysterious beginning the story shows someone deliberately releasing the virus into the company's main research lab. Out heroine wakes up, equally mysteriously, in a shower in a strange house which is attacked by commandos whose mission it is to enter and disable the research facility's computer.The story is told from an interesting point of view and the revelations as to what happened are pretty cool. The action scenes are well done and soundtrack is awesome. So overall this movie is a surprise since it is both based off of a game AND conceived by Paul Anderson. This is his best film so far. 8/10","

"JohnLennon1985","25 September 2002","When we think about movies that are based on video games, we think of watchable movies like Tomb Raider and Mortal Kombat (and MK Annihilation). We think about good movies (but horrible adaptations) like Final Fantasy. Most of all, we think about the crappiest movies to ever hit the big screen such as Super Mario Bros., Double Dragon, and Street Fighter. This explains why none of us expect Resident Evil to do justice to the game. How wrong we were.The adaptation was incredible. They don't use any of the characters from the game, but the story remains the same, basically. Milla Jovovich, the Fifth Element babe, teams up with the Fast and the Furious' Michelle Rodriguez as they try to escape an underground facility that's infested with zombies. I'm happy to say that the name of the corporation responsible is STILL Umbrella.The zombies were VERY well done, as were the dogs and lickers(?). The acting was also very good. The movie changed a lot of things, but I respect the fact that it kept the video game's story without filming the video game. That's a very hard thing to do.In short, don't ignore this movie for fear that it won't do the video game justice. It is one of the few game-to-screen adaptations that do.","

"ShinKyo81","16 April 2002","""Resident Evil"" is one of those films that I was expecting with great interest. When the first rumors begun, George A. Romero was in charge of the project. When he jumped out the film, the name of Paul W. Anderson appeared, and everybody thought ""That guy rings me a bell..."".After some research, you realize Anderson as the director of controversial films such as ""Mortal Kombat"" or ""Event Horizon"". And I say controversial because Paul's films have always had such great success and criticism both at the same time. And ""Resident Evil"" will be the next victim...""Mortal Kombat"" was a decent project that came out the same time ""Street Fighter"" did. I admit both films are not a perfection, but Anderson created a better film than Steven de Souza's one. So, and possibly because of the cheesy adaptation of CAPCOM's videogame, ""Mortal Kombat"" succeed in the duel, with good special effects and a few kicks and punches.""Event Horizon"" is one of my favourite movies, combining gore and horror in a very dark atmosphere, which makes this film unique in its genre. It went through the cinemas with little success, but now it's on my TOP10 list. Anderson did a fine job with this movie, helped with the cast crew that were incredible (Sam Neil and Laurence Fishburne).And now we have ""Resident Evil"". First, I quickly recognized the same dark atmosphere of ""Event Horizon"" in ""RE"". This strange way of Anderson to use the colours and the flashbacks, and also some scenarios were exactly reproduced from the videogame saga. The zombie makeup was very good, using CGI to create more realistic details. The Licker... well, if you survived watching the ""Brotherhood of the Wolf""'s monster, you'll manage this one :P.Also, the movie has got incredibly good soundtrack: hard rock from Marylin Manson, Fear Factory, Rammstein and many others; and it fits perfectly with the film. And in addition, the movie has got very good rythm of action, so it absorbs you inside.The good points of the film: Milla Jovovich (of course ^_^), Paul Anderson's peculiar style, tons of action, some good scares and brilliant rythm. The bad points: the cast crew doesn't give an incredible performance, the whole plot is quite messy and the ending is too unconcluded (Sequel needed right now!). And in several scenes you can see the microphone (Anderson check out the takes next time, please)!!! :-PWell, if you liked the other Paul Anderson productions (I haven't seen ""Soldier"", though), you'll really enjoy this one. And if you're also a fan of the videogames, then you'll die for watching ""Resident Evil"" again and again. Waiting for the RE2! Worth a look! 8/10","

This is for people who like John Carpenter films and genre pictures where all that matters is how the characters will stay alive (or conversely, which will die by the end of the movie and how).I played the game briefly a few years ago and was intrigued to see what this movie would be like -- for what it is, it's good!  A fun (albeit LOUD) popcorn flick that will keep you interested and guessing.  It has some flaws (what were those things in the crates? And how many railroad cars have cargo doors on the floor like that?) but I enjoyed this.  And Milla Jovovitch is a hottie!  Loved how they set up the sequel (which we'll see, I presume, if this one pulls down enough box office).","

"dk777","22 August 2022","A film that can be watched many times and that makes it more successful than many films.The casting is excellent. A fun mix of action and horror makes this movie extremely entertaining and interesting. The casting is good, especially Milla Jovovich, who is a great choice for the role of Alice.This movie tries to give the viewer good entertainment and it succeeds. Fun action scenes and tension with a simple formula: a good main character, brutal scenes of violence, a bit of horror and an interesting story.We follow Alice through her monster-filled adventure in an underground facility that she must pass through in order to survive and discover the truth. Today's screenwriters usually ruin such a fun story and burden the viewer with unnecessary things, but luckily this is not such a movie.The main character is not unbearable, arrogant and above all disgusting, on the contrary, the main character Alice is completely opposite to the characters we are used to seeing nowadays, this is a character who is sympathetic, funny and likeable. This is not one of those characters that makes you want to stop watching the movie, quite the opposite. Such characters are unfortunately rare today.This is a film that fulfills its primary purpose, which is to entertain the viewer, and that is something that it certainly succeeds in doing.","

"vanillacoke420","21 March 2005","I saw this when it first was up on the big screen, and then while I thought it was pretty cool I kinda forgot about it. Then a few days ago I saw it on TV, and I have to say, it's definitely better than I remember it now.It starts out in a slightly surreal style as we get to follow the employees of the Umbrella Corp., and the events leading to the disaster in the underground laboratory. Then in the same style we get to follow an agent waking up and how she meet the SWAT-like squad she's to work together with to set things straight again.The overall feeling of the movie is hard to describe but I like it. No nonsense, just straight forward action. No second wasted. I am sure there were clichés in this film but certainly not many and apparently they didn't bother me anyway. Usually when you watch a B action you can get bored simply because it's like every other B action. Not so with Resident Evil, which was not B in my opinion.Visually, it's also great. At times it was almost a dream-like feeling, from the intro laboratory scenes to the scenes from Alice's home; and most that happened thereafter.As for storytelling, it told us what we needed to know, nothing more. If there's anything from the introduction scenes that leaves us wondering what in the world happened, who did it and why, we will get the answers as the story moves on.Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriquez both make their parts really well in my opinion. I have not seen Milla in many other movies but what I've seen so far, I definitely like. Michelle was entirely new to me as far as I know, but I liked her performance.My complaint could possibly be that some devices in the laboratory seemed a bit of a stretch, especially one particular security defense mechanism that they encountered early on.All in all, a good action that is somewhat unusual in its style.","

Now if you don't know the game this is a 'okay' if somewhat lackluster Zombie film, After all it's standard fair for a movie of it's type.My problems with it stems from the fact this movie has NOTHING to do with it's source material but name alone. It felt like it was written by someone that didn't even read the crib sheets for the Resident Evil Game but ONLY skimmed them(briefly).That is my biggest complaint, it seems standard fair these days in Hollywood to slap on a name recognition titles on to movies with little to do with the source material. That's my complaint to the point, if this film had been more faithful to it's title (No Tyrant, Mansion, Jill, Chris or ANY characters from the game used or referenced to in the slightest.)I might have enjoyed it more.But as it stands it's at best a sub par overrated zombie film with a misplaced title.

"Gideon40","23 March 2002","i've played most of the RE games, and the movie thankfully does not disappoint. This movie got an nc-16 rating in singapore, and i think its because of this one scene where SPOILER this bunch of commandos literally get diced into little pieces by a laser(especially the laser 'net' part, that was really sick)END OF SPOILER but overall the movie wasn't *that* gory. I thought there should have been more scenes where the commandos are blasting the zombies, but the movie focussed more on the suspense, which it did very well. The story is a mixture of the first and second RE games. The final 'boss fight' was very familiar to the 2nd one.Overall this is the best videogame-movie, and it certainly doesn't suck like tomb raider did. Thankfully it doesn't focus on milla's figure (except in a couple of scenes). Just try not to barf when you see the laser corridoor scene.","

With awesome special effects and a fantastic group of actors, this movie is a must-see for all Resident Evil, horror and/or sci-fi fans.The movie stars the lovely Milla Jovovich as Alice, a woman who was the victim of short-term amnesia and was suddenly drafted into an odd and unusual mission not meant for the-light-of-heart.Ms. Jovovich's co-star, the equally lovely Michelle Rodriguez as Rain, a no-nonsense, hardened, gonna-kick-your-ass-if-you-look-at-me-wrong kind of woman.  Armed with a machine gun, she was not about to let anything get in her way.Together, along with a few other military agents and Matt, a man who is not who he claims to be, they fight their way through Umbrella Corporation to complete their mission and eventually to save their own lives.All-in-all, this movie was fantastic.  Solely for its entertainment value, I gave this movie 9 out of 10 stars.

"starwolf","17 March 2002","This is the very first time I have seen someone take a video game and do a good job of turning it into a movie. Excellently done. The critics I see carping about the lack of originality just don't get it. I saw one of them say something about zombies not as good as ""Night of the Living Dead"" and a train not as big as ""Ghosts of Mars."" Doesn't he get it? The zombies were pretty much exactly as they were the game -shambling, shuffling along until they are close enough to attack, and then diving in for that bite! The train, of course, was lifted pretty much exactly from the game. They weren't trying for a ""Ghosts of Mars"" type thing.Milla was amazing. I read another review that claimed ""Tomb Raider"" would be considered a better movie because it had a higher babe factor. Well yes, Angelina Jolie is a babe, but guess what, so is Milla. And the story line was a heck of a lot better than ""Tomb Raider."" It had a point, was internally consistent, and a great setup for the start of the game.In case you're unsure of my point, I heartily approve. Great job with the movie.","

"Sil-7","27 February 2002","I was lucky enough to see Resident Evil in a Sneak Preview in Vienna, Austria. As usual for the horror genre the movie is rather short (around 90mins) but not a second of it is boring.The movie starts off with a virus being released in an underground research center called ""the Hive"". The A.I. closes all exits and kills everyone inside to keep the virus contained. When our main character (Milla Jovovich) awakes in the shower, she has no memory of who she is. A group of soldiers takes her along to the Hive that is located under the building she woke up. They don't tell her much, only that she was supposed to protect the entrance. Everyone who knows the computer game knows what follows: tons of zombies.The story evolves rather nicely since we never really know more than the main character. The suspense added by this to the known genre plot of ""get out before they kill you"" is a nice little extra. There is nothing to complain about the special effects and the action is well executed though obviously inspired by the Matrix in some places. The music is effective, loud and fits the movie.I really enjoyed it and I think that fans of movies like ""Pitch Black"" or ""The Relic"" will enjoy it too. Splatter-fans might be somewhat disappointed, the gore factor isn't higher than in any of the movies mentioned above. Fans of the video games will notice nice little tidbits taken from the games and even if I played only part of one of them, I liked the attention to the details (for example the sound that the zombies make, the equipment used, the enemies encountered and most importantly: the end). I can only recommend this movie to fans of the genre and to everyone who played one of the games.","

"geckodude","26 July 2002","Essentially, I was extremely unimpressed by this movie because of the wasted opportunity that it was!  This review may contain spoilers! (- if this movie can be spoiled by giving away plot details!)To put this in context, I have never played the game but have always been aware of it and its reputation.  I have always enjoyed the classic zombie movies of the 70's & 80's.  As such, I felt it would make a good movie, especially as there have been no good zombie movies for quite a while.The story was quite passable, but not totally engaging.  The acting was also average, but that's what I'd expect from such a movie.  Hell, the greatest zombie movies suffer from poor acting.However, there are 2 major flaws with this movie.  Firstly, the marketing aspect.  It's based on a computer game, therefore it has to appeal to a younger market - there goes any potential for a nice gory movie. Secondly, as a result of this, it's clearly more of an action movie than horror or zombie flick.There are moments that are supposed to be scary but these are all practically signposted - no surprises.  You can practically guess what will happen next.  This isn't a scary movie.  The scary element of a zombie movie is the way these monsters never relent until they've totally ripped apart their victim.  There is literally no blood or gore in this movie - no horror!  The effects of missing body parts might be nicely completed, but the zombie action is ultimately poor.  Does the audience really want to watch another average gung-ho Aliens rip off??The action itself isn't particularly spectacular either.  It's still amazing that these trained killers can't figure out that since body shots have no effect, a head shot might have more impact.  And it was unsurprising to see the introduction of a ""superbeast"" into the movie, to allow for a greater amount of pointless CGI.  Musically, they overdo it on the industrial metal front (an excuse for a tie in CD!!). More atmospherics and sparing using of the industrial metal would have been more effective!This movie is passable entertainment, but it just could have been so much more.  One can only imagine how different this movie would have been if George Romero had remained in charge.  Do yourself a favour, watch the classics (Night Of the Living Dead, Dawn Of the Dead, Day Of the Dead, Zombi 2, Evil Dead) rather than this average action movie!","

"zombear","18 March 2002","Not only is this the best movie to come from a video game since Paul Anderson's own Mortal Kombat (RE may have even topped MK), it's the best American zombie movie in ages!  Sure, it could have been more atmospheric (the RE games provide a feeling of dread that the movie didn't equal) and there could have been more gore, but as it is, it's still an astounding effort.  The creature effects were good (though the CG-ness of some of them was too noticeable), the zombies were creepy and relentless, and Milla Jovovich was fantastic (and hot!)  It ain't quite Night Of The Living Dead or Return Of The Living Dead but it's better than most of the Italian gore-fests, and certainly worth seeing a time or two.","

"anithyng_gose","16 March 2002","Okay, I am going to warn you that the following comments may contain spoilers, because I'm not sure if comparing scenes from the film and the game could be seen as such.Anyway, Resident Evil is less like the video game and more like Event Horizon (by the same director, Paul Anderson) meets Dawn of the Dead (by the man who basically invented zombies, George Romero).  Here's the bad first, as it is a lot easier to recall the bad than the good.
Screw Up #1: Changing the script!  Our Event Horizon director must have really liked his old film, because he decided to rewrite the RE script and make the Umbrella lab a slave of some AI computer, just like the ""living spaceship"" in EH.  It felt more like the team was in battle with the lab instead of the zombies.  And to think they initially had George Romero on the staff and let him get away!Screw Up #2: The zombies (what's left?)! There were no zombies in the mansion like in the game, it was basically ""zip right to the lab to make the movie easier to shoot i.e. more contained.""  The zombies that were in the film were not scary or gory (except for a couple) and unlike older (Romero) zombie films, there was little violence in their destruction.  No humor, no creativity, terribly crowded camera work on many of the ""zombie"" sequences, etc.Screw Up #3: The plot (now what's left?).  The plot was a total rip off of Dawn of the Dead, yet Dawn was a much more entertaining, well-rounded movie. One major difference is that Anderson didn't take any time to develop ANY of the characters, so we really could care less who gets killed.  When the good guys do die, most viewers won't even remember their names at that very moment.Screw Up #4: Translation (yep, that's right).  They did not use ONE character from ANY of the games! Anderson claimed that using characters from the game would make the film too predictable.  I (and I hope you agree) think that was a BAD move.  I think his reason was that he didn't know JACK about the characters, so instead of doing some hard-nosed research on the games  to ""get it right"" he decided to do it ""his"" way. Ouch!Screw Up #5: The ending.  I won't give that away though...The Good: If you saw the commercial or trailer you saw most of the good stuff i.e. the dog getting kicked in the head, the lab sets were great, Milla is so beautiful I think she was the only reason most guys watch the film to the end, and there are a FEW other parts of the movie relative to the game which aren't worth mentioning.  I had mixed feelings about Tomb Raider when I saw it, I thought it was good, but not very deep.  But compared to this, Tomb Raider looks like gold.  Anderson did much better with Mortal Kombat, I'm not sure what happened here.Overall score: 1.5 out of 4 stars","

"Macabro","20 March 2002","Personally, Resident Evil caused me somewhat of a disappointment.  Being that I am a fan of horror and consider myself to be a connoisseur in the genre, I went to the movie theatre with the idea that I was going to see real zombies; such as those in George Romero's trilogy or Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2, even like those in the classic B movie Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things.  But it was nothing like that.  On the contrary, the zombies in Resident Evil looked stupid and not scary at all.  What happened to the classic zombie moans and humming?  The facial close-ups?  The gore? The explicit zombie attacks? The loud bites and zombie appetite?  And the list can go on just to compare what a classic zombie movie should be versus the new zombies such as the ones portrayed in Resident Evil where even some of the zombies faces were computer generated.
It seems like good horror films will not make a come back to the big screen. There have been many, such as Scream, Urban Legend, I Know what you did Last Summer, Disturbing Behavior, Jeepers Creepers and so many more recent films, but none are true to the genre.  There will probably never be another Suspiria, Evil Dead, Inferno, Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Phenomena among others.Now taking Resident Evil from a different point of view: it is an OK Hollywood movie, entertaining and very similar to the video game (T-virus, killer Dobermans, Train, Licker, Umbrella).  Milla Jovovich beauty enlightens the screen and her performance is pretty good.  Overall the film is watchable, not the greatest but still entertaining.","

Michelle Rodriguez is definitely one to look out for as well.  I love her fearless tough-girl demeanor-she's awesome!  I'm not too familiar with the video game, but it does sound interesting...even though there were scenes in reference to Thir13een Ghosts and how could we forget-Night of the Living Dead, I still thought it very entertaining.","

"Cicman69","22 September 2002","I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie. I've never played the video game nor did I pay any attention to the movie when it was in theaters. But, when my friend suggested we watch it on pay-per-view, I figured ""What the heck?""--POTENTIAL SPOILERS.The special effects are decent, but nothing out of the ordinary given the technology we have today. The acting is marginal, but not too wooden. But my biggest complaint with the movie is the total lack of originality. Come on, dead people brought back to life, who seek human flesh? Can you say ""already been done many, many times?"" Guess how you kill the zombies? By shooting them in the head. Gee, sounds just like ""Night Of The Living Dead""Avoid this one unless your buddy is paying for the rental.","

"The_Wood","15 March 2002","Flaws and all, Resident Evil manages to be a pretty darn entertaining picture.  This is one of the first FUN films we've seen all year -- it's heads and above trash like The Time Machine.  As one might assume -- the film is full of problems.  For an R rated picture that contains ZOMBIES, the film doesn't have nearly enough gore as it should.  Speaking of zombies -- the zombies in this picture could use some work -- terrible make-up at times.  A good amount of the action scenes are sloppy -- the director just kind of throws the camera into the carnage and the audience is suppose to make sense of it all.  The film has a lot of problems like this, but it still manages to deliver on the goods.  The film benefits from an amazingly sexy Milla Jovovich.  She makes the film work much in the same way Angelia Jolie made Tomb Raider the guilty pleasure it was.  The film also stands up pretty well when you compare it to the video games (which I myself am a fan of).  Not a very good film, but if you are in the mood for some zombie killing but a sexpot, like I was -- you probably won't be disappointed.","

This film was great it not only had a great story it also spooked you with out having to show graphic details in blood and gore unlike night of the living dead and all other zombie movies.  The actors in the movie were my favorite thing,  Milla Jovovich is awsome in this role and so is Michelle Rodriguez because there tough and know how to kick zombie butt. Also Eric Mabius was awsome in this movie.  I am just mostly upset on the cool characters that are killed.","

"GenK1981","7 September 2002","First off i think that the critics were very harsh on there comments of this film.  Half of these so called critics probably havn't even heard of the 'Resident Evil' franchise and therefore their comments really dont have any effects to my view on the film.Ok, so it wasnt exactly an award winning film but it still had enough ingredients to make me want to see it again, and buy it on DVD.  Milla Jovovich was quite good as Alice though i did find i couldnt really bond to her as the main character to well.  Michelle Rodgriguez on the other hand was very impressive as the hard-ass Rain, her performance was only marred by the harsh fact that she probably is too young to be in an elite special force??? - but apart from that she was great!  Eric Mabius (Matt), Martin Crewes (Kaplan) and Colin Salmon (One) were all good as supporting cast!The films special effects are brilliant and director Paul Anderson uses his imagination well to build a story around the resident evil game.  It's a shame we didn't get to see more of the mansion in which Resident Evil is known and loved for.  The twisted metal music score is excellent to this film and Marilyn Manson must be applauded in the way he handled the high tense scenes within this movie.Resident Evil: Nemesis is in the pipeline for 2003 and hopefully it will have the same pleasing effect as this film did.  It will also be nice to see some familiar looking characters be introduced into the sequal i.e. Albert Wesker!!A great film - 8/10","

"foxbrick","16 March 2002","Despite good-enough performances from Jovovich, Rodriguez, and the rest of the cast, there is little more good to be said for this film, aside from some handsomely unhandsome zombies.  Did we need a cross between CUBE and Romero's zombie trilogy with an even more ridiculous version of ALIEN's anticorporate slant (when anticorporatism becomes as ridiculous as this, it certainly undercuts real anticorporatism)?  Nonsensical doubletalk, an idiot-plot from the beginning, and not even much in the way of interesting violence.  So, go to see Milla J be fetching and Michelle R be sardonic, but you can probably do that with some other films which might also entertain you.","

"badgirlkane","8 May 2003","Paul W.S Anderson the man behind the Mortal Combat movies made this video game into a very decent horror/zombie film.I heard originally they had asked George A Romero ( The Godfather of Zombie films) to script this and direct this version and honestly as a horror film fan of both mainstream and independent horror films I feel this movie would've been less action film and more horrific if Mr Romero had written the screenplay and directed this film and it would've been more to my liking. However,MR Anderson did do a very good job at keeping this film suspenseful (though at times the filiming background is so dark you can barely see what is going on ) and the gore could have been a little more excessive especially considering this is a Zombie movie but for a mainstream film it was decently gory. Milla Jojovovich was very good as the films heroine and looked kick ass in her evening gown battle-dress and Michelle Rodriguez is hilarious as the overly tough girl character. It stayed as true to the videos game plot as it could and that actually worked well for the film. I have to say i'm actually looking forward to the sequel and am just glad that the Zombie genere has been brought back as after watching countless bad awful Italian zombie films I'm glad that my favorite horror genere is back in some form at least,as it doesn't look like Mr Romero has any plans to do a 4th Living Dead film and the only other talk that Hollywood has is its to  remake the classics that Mr Romero has already done and in my opinion shouldn't be reamde.There are classic horror films.LEAVE THEM ALONE!!!!!!!! but I beleive the sequel to Resident Evil will be sonething to look forward to in the summer of 2004 as will be the much anticipated sequel to Ginger Snaps as well. My only request is please make Resident Evil 2 more gorier and show more of the Nemesis monster as the computer-animated creature in Resident Evil was awesome looking ( and I usually hate computer-aniimated monster as they usually look so FAKE!!) .If you love Zombie films and ahve never seen one start off renting the Living Dead sereis then move on to Lucio Fulci 's classic 1980 fiolm Zombie then check out the underrated 1971 classic Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things , then check out the Resident Evil film. **** out of *****","

"SilverDiamond1987","31 January 2010","Resident Evil is not the best zombie movie, but the best action based on zombies, the battle between humans and zombies. The movie focuses on this battle as it should be, there are not trashy sub stories or there are not dull characters. There is not a cliché scientist who responsible for all the stuff. By the way, the movie is stylish and well executed that the sequels don't have. Also, the whole film is entertaining. Resident Evil is a consistent movie on all counts, direction, script... The mise-en-scene, especially the set designs, camera angles and atmosphere recall computer games. Besides, the laser scene is very high adrenalin and to me one of the most unforgettable scenes, not only of the movie, but also in action cinema. The first battle between Alice, the team and the zombies are my favorite, also a great demo scene. It is very long and satisfying. The make up effects are not flawless, but very impressive, not like the second and third movies (they were flimsy) There could have been more clash with the zombies, but as said, in terms of action and a Resident Evil adaptation, it is satisfying. The dog scenes are interesting, even if a bit funny (karate against animals?) The other Resident Evil movies copied it by the way, because it is really creative. The train scene is also pretty good. As said, mostly, those kind of movies start well, some of them develop well, too, but at the end, something ruins everything. Thus, Resident Evil is an exception. Lastly, yes, as many people think, the closing was one of the best closing scenes ever seen.","

"raving_wolf","9 December 2002","first of all i must admit that i am an avid resident evil player and was skeptic of this film at first, yet still anticipated its release.After walking out of the theatre i was astonished.  I remembered the days when video games first came to the big screen.  I remember the disapointment following such flops as Super Mario Bros., and Street Fighter.  But then there was the satisfaction of Mortal Kombat (not the sequel which sucked hard core) and Final Fantasy: the spirts within.Resident Evil falls in line with Mortal Kombat.  The origional story is kept in tact except for a few details that had to be added to make the movie work.I enjoyed the movie tremendously, in fact a few scenes totally creeped me out, just like the game does, while playing it alone, in a dark room with the volume turned way up.  Although it will always be a trend setting classic, i believe that Resident evil is totally the Night of the living dead of the 2000's...there has not been a great zombie movie since then until now.Recommended to sci-fi fans and gamers alike, and if you haven't tried the game yet and liked the movie, i suggest you get with it.  Both the game and the movie are edge of your seat fright fests that will definately get your heart racing.","

It's impressive a guy like me, that have had watched a thousand movies still didn't look for Resident Evil.Well, RE starts trying to make us want for more. Not just the first scene, but the whole movie. It didn't called my attention that much at the beginning, but te final scenes did. I wanna watch the sequence right now.The best about RE is it's soundtrack. It's what makes this movie convincing, entertaining, frightening and apprehensive at the same time. Even if the soundtrack isen't that original. It is pretty well placed in the right moments, and it's almost constantly throughout the movie. This , and not the scenario is what makes it have a cybernetic_high-tech atmosphere.RE's photography could really be better, a little bit more of dark would be welcome. And talking about photography, I also must say about special effects and GCI computer generated imagery). In 1999, Matrix have had presented us with amazing special effects and cgi, soon, I truly believe monsters could be improved 3 years later, in Resident Evil. Even if it's not the same company working on it.Actors are not that great and sometimes pretty bad, script is the easier ever written. I've watched on English (I'm Brazilian) and still did understand everything they were saying, giving the simplicity of it's language.RE is and entertaining film, won't add much at your knowledge, nothing like cult-movies or the most intelligent ones, but you'll like to spend some hours watching it.Cheers.","

"Nostalgia","21 March 2002","I have some mixed reviews about this movie.  I will detail the good points first and then point out a few flaws or holes in the plot that can make or break your opinion.Good Points:Music, action, zombies, blood, shooting, guns, some flesh flashing are all good points.Action, shooting, guns and blood can all be categorized together.  One compliments the other and it was all well put together.Zombies were fantastic, with their heart stopping surprise thriller moments, great makeup and pretty good but not spectacular computer animated effects. They made me think of the old great Night of the Living dead movies, but the actors that portrayed them were better.Music was fantastic, the score was great for this movie and I was well pumped up for all the action scenes.Flesh Flashing.. well being a guy.. let's just leave it at that..
Bad Points:Not many, while the music and score were great, it was a little too loud at a few points.  The acting wasn't spectacular but adequate for a zombie flick.. just think back to Night of the Living Dead and remember how bad the acting was for those movies.Lastly, the major plot hole I noticed.  The movie shows that one of the blue vials were broken in the lab, the lab then sealed and locked.  Allright that's fine, but what I find disturbing, and this is after having worked in a level 5 capable lab environment, is that the virus could become airborne through the ventilation system.  Technically.. impossible.  There are so many filters and security measures in virus labs that it would be completely impossible for that virus to go airborne.  Even if the hive computer wanted it to.  You just can't turn off a filter.If you think about that, then there is no movie, they should have thought of another way to spread the virus, say.. through a plague of rats they were testing on or use the method that was used in 12 Monkeys.Overall: Great movie and a must see for video game fans or not.","

"Girl-nextdoor80","29 April 2006","love the resident evil games and I love the zombie films of Romero. I was really looking forward to a Resident Evil movie rumours had circulated for years about Romero directing and people like Robert Partric playing the key characters. Clearly Andersion wasn't interested in great things like that instead he thought he'd throw ""Aliens"",""2001"",""George A. Romero's Trilogy"" and a bit of ""The Matrix"" in a blender and see what comes out. I can't believe how bad this movie is first their is not one character from the original game in it instead a group of commandos with ridiculous names like One and Rain. 2nd the monsters, where are they? all their is are zombies(Key to the game of coarse) and a licker(Not even from Resident Evil it's from Resident Evil 2!). No sign of the hunters or the tyrant the two famous creatures from the first game. The platoon of commandos is such a rip off of the Marine corps from ""aliens"" right down to the tough soldier girl who doesn't take any crap (Played very annoyingly by Michele Rodreguize who also played the exact same character in the ""fast and the furious"" and ""Swat""). There are very few scenes that don't rip-off another film ""the Matrix"" rip-offs are probably the worst, watching ""Alice"" jump 6 feet in the air and karate kick a zombie dog in slow motion is absolutely ridiculous. What really rubs salt in the wounds is that George A. Romero(Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead) wrote a script for this and was going to direct. I've read his script it's so much better than this trash.","

"lgilbertom","16 August 2002","My comments there isn't exactly SPOILLERS but you was advised.
The basic plot-line is a great corporation has been developed a new virus and an ""accident"" occurs and the virus is free. The computer to avoid the virus spread, kill everyone in the base and there are only two survivors. A elite team is send to the installation and verify ""what a hell is going on"" and switch off the computer (because the computer kill everyone in the base of course). Well, the problems started because the computer dislike of the idea to be switch off, but this is only the beginning. The tone of the movie is Gothic and a little creepy and has a touch of ""matrix"". I explain, there is a sequence where the character of the Milla Jovovich kill some ""DOGS"" and a normal person NEVER does this things.These comments are enough to get a good idea of the movie, the actors works well, specially Milla, the special effects are very good. The some actions scenes are fast and brutal others has a creepy tone but are well worked. Ok, the script could be a little more elaborate but is good enough for this kind of movie.

Unknown to the world, it's success is due to a secret underground lab where viral weapons are tested and made. A new virus that the company created escapes, turning hundreds of scientists into flesh hungry zombies. The main computer shuts down the labs for risk of infection. A special task force is sent in to shut down the main computer and quarantine the deadly virus. What awaits them is beyond ordinary procedure......After seeing this with fresh eyes after nearly fourteen years, it's a wonder just to how this franchise has lasted for six, that's six movies.Aside from the admittedly impressive laser defence scene, the film consists of nothing more than incoherent flashbacks, terrible techno dance music that we all had to endure from films like this back in the late nineties/early Noughties, Rodriguez acting tough because of that films about cars, and dogs covered in jam.And then there is Jovovich, whom on hindsight does nothing more than scream, pout, run around in slow motion, and let her clothes fall off. It's a teen boys dream, but for everyone else, it's nothing more than a noisy, irritating mess, with a silly CGI beast at the end with a big tongue.It's a shame really, because I thought I like this when I first saw it, and I'm not looking forward to going back to the sequels because I thought they were silly, but had some camp value to them.Will there ever be a decent video game adaptation that isn't a guilty pleasure?","

"adrianparuliarana","11 January 2020","Milla Jovovich's role as Alice didn't make sense because we have no main characters by the name of Alice in the video games. At first it seemed to have no references to the first video game, until it shows a mansion. But after that in this film, we didn't really get to see many references, and the nemesis transformation near the end was unexpected and weird. Milla plays a huge role in ""Resident Evil"" and seems to be having fun while filming. The zombies in this film are pretty close to the video games, and the feature of the licker was good too.","

The movie is about a virus which disrupts a company 's functioning and threatens the people working over there. Its an excellent film. It keeps you on the edge of the seat all the time. Milla Jovovich is amazing as usual.She is a very good actress.Its a must see for all those Sci-Fi fans.","

"PlanecrazyIkarus","13 July 2002","Somewhere I've read that this movie was ""yet another videogame adaptation with even less plot than Tomb Raider""... Actually, that statement is wrong.Yes, it is a videogame adaptation (of a game I never plaid), and it shows. The ""Hive""? Linear plot development on a mission basis (Find the queen - kill the queen - fight the zombies - try to escape -.....)? Creatures just oozing that special air of ""level end boss""? (The Queen, The fellow right at the end, maybe even the dogs).. Yup - it's a videogame alright.But, surprisingly, it is FUN to watch! The plot may be a bit thin - but unlike the pile of bulldung that Tomb Raider had for a story, this movie actually has a lot more charme and skill worked into its storytelling. Of course, it's still far from a proper thriller/drama, but I'd say it isn't too inferior to ""Aliens"" on the level of its storytelling. Definitely superior to Blade 2 - another movie with similar elements.On a visual level, this movie is pure joy. Vibrant colours, amazing creature effects, utterly scary Doberman dogs - yup! These visuals rock! And the action, too, is brilliant, although a few more kung-fu-esque kicking sequences would have been needed. The entry hall to the queen's chamber is definitely an impressive piece of action cinema, perhaps even the best of the movie, although it's a close call. The soundtrack underlines the action, and it fits superbly. If you have seen ""House on Haunted Hill"" it will sound similar, and it definitely enriches the movie.All in all, this is a great summer action movie, looking like a mixture of Night of the Living Dead and Blade 2 - but being better than both at satisfying my tastes. Fun. Fun. Fun.And the ending is very cool, too.....8/10","

"koolkidjohnny","28 March 2002","Okay, pay no attention to the 7.0 rating. If you have any good taste and think good movies have to have actual plots, actual characters, and some decent dialogue, do not see this movie, because it's horrible.The main actors in this movie have done much better work (Milla: 5th element, Michele: girlfight), and everyone else in the movie was pretty much just there to be killed or take up space. There weren't exactly charcters. I didn't even catch any of their names. There was hardly any dialogue except for the usual ""What is that?!"" or the pathetic comedic one liners from Michele. We learn absolutely nothing about the characters themself, because, once again they weren't characters.OK OK I know that's alot to expect from a video game adaption (is it though?). I mean, going into see this movie I was at least hoping for some decent zombie stuff to happen. But there was nothing! The zombies looked like people picked up off the street, covered in flour and ketchup and told to scream at milla jovovich. Even the computer generated thing that got out from it's cage, whatever it was, was pretty bad looking, not a memorable creature at all.So basically it all adds up to this: Pretty much everything in this movie has been done before AND better:Zombies: ""Dead Alive"", ""Evil Dead""; Butch Pretty Girl Heriones: ""Alien"", ""Terminater 2"";The Laser Sequence: ""Cube""; CGI Monsters: ""The Relic"", ""The Mummy"", ""Lord of the Rings"";Boring Characters (if you could call them that), Dull Plot, Bad Acting, Bad Editing, Bad Visual FX, Bad Dialogue... etc etc etc.HOWEVER I did like the dog sequence. The dogs were OK looking, and the whole slow motion kick was done pretty well I think. Only if they had more of that and better characters and zombies.4/10","

"pumpkinhead_lance","4 July 2005","I love this film. Paul Anderson is a great director. Bold statement I know. A lot of you will disagree with me and I will tell you that you are probably just one of those guys who have seriously jumped on the bandwagon. Because that's basically all that it's amounted to. Paul Anderson has had the opportunity to direct films that have a extremely high expectancy level to them. And this alone is probably the reason he is lambasted so. Because no one can live up to a lot of fan boys expectations.I myself am a fan boy, but I'm an open minded and not such a nit-picky one.Anderson really knows how to construct a movie and tell a story quite well. The scares in this flick are anything but cliché. He knows how to scare us by providing an extremely high level of suspense.The gore is low, and that is my main problem with the film. It's based on a video game that has buckets of it. There is some though. It isn't completely bloodless. But at least there is plenty of suspense and terrific action sequences. In the end that's what really matters.Everything else though works completely. We are introduced to characters we genuinely care about and are sad to see it when they ultimately meet their untimely demise.The special effects are terrific and the music by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson is pulsating, creepy, and very unsettling.It's a superior horror film that I highly recommend.","

"jwerwin80","2 September 2002","The basic idea for this movie is pretty cool, and visually the movie is engaging. Unfortunately, it looks like they spent all their money on visual effects and creating a cool look, and nothing on the script. One of the basic rules of story telling is show, don't tell. Most of scenes involve the characters standing around explaining to each other (i.e. explaining to us in the audience) what is happening. This makes the story move incredibly slow.The most interesting part of the story is how Alice (Milla Jovovich) has lost her memory. She knows that she's directly involved somehow, but doesn't know what she's done. Unfortunately she never reveals much about herself, so we don't get to know her enough to care about her. There are a couple of very awkward partial nude scenes that look painfully like the producers wanted to show Jovovich naked and she wouldn't play ball.
This one really isn't worth the effort. The action scenes are few and far between, and aren't very well done. The story is so painfully slow that it seems to take forever to get started, and never really delivers enough energy to put you on the edge of your seat. It's really a shame because there are some very cool plot elements to the story, but it's just so poorly written that you're left wondering what this movie could have been if it had been given to a capable writer.","

"sweetKLP4","10 August 2003","This is a good SCIFI movie. But I watched the Movie ""28 days later"" before I've seen this movie. As I saw both ""Resident Evil"" and ""28 days later"" the plot seemed so a like. Unlike the movie ""28 days later"", ""Resident Evil"" took place with a bad virus spreading in a building (and not all England) making people that is infected with the virus want to eat other people to stay alive. As one bite reaches one person, they will soon become infected. My favorite part in this movie was that when that blond lady runs into the crazed dogs and Kicks major ass. That was cool, I wish they showed an instant replay of her kicking those dogs butts. Especailly when she kicks one of them one room through the other room, breaking the glass. I know there is a game based on this movie. I never played the game, but the movie looks better. I hope there is a sequil to this movie. I rate this movie ***","

"gonzoriffic","15 March 2002","people had been bad-mouthing this movie before it was even released. it came out today, i saw it, and i thought it kicked a lot of ass. REALLY. years ago, director george romero was attatched to direct this film, but either he couldn't get it together or his script wasn't good enough and they decided not to go with him as director. as a longtime horror/zombie movie fan, let me just say that romero already put his stamp on material like this when he made DAY OF THE DEAD in the 80s (which has a lot in common with RESIDENT EVIL in terms of setting, atmosphere, characters, plot, and general tome) and there'd be no point in him directing this type of film again. that said, i think director paul anderson has done an incredible job directing this movie! it is tense, scary, unrelenting, and moves along at a perfect pace. his previous film SOLDIER (with kurt russell) is highly underrated, you should check it out. milla jovovich and michelle rodriguez are both wonderful in RESIDENT as well, i liked them both quite a bit. this is the first movie based on a video game that i actually enjoyed, and i hope it gets a sequel fast. my only complaint is the computer-generated effects, which get ridiculously overused (come on, zombies don't need CGI makeup, just call tom savini). perhaps with more $$$ this can be remedied if they make another...and anyone who sees this & likes it will be begging for part 2.","

"eke826s","19 March 2002","It's been quite a while since I first heard of the Resident Evil movie. Back when George Romero was writing a script, and Samatha Mathis from Broken Arrow was going to play Jill Valentine with Bruce Payne as Wesker, I was excited.  Then things seemed to fall apart and the project was in my mind trashed.Slowly things came back together.  A new writer, director, cast, and so on help to bring my confidence back.  Even though the cast seemed to lack a little bit, and the characters were not the same, I was still excited to see the movie when it finally came out this past Friday.Although I understand this could not be considered a great movie, I was very much satisfied with the transfer to film of one of the greatest video games ever made.  I was disappointed with the changed characters, but the story was very much there.  And the special effects and gore were excellent.  I was especially impressed with the dogs in how closely they resembled what you see in the game.Needless to say I was happy with the results, and look forward to the sequel.  If it's anything like the video game series, it only gets better.9/10","

"The_Missus","11 July 2002","(May Contain Spoilers)Alice is a happily married woman, living in a beautiful mansion in Racoon City.. at least that's what the outside world is lead to believe.. In truth, he marriage is a sham, she is an undercover agent for the Umbrella corporation, and so is her ""husband"", they have been placed in the mansion to guard the secret entrance to Umbrella's top secret research lab the Hive.. unfortunately, Alice can't remember any of this, she has amnesia.The film follows Alice and a team of soldiers going into the Hive to find out what happened to the scientists who lived and worked there, and Alice slowly begins to remember who she really is and what her real agenda is. The team soon discover that strange things were going on down there, and the scientists may not be quite as dead as they thought...The special effects are great, and the sound-track really works well with the action, and hightens the intensity of certain moments in the film. Comparisons have to be made with certain George A Romero films, especially Day of The Dead, and of course many watch it and judge it on the basis of it's connection to the Resi Evil games, but forget about all that, and just go in to the film with no pre-conceptions. A lot of people didn't like this film, but watch it as a no brainer action film with some great effects andyou'll have fun.","

"voodoobeaver","17 March 2002","As much as I enjoy high-brow cinema, I also have a soft spot in my heart for shoot-em-up SF escapism.In my mind, ""Aliens"" from 1986 is still the best jump-off-your-seat SF scarefest of recent history.  ""Resident Evil"" doesn't even come close to the level of techno-thriller expertise of that older movie.BUT: Resident Evil is a lot of fun, and should please many zombie fans.  The story is a treatment of the classic zombie formula: trap some unwitting people in a closed system with flesh-eating dead people. Add some action sequences, some people-muching gore, and a couple of motivation twists to make it spicier, and you have the usual zombie stew.What makes this better than a C-movie Romero flick is the special effects wizardry, and a little more character texture than most Saturday afternoon zombie flicks.If you're looking for some fun B-movie escapism, and don't mind a couple of slower scenes, then you should enjoy this flick.  I can't say I want to run out and buy the video game now, but I certainly did get some good jumps and good ""grosssssss...!"" factor from Resident Evil.3 stars out of 5.
p.s. I thought ""Tremors"" and ""Deep Blue Sea"" were even more fun than Resident Evil.","

"andymike-75725","7 October 2018","I recently rewatched this movie and found myself once again enjoying it more than i thought i would. It is a competent survival movie where a group of people have to escape an underground deathtrap with a crazy AI, zombies and worse. It is cheesy but it is also good fun. The movie have a lot of twists and turns in it but it somehow manages to stay reasonable coherent considering all of the elements it mixes into the story from a killer AI, zombies, monsters, amnesia, conspiracies, betrayals and more.I think that the actors did a good job with what they were given and i found myself really warming up to the remaining military guys. Its a shame that they died so abruptly at the end of the movie. With all of this said i would not recommend this movie to just anyone. It is certainly not on my ""must see"" list and i would not recommend it to anyone who is not a fan of the genre. It is a movie that is well worth spending an evening watching if you like cheesy, goofy survival action movies. If that is not your thing then you can probably forgot about this movie without any worries.","

Wing Commander), Resident Evil is so close of the game that it scared me more than the nasties on the screen. Okay, so the plot is a tad thin, and the memory loss thing is just a bit too convenient, nevertheless I enjoyed the rollercoaster ride that this movie provided.In a nutshell its blood, gore, sexy ladies and damn nasty zombies. The movied played out as nicely as the game and so I figured it was a good way to spend a almostly drizzly afternoon.8/10.","

And having finished watching it, I also realised that I had not yet seen any of the subsequent movies (for some reason I thought I had).Anyway, of course Milla Jovovich is a rockin' chick when it comes to action movies, but I love Michelle Rodriguez as well.

"Marlxton","26 March 2023","""Resident Evil"" is a 2002 horror film directed by Paul W. S. Anderson and starring Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, and Eric Mabius. As a big fan of zombie movies, I have to say that this film is one of my all-time favorites. I've watched it five times now, and it never gets boring.The film is based on the popular video game series of the same name, and it does an excellent job of capturing the essence of the games while still being its own thing. The atmosphere is creepy and tense, and the action scenes are thrilling and well-choreographed.One of the things I appreciate most about the film is the attention to detail. From the costumes to the sets, everything feels authentic and well thought out. The zombies are particularly well done, with their grotesque appearances and unsettling movements.The cast is also superb, with each actor bringing something unique to their role. Milla Jovovich is fantastic as the lead character Alice, and Michelle Rodriguez is equally impressive as Rain. Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, and Colin Salmon round out the cast with strong performances of their own.Overall, ""Resident Evil"" is a must-see for fans of horror and zombie movies. It's a well-crafted film that pays homage to the source material while still standing on its own. Highly recommended!","

"badfeelinganger","11 October 2014","It is to writer/director Paul Anderson's credit that he retains the tension throughout. I don't quite understand why this thing received such crappy reviews when it was released five years ago as I found 'Resident Evil' to be real creepy fun entertainment. I am aware that director Paul W. S. Anderson doesn't get a hell of a lot of love out there and is the brunt of many a scornful comment but with RE (that's what those of us in know call it) he has crafted a true zombie horror film that has an eerie ominous feel throughout, some legitimate jump out of your seat moments, plenty of blood and gore for those who like that kind thing and of course Milla is jumping around, scaling walls and kicking much zombie ass.Resident Evil may be empty, but it is still a lot of fun. It avoids being a tired sub-genre film by being so many sub-genres at once. It's a zombie film, a creature feature, a disaster film, a spy movie, an escape film, a sci-fi evil computer picture, an anti-corporate diatribe, and a disease flick. And more than any of those, it's an adventure movie. What's surprising is that they are all done right. The pacing is nearly perfect, keeping things always moving, but never too fast to miss plot points or character development. The music keeps the tension high. The fights are exciting. And I found myself caring about Alice. It doesn't hurt that she's played by Milla Jovovich who looks stunning and moves like a cat. But then, the entire film looks good. It's worth watching once just to study the colours. No one will be discussing philosophy after watching Resident Evil, but sometimes, that's OK. You will be entertained.Followed by Resident Evil: Apocalypse.","

"a05102267","7 October 2010","Many reviewers consider this to be one the best adaptations of a video game into a film...Well, I have to disagree, mostly because I love all the Resident Evil games, and even when this is much better than things such as ""Doom"" or ""Bloodrayne"", it is just doesn't make any justice to the original games in which this movie is inspired.This film betrays the original roots of the game, focusing in the action rather than the horror parts (Sure: The games had lots of action, but also had lots of thrills, mystery and subtlety, something that this film completely lacks) The other problem with this film is the terrible direction of Paul W.S. Anderson, which ruins a great story, turning the whole thing into a huge mess that is barely watchable. As a movie independent of the games, it is mediocre at best. But as an adaptation it is just terrible, dreadful film.","

"plu4085","6 February 2006","I was really disappointed with this movie, which had a pretty good reputation and ""buzz"" upon release. It started out well, but about 30 minutes into it a feeling of cheesiness came creeping over me. There were just too much illogical behavior, sloppy acting and derivative ideas that the original promise fell apart. This continued throughout the movie, so that towards the end I pretty much hated it.Some nice visual touches and an interesting premise, but all the movies it rips off -- Aliens, the Romero zombie trilogy, Outbreak, The Relic, etc -- are better than this, which adds to the exploitation feeling. The lead characters are unsympathetic or incomprehensible, and given no support by the weak actors.This movie follows the exact same pattern and weaknesses as Anderson's ""Event Horizon"", which however suffered less from its problems.","

"HoraceBury","15 July 2002","Ok, there is nothing original about this film, but, as with a number of films being made recently, it can somtimes look original because of the recent love with computer graphics and eye-pleasing cleanliness of of recent movies.Milla looks great and proves herself once again, even if there is little clothing or script available sometimes.  Some might say that she was a little too undressed for the film's rating, (but I reserve opinion as I like to think I'm well balanced enough not to be affected).The action is very cool; violence equally so - although some taken (come on guys, admit it) straight from the excellent, minor cult movie 'Cube'.  My only grudge on the sfx and action is that we could have seen the hologram a bit more.  My only grudge on the storyline is that it was asking me to stretch my disbelief almost that bit too far, which even I can do quite frequently.All in all, I now realise they may have been saving a bit of the budget for the sequel - which I hope lives up to it's future hype.  I must congratulate the script writers, sfx guys and actors for a job well done, considering game-to-movie conversions have not faired so well (see the excellent 'Wing Commander' - yes, I stand by that).","

Then again there has not been to many in this genre, one such attempt was Tomb Raider and the Movie was horrible. Anyways this movie has a great story line and a original idea for the enemy in the film. Special effects were another strong point of this film(especially the laser scene). But despite all the things that Resident Evil did well on the screen there were a few weak points. One area being the cast, I believe there could have been a stronger cast constructed for the film, not that the cast for Resident Evil did a bad job but I just personally believe it could have been done better. And if your a Resident Evil video game fan which I am, I was a little angry with the fact that the movie sort of did a combination of the first and second Resident Evil Games, I personally believe that they should have made two separate movies because the games had such great story lines, but with that said Resident Evil did a great job overall and I can't wait to Resident Evil: Nemesis. - R.F. 2003","

"brandonennals","17 December 2004","almost just like comic book movies. Everyone has their own interpretation of what they think the movie should be like and what they really like about the games differs too. The things I like about this movie is Milla, zombies, and guns. The things I don't like about this movie is the story could have been better. The screenplay could have been better. And especially the Lickers, they should have been better. I'm really not really a big Licker fan, I would have rather have seen Hunters instead. Either way, the lickers were a little weak, but they definitely made an effort to improve the Lickers in the sequel. I really don't like zombie dogs. You mean a zombie man cannot run, but a dog can? Makes no sense. I understand this movie was also made to set the stage for other future movies and sometimes I hate that. I love for each movie to tell its own story without having to worry about leaving something for later. The scene with the laser security system was cool, reminded me of the cool scene in Ghost Ship. This movie is okay to watch from time to time, but its really something that I wont watch more than once every few months. I love zombie movies but I have others that are better than this. I'm only half way through the second RE, but once I am done, I will post my feelings on this too.","

"ScottyJBD","16 March 2002","Im a big Resident Evil fan and when i first heard about the plot, i had low expectations, but as time when on, i was sure it would be a great movieI went into the theatre with great expectations and i wasnt disappointed at all, it doesnt follow the game at all, but in a way it does, and it does it very well.I am very proud of what Anderson has done and i hope this is his big break into making more movies.","

"christopher-45","28 July 2002","Having never played the game myself, I didn't quite know what the film would be like, but I quite enjoyed it. Milla Jovovich apart from being beautiful is now the holder of the Sigourney Weaver title of female bad guy ass kicker, and she dominates the sceen when ever she is on it as I couldn't take my eyes off her, and Michelle Rodriguez as the fiesty Rain was using her trade mark pout to maximum effect.On the negative side, the Zombies just were just not scary, and Ive seen better horror makeup in other films, one zombie I noticed was trying very hard not to laugh, and the sceen in the tunnel gave me the feeling the zombie gang, were all waiting off sceen ready for the director to say go before they all joined the shot.  The laser guard was good, and its special gory effects was good but the final laser victim of the traditional black man victim death was a waste of the best of the supporting characters, and was to brief to be really shocking, but this was understandable given the films British 15 certificate.  The zombie dogs though were good, and even gave me at 45 years old a start, and the way Milla took care of them, was in tune with the films source for action, well done Milla.As for the super baddie licker dog, it was all a bit fast in the train to get a real good look at it, but it gave off enough evil intent to be the best of the baddies.The ending sceen was really good, but before that who was the person walking across the screen before Milla escapes from the hospital, one of the crew? The final panoramic sceen sets the tone nicely for a sequel that I'll probably be going to see.Verdict, just enough gore, a reasonable adherance to the game play, and the lovely Milla Jovovich, showing lots of flesh and kicking zombie ass.","

"ellis_craig","10 October 2003","Excellent story line and good casting. Watched the DVD version, thought that perhaps not that much gore but it didn't spoil the film. I liked the ending and i guess the film 28 days later can continue the story (maybe?). Resident Evil 2 hopefully should be good.","

"hitchcockthelegend","12 August 2011","A virus has turned the workers at an Umbrella Corporation HQ in to the snarling undead. Enter a crack team of commandos to lay waste wherever possible. But with a super-computer running the show and mistrust and amnesia gripping the surviving humans, it's a mission fraught with peril at every turn. How many good game adaptations to screen can you name? Of course the answer to this will depend on your age, love of the genre-sub-genre, games and how easily pleased you are. That Resident Evil has to date spawned four sequels, suggests that there's a target audience lapping it up. Why? I have no idea, going on this first film it's a wonder all those involved wasn't locked away in some Hive facility of their own to never be let out ever again.Though marginally better than the quite awful Tomb Raider adaptation, Resident Evil lacks atmosphere, shocks and a distinct lack of brain usage for the puzzles in the plot. Add in that it's totally predictable, the characters are dumb and that the creatures are like something Nick Park would make to scare his children, well it's not got much going for it. And that's before we think about dissecting the C grade cast of actors who are as muddled as the plotting is. Then the dialogue, oh dear oh dear, we don't expect Citizen Kane, but come on. Milla Jovovich at least earns her pay as an effective heroine, but under Paul W.S. Anderson's direction she's only really dressed up to please horny teenage boys, with one ""money"" shot thrown in by way of desperation one feels. 3/10 for Milla's spunky bravado, Colin Salmon's bemusement at being in such trash and the unnerving AI: Red Queen who out acts all of the cast.","

"waari","1 October 2002","I would have to say that this goes well in the same category like Plan nine from outer space, basicly a neat idea with horrible execution. This movie must be cool if you are like 13 years old and enjoy the games, for all others, dont bother. The plot has more loopholes than swiss cheese, acting is so-so, I counted at least five encounters in the movie where the microphone used in production is clearly visible ... shame shame ... Good idea, terrible movie, dont waste your money.","

"RyanEberhart","27 August 2013","For those of you that played the video game of Resident Evil I am sure you had a lot of fun playing. Unfortunately, I don't think I ever did play the game, at least not outside of an arcade version. Certainly not on Playstation or Sega or Nintendo. Yes, I am that old.Anyway, I love these movies. There is not any one part of any of these movies I don't like. If I could watch them all the time I would. Not because of the walking dead, but because Milla Yovovich is hot! It doesn't hurt that we see Milla almost nude a couple of times and there is a nipple glimpse; I won't call it a nipple slip, it was there on purpose.Anyway, like I said, there is literally nothing about any of the Resident Evil movies I don't like. However, as has become my custom in my reviews I have to list my all time favorite scenes. There are three I absolutely love.The first is the scene where the group of soldiers along with Alice (Milla Yovovich) and Spence (James Purefoy) attempt to turn off the Red Queen. Four of the soldiers enter a corridor which leads to the Red Queen's mainframe; after opening the door to her mainframe, the Red Queen closes the doors at both ends and traps the four soldiers. The Red Queen activates her defenses, in the form of lasers; first one that travels along one line, then one that moves up and down depending on if the soldier jumps or crouches, and finally a laser that turns into a grid and slices through the last soldier.I like a lot of the scenes where Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) is the macho soldier. At one point she tells another character to ""blow her"", hilarious. Several scenes into the movie after being bit, Rain is taunting the zombies by dripping blood from a wound in her hand down from pipes the group (Alice, Rain, Spence, Matt and Kaplan) is crawling along.The second scene I like is when the remaining members of the group, minus Kaplan, figure our that Spence is the one who released the T- Virus. Alice attempts to stop Spence's escape but he does so anyway, after a long speech how he did everything for Alice. In the end Alice doesn't buy anything that Spence says and he leaves. But Spence doesn't get far. He is soon killed by a Licker, a mutated monster that is hunting the survivors.The final scene I like is when the Licker attacks the train as the survivors are trying to make their way out of the Hive and the Mansion. The Licker claws it's way to the control end of the train, scratching Matt's arm in the process. When it reaches the controls of the train it attacks Kaplan and kills him, then goes after Alice, Matt and Rain. While Alice and Matt are fighting the Licker, Rain finally turns into a zombie. Now Alice and Matt have to fight the Licker and Rain. Alice traps the Licker's tongue with a pipe and stabs it with another pipe trapping it, yelling to Matt to open the doors to the undercarriage. Matt does this by shooting Rain in the forehead forcing her back into the button for the doors. The Licker falls through the door and from the electricity of the third rail catches fire. Alice closes the doors and cuts the tongue of the Licker letting it tumble away from the train.I said it before, and I'll say it again. I love these movies. I give this one 10 stars out of 10.","

"SPaS","11 January 2003","I would have LOVED to see G.A. Romero make a comeback with a ""Resident Evil"" movie: zombies are his territory and he would have been able to pull some depth to it. Everything would have clicked, sure hit.INSTEAD, the producers handed R.E. to Paul ""I've only directed flops"" Anderson who (as we all saw) had NO originality and NO perception for this matter whatsoever. His approach reminded me of that such of a kid's in a candy store: ""ooh we got to squeeze in these cool elements (the train, the dogs, the monster in the end) from the game, and we got to put in some matrix-type action and ooh I saw this cool death-scene in the beginning of ""Cube"" and, and... oh yeah, we need a talking computer! With a hologram!""""Excuse me, mr. Anderson, but we can't fit them all into a 90-minute movie""""SURE WE CAN! We just cut the suspense and the zombie on-screen time!""Yeah. Of a zombie horror movie. I don't think RE was all that bad though, a 5 out of 10 = watchable.It just p***es me off that the producers don't seem to be taking us ""old school"" horror fans seriously. I mean, would hiring Romero have been too big an investment? Or didn't they want the material be too controversial? With Romero this could of NOT have been less than a 7 out of 10 movie! Probably even a new ""Dawn OTD""...? Definitely something to give MPAA and purists gray hair, for a long time :)What saddens me furthermore is, they'll (the producers) most likely end up screwing the upcoming Jason vs. Freddy all over: ""Hey guys, we could save 10c by rewriting Alice and Tommy off! I mean, who remembers them anyway? And while we're at it, let's change Robert Englund with another actor, C'MON, NO-ONE WILL NOTICE!"" Go ahead, make it a PG-13 movie while you are at it, to attract more viewers to it.","

"brandonsites1981","3 September 2002","-My number 2 pick for best film of the year as of now over films like Road to Perdition, Signs, and My Big Fat Greek Wedding.Exciting adaption of the video game finds a group of soldiers led by Alice (Milla Jovovich) sent to an under ground lab to contain a deadly virus that re-animates the living dead and having to deal with an out of control monster and an annoying computer. Fast paced thriller with a well chosen cast, especially Milla, and stunning sets and production design. What it lacks in character development, it more then makes up for it in terms of sheer excitement and scares. The ending is a knockout!Rated R; Extreme Violence, Profanity, and Brief Nudity.","

"zumajay","12 April 2003","You know... it's always hard for fans of one media watch their beloved characters/story line be warped into the big screen.So many comic books turned film have been God-awful... The Punisher, Captain America, Superman, Batman... they never captured the essence of the comic book.  We needed a director like Martin Scorsese to direct Batman.  The good thing is, films based off of comic books have finally come of age with the coming of Spider-Man, X-Men... and hopefully The Hulk.Video games turned films seem to just be in it's infancy.  We had Super Mario Bros.  Ugh.  Street Fighter?  Ouch (RIP, Raul Julia... that should not have been your last film)!  But hey, Resident Evil wasn't bad!!  And look, Silent Hill is on the horizon!!  I think video game films will only get better and better from here!!Besides, Milla looked great in this flick!","

"IsmaRubio","30 June 2002","I am charmed with this movie. it is perfect because to me I am a fanatic of the cinema gore and of terror in general, and also fan of the violent, such video games as the saga RESIDENT EVIL.From beginning until the end, everything is an entertainment, violently, effective, very rapidly and very terrifying. To the beginning of the movie someone (who is not known the one who is until the end of the movie), voluntarily infected with a mortal virus, one makes of Umbrella's experimentation (the major company of the world), called ""the beehive"". All the personnel die agonizing, after moments, bit a bit, and ""the beehive"" remains inactive. There appears Alice (Mile J.) in the shower of the bath, but she does not remember anything of anything. The mansion appears where she lives (identical to that of the video game RESIDENT EVIL 1) and on having tried to go out of the mansion, someone her enters again in the house by force (the first fright). He is Matt Adison. The group of commands appear rapidly, breaking the windows of the mansion. The group of commandos this one led by the commander James (Colin Samon), and formed principally by Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), Kaplan, Salinas, and Medic. The commandos interrogate Matt, he says to them that he is a policeman of Raccon city. nonetheless they take him as a prisoner. Rapidly, and without explanations, the commander directs to the whole group towards a secret door that gives to a species of underground. There in the underground stores (identical to those of a real video game) on having come to the train that joins the mansion with the beehive, they find Spencer Praks (James P.), who also suffers of amnesia.He is the supposed husband of Alice. From this moment, both, Alice and Spencer remember during the whole movie, bit a bit, recovering the memory. The whole group goes in train up to ""the beehive"". There they discover that quite this solitary, and the commandos put hands to the work your mission. They speak about the beehive and of the computer that directs everything and that supposedly madman has turned, the so called red queen. Immediately, the commander James and three commandos more, remain caught in a trap. Enclosed in a corridor, a red laser them is departing from one in one (first, medic loses the head, after another the fingers of the hand, another commando is departed in two, and finally the commander is he throw thousand pieces). After this unexpected event (and very gore), Alice and the demas, safely someone already, deactivate the red queen (the first appearance of the girl). On the other hand, Rain and two commandos more, together with Matt of prisoner, discover a woman zombie (the first walking zombie, exactly at the half hour of the movie). The zombie attacks and bites Rain, and the whole loader shoots this one, but the bush. There joins to the group Alice and the others, and appears zombies for all sites, surrounding them. There is a great gunfire, but the commandos do not manage to kill to anybody zombie. They all try to escape, and ultimately after the alone holocaust they remain alive, Alice, Matt, Rain, Kaplan, and Spencer. Matt manages to escape of his captivity and avoids to the offices. Matt, discovers your sister, Liza, but it is a zombie. Alice fights against the doberman zombie (killing all spectacularly). Alice kills to Combat, and Matt tells Alice who is a secret agent with the aim to unmask Umbrella's company and extracting to the light your secret experiments.From these events, more zombies and spectacular situations. Alice reveals herself to if same she turns into the real heroine of the movie. In the distance to your destiny, Rain is attacked and bitten often by some zombies. They all come to Umbrella's laboratory and there there discovers the reality of the plot of the movie (Spencer's real role is explained to us, that in the end, it is the wicked one of the movie). Spencer betrays Alice, and makes all enclosed. Giant appears the monster zombie and one eats it. The red queen makes clear that Rain must die in order that the demas survive, but Alice does not want to kill her. There appears Kaplan, to which him believe dead man, and he saves to all. The monster zombie giant chases them. They come to the train and there this one Spencer, dead man. He turns in zombie and Alice murders it of a palazo in the head. They ignite in train and flee. Alice gives the antidote against the virus to Rain (that this very bad). Appears again, the monster zombie giant and kills Kaplan. Alice and Matt try to kill it but they cannot. Matt is hurt by the monster. Rain turns in zombie and attacks Matt. Matt kills Rain, and drives also a button in order that the monster zombie giant is destroyed against the route of train.Matt and Alice are saved, and are the surviving only ones. On having come to the mansion, Matt's wound begins to mutar, and Alice scares. They appear suddenly, a few rare types and they remove them to the two by force. One of the doctors says: "" we will put him in the project NEMESIS "". Alice remains incoscient. After a relax, Alice wakes up in a room of operations. Alone this one. There is nobody. Quite this desert. she goes out from the hospital to the street. There the great this desolate avenue, and everything looks like a chaos, as if a catastrophe had happened. A newspaper says: "" the dead men walk!! "". Alice takes a shotgun of a car policeman, and wait .... soon the second part, RESIDENT EVIL ""NEMESIS""",NA
"daffyphack","22 March 2002","Bollicks to you, Glacier.  You talk as if a midget with brass knuckles was punching you in the balls during the duration of the movie.  I'll agree with anyone who says this film wasn't art, but it was NOT a bad movie.  I'm not gonna nominate it for an Oscar, but it was entertaining, and much more so than ""Tomb Raider."" And before we get into the ""you don't know the game"" issue, let it be known that I am a diehard fanatic of the Resident Evil series, having played all of the games, owning two, and having beaten both ""2"" and ""Veronica"".  The game itself consists of walking around rooms being frightened by sounds, and very often there isn't much zombie fighting involved.  Granted, ninja kicks to the heads of Dobermans forced my eyebrow to rise a little, but I let it pass, especially once they showed the Licker (only complaint I have is that such a weak character would be made into the ""boss"").  The special effects weren't great, and I found myself chuckling to myself at the sight of the zombies, but what got me into the film was the constant ambience.  It played just like the game, with more moments where you're scared of the silence than gunplay against approaching zombies.  As for accuracy to the game, it's not all there (if it was, they'd be able to hold eight guns at a time, and eat plants to cure their wounds), but as it is a prequel, it doesn't have much to stick to anyway.  The beginning introductions were accurate, and the ending was seamless, as well as being extremely creepy. And while I had expected to hate this movie, as video game transitions typically suck eggs (i.e. Super Mario Bros), I was very pleasantly surprised, and while I can't repeat enough that I wasn't blown away by the depth or artistry involved with the film, it was a good, mindless, lets-shoot-the-hell-out-of-some-zombies movie.  And if this series which seems like it's gonna sprout is true AND chronological, it's only gonna get cooler.  Anyone who remembers a specific line from the end of the movie, and knows what it's referring to...you know I'm right.",NA
"DesertDogMedia","5 August 2014","Title: Resident EvilCondensed Storyline: A special militaristic unit has to make their way through an underground base to shut off a supercomputer, but first they must get through the base which is full of zombies Notable Acting: I found most of the characters quite boring and as soon as I was starting to get invested in a character, they got killed off. I found Milla Jovovich's character Alice quite boring and bland, whereas I did like Eric Mabius' and Martin Crewes' characters of Mat and Kaplan. But that was really, just about it. Noticeable Camera work: Zoom in shot of a man using transportation hands to get the T-Virus and T-Vaccine, they work this so you can only see it is a man in a Hazmat suit, but you cannot see his face. Simple yet effective. Graphics: CGI monster that looks like Venom from Spiderman, bluntly looks CGI. I wish I could say more things about it, as it does look like a cool design. But there isn't much good I can say about it. Incorrect Science: The Red Queen tells the group that hair and fingernails continue to grow after death, this is incorrect as what actually happens is the skin around the nails and hair shrinks as it dehydrates, causing the hair and finger nails to look like they've grown. At the start of the movie when the T-Virus vial is dropped and escapes into the air vent, this is incorrect again as any lab that would have people working in hazmat suits wouldn't have an air vent, just like the scientist says when he is about to drown. I highly doubt dogs can smell the T-Virus, but you never know.Overall Feel: I am generally not a fan of video game movies, primarily because I feel like I would be missing out on a lot of easter egg and jokes, almost similar to comic book movies. But I actually know things about comic book movies so I don't feel left out. But thankfully, I didn't feel ""too"" left out while watching this movie as it felt more like a cut and print action movie more than a video game based movie.",NA

The main focus, as it appeared to me, was a First Person Shooter (FPS) in REAL life. While watching, I kept thinking about how I was feeling the same sensations as when I played an intense gaming session. The game Thief had me nervous at many corners, this movie did that too.

"shannon1fan","5 August 2002","As most people who saw this movie, I am a huge fan of the game! Now, in a video game, it's okay to have puzzles and power-ups and going from one room to another and getting a headache from all the damn searching.When news came that the movie was coming out boy was I excited. Rumors went around that it would take place in the mansion throughout and like the game, take you down into the labs. Thinking it over, that would've made the movie stupid. Think about it. Going from room to room to room searching for a puzzle piece to move that fireplace blocking the extra ammo. That is stupid!!!! But taking place in the Hive itself...there ya go! Reading some reviews people are complaining about the lack of puzzles and herbs. Okay there WAS a puzzle in the movie!!!!SPOILER!When Kaplan is trying to open the door to the Queen's Chamber and trying deactivate the weapon defense system.END SPOILERThis movie get ass. Mila in a skimpy outfit kicking the crap out of dogs and zombies and whatnot. Hundreds of zombies and zombie dogs, a giant ""Licker"" and a super computer that's trying to kill you. What more do you want?! The movie had sick but oh-so-amazing death scenes and monsters.I expected half the people who died to live on! What a surprise! This movie couldn't have been any better.

"TheHande","2 December 2005","Rewritten on: 10.9.06Let's get one thing straight. This film is not a horror-movie. Horror-movies are lame. Resident Evil is anything but lame.Almost everything about this movie is excellent. The atmosphere kicks ass and the movie has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. The over-all feeling is rather abstract, but not so much that it would make the film difficult to follow.This film is also not a Zombie-movie in the traditional sense, but more like an action-thriller...with zombies. As far as movie-monsters go the Licker was a great piece of work, even if in the earlier scenes it was a little dumpy-looking. The only other notable point that I may criticize is that up to the halfway point of the film it perhaps attempted too many times to startle the viewers which seemed a little goofy.As a final note, the ending crawl is one of the best I've seen in any film to date. Even if the film's plot (which I felt was on par with the games) is nowhere near as good as in Silent Hill, this is still my personal favorite on the front of video-game films.",NA
"jbhard","2 July 2005","As a fan of both George Romero's films and the original video games I found this movie to be horrible. No, I don't expect every film based on a game (or a book) to be identical to the source material. What's wrong with this film is what's been wrong with movies (especially horror) for the last fifteen years. It caters to the short attention spanned. Quick and illogical cuts peppered with bad camera tricks took me right out of this movie. One minute someone is on the ground surrounded by undead, the next he is 'edited' up onto his feet and running for his life. HUH?I thought the 1940's and 1950's had it bad with Abbott and Costello running the Universal monsters into the ground. Hey, at least their films were INTENTIONALLY funny. Resident Evil isn't even UNintentionally funny. So, with no humor, that leaves horror to carry the film, which it doesn't. Why? Because like most films of the last 15 years, it's all quick cut action with no suspense. Creating tension takes time and consistency, something most modern film makers don't seem to understand. This film plays like a commercial or a music video without music.Once again, the characters are completely unsympathetic. They say dumb things and they do dumb things. Once again, the 'modern' tough, smart, strong, cool, sexy female stomps all over the proceedings with muddy feet. SHE BOUNCES OFF A WALL AND KARATE KICKS ZOMBIE DOGS! Oooh! I'm so scared. I'm just not sure what to be scared of! I suppose I'm scared of seeing an equally appalling sequel.If you haven't seen this film - DON'T. This is 90 minutes you can never have back. In the age of DVD, there's a wealth of good horror to be found. Better yet, Video games are fast becoming better than modern films. Resident Evil the game and it's sequels (especially 4) out class this pile by miles.",NA
"asefn","15 March 2002","Whether you've played the game or not, this movie is it!  There's nothing like it!  The game was a classic for me.  If you are a fan of the game, you might be a little disappointed with the slight twist in the plot and different characters but believe you me, it doesn't take too long to get hooked on to these characters.  And the blond chick, i don't even know her name.  She was like whoa!  She rocks!This movie is the best guys.  I loved every moment of it! Amazing special effects!  Also, just so the fans of the game know, its a mixture of Resident Evil 1 and 2.  They give you a kind of prelogue to Resident Evil 3: Nemesis in the end which means that Nemesis is coming.  No mention of Code Veronica yet!  But my God!  Spine chilling, interesting, x-filey like!  Full of conspiracies and the hot chick!  A MUST see for all fans!  VERY entertaining for those who will get introduced to the idea for the first time!",NA
"FrankZZ","20 September 2002","In my opinion, this movie was an unfortunate waste of money for both, the viewer as well as the producers. You are better off watching one of the old original ""Zombie"" movies. I felt that the movie was packed with not necessarily impressive SFX to cover all the plot holes.

"PrimitiveScrewhead","16 December 2002","This is quite possibly the worse VideoGame Adaption I have ever seen. Paul Anderson has 'hacked' his way into the VideoGame market, and created a blatant cash-in film. This is more like a rip-off of The Matrix than anything else. I am a HUGE fan of the videogame series. The Resident Evil videogames are my favorite games of all time, but this movie is really that BAD. The film follows the storyline of a group of 'ALIENS' type Commandos being sent into a Mansion of some sort, where a deadly Virus outbreak has occured. On the way, they meet Alice, a person who has lost her mind. And.....to hell with it. This film basically has no plot, or even if it has, it has been poorly constructed. The thing about the Resident Evil games, is that they have strong plots which guide you in. You really get drawn into it. This film is incredibly bland. The acting is absolutely terrible, and cringe worthy. It totally lacks atmohpere which the VideoGames provide. Let's see a small comparison between the Film and the Videogame: FILM : Hard rock-type music. - VIDEOGAME : Eerie, quiet, orchestral score. FILM : Bullet Time. - VIDEOGAME : No Bullet-Time seen. FILM : Kung Fu. - VIDEOGAME : No Bullet time. FILM : Bland Characters. VIDEOGAME : Interesting characters.It clearly comes to my attention, this film bares more resemblance to The Matrix than the Videogames. All characters are new (and very bland and one dimensional). We don't know them, and we never do. It's very unbelievable how a film like this could mess up the Resident Evil saga. The videogames are just begging for a movie version of themselves, and instead, we get something that offers nothing in common with the videogames. It's hard to believe this film was 'based' on them. I don't even think it is. This film feels like 'deja vu', we've seen it all before.Capcom made the biggest mistake of letting Paul Anderson near the Resident Evil series. They also made the mistake of firing George A Romero. Sure, Romero's script changed a few ideas, but it stuck the closest to the videogames. Romero was the only man to do a faithful adaption. Hell, the Resident Evil videogames are based off his ZOMBIE trilogy.Avoid Resident Evil The Movie at all costs. If you want a slice of Resident Evil, stick with the VideoGames, as they are the true spirit of Resident Evil.

"LeathermanCraig","20 September 2004","Resident Evil just flat out kicks butt!The cast is a group of virtual unknowns... but they all are great actors and actresses, able to fall into their roles with believability....The action is TOP NOTCH - with lots of fighting and zombie action and running around and everything...SPOILERS MAY LIE BELOW - BE WARNED!!!When RED QUEEN, the computer of the Hive, in which Umbrella Corporation creates chemical and medical formulations, realizes that there has been a breech in security and that some of an experimental virus has gotten out, she does what any computer (read: uncaring intelligence) would do - kill any and all beings in the Hive and shut it down, not allowing anything (or anyone) to escape...Some of the deaths are just simple - using Halon or some other type of chemical, the oxygen is removed from rooms and people die.... or the room is flooded and people drown.... or the elevator drops hundreds of feet and crashes to the bottom of the shaft.... or it moves quickly, snapping the head off anybody stupid enough to poke it out the doors...Well, there are some drawbacks to the Red Queen's actions.... Including KILLING all of the people that work and live in the Hive.... And, as the deadly T-Virus is on the loose, which is chemically created to re-animate dead tissue, all of those same workers come back to life - with only the most basic of brain functions going - those that will keep them alive - breathing and eating... what do they eat?!? Living creatures.... Through this movie, we get an expansion on the Resident Evil video game series, giving us more back story into the T-Virus and the creatures that inhabit Raccoon City (far above the Hive). We learn a lot about how the virus escaped into the population - although not a lot about how it goes SO big in Raccoon City.We meet an elite force of security officers of Umbrella Corporation, whose job it is to shut it all down... many die along the way, getting killed by zombies and dogs and brain suckers and the Red Queen's unique security systems... This film is NOT for the feint of heart when it comes to gore - both realized and intimated.....The end of the movie leaves enough unraveled threads to allow for a sequel (see RESIDENT EVIL:APOCALYPSE - released in 2004) for more.... And enough threads are resolved, giving you closure and allowing the movie to stand well enough on its own.... a 9 out of 10!",NA
"georg_gruber","14 March 2002","I just saw the movie in a sneak preview. I'm really really into the video game. I love it.The movie is great if you know the game. If you don't you'll also have a lot of fun. It's always a little risky to make a movie from a video game or comic but the film crew got it pretty right from the beginning.The story is ok, the set is great. The atmosphere in the movie is quite frightening! There are some shocking scenes in it - the audience is screaming ;-)Overall I have to say that the actors do a fair job. IMHO the movie is a little short - there could have been much more action in it. Maybe the wanted to save it for RE 2?Well, bloody funny, RE is the best horror/action combo in the last time. If you like horror flicks, get ready for a hell of a ride!7 + 1 (game bonus) = 8/10See the movie, play the great game!",NA
"ghstface","17 March 2002","Though Romero was nowhere to be found in the finally film, his archetypes were.  This visually stunning, claustrophobic piece brings the video game to life in a way rarely, if ever, seen before.  Moments of zombie-ridden calamity scream references to moments established in Romero's 'Dead' films, and leave the horror fanatic drooling with delight.  Aside from some occasional bad dialogue, a constantly brooding Michelle Rodriguez and that ever present curse of finding good zombies to act in a film, it was a stunning work of horror.  The zombie-loving public never gets a fair shake in the mainstream of Hollywood, so this is a must see if only for the moments that glimmer references to Romero-past.",NA
"brinks811","31 March 2002","I am all about Resident Evil; I have played and beaten every game in the series.  Perhaps I have carry bit of a bias.  Anyhow, I took my lady friend out to see it. I will admit that near the beginning of the film I jumped more than she did, and she called me out on it too.  I was happy with the start, middle and finish of the film, it rolled right along.  The plot also contained nice little twists, which actually made for a pretty good story. However I was a bit disappointed with the suspense of the film.  While it did have some moments that kept your heart beating loudly and strongly, I just felt like it lacked the overall suspense that the games held.  Being a big fan of Dawn of the Dead (zombie killing classic), I didn't know what to think of the zombies in Resident Evil.  I would describe them as an army undead tenacious Heroin attics, refusing to be taken down.  You can tell director Paul Anderson had some influence from Romero's masterpiece Dawn of the Dead.  There is a scene in RE that is nearly lifted right from Dawn of the Dead (the near suicide attempt if you are familiar).  Bottom line - If you are a fan of Resident Evil, you appreciate this movie, more importantly, you will LOVE the ending. 8/10",NA

"grimrogue","20 March 2002","I wasn't going to review this movie, but I just get so MAD when people go on and on about how ""Resident Evil: The Movie"" wasn't an exact representation of ""Resident Evil: The Game Series"".  What you people don't get is that we're talking about two totally different mediums of artistic expression. How can you possibly make a movie and expect to market it to the world if it only makes sense to a certain group of gamers?  And why bother making a movie in the first place since there's already an identical game people can play? Movies are not games.  They tell stories in a different way, and have much less time to do it in than a game does.  This means things have to be changed, shuffled around, and taken right out.  Characters have to be condensed, backgrounds brief, let's get right to the action.  You see what I'm saying? Resident Evil was a fun movie.  It had a comprehensible plot that didn't get bogged down technically with advanced science mumbo jumbo.  This movie basically gives you the skeleton of a much bigger story, and it's up to you to put the missing pieces together.  I never really played the games at all, and I understood everything that was going on. Go see Resident Evil if you enjoy a fast paced movie that is never corny or badly written.  Milla Jovovich was great, and I hope she gets more tough girl roles in the future.  All of the actors were well casted and there were actually a couple of surprises in the script along the way too. But if you're still reading reviews for this movie asking yourself, ""I love zombie movies, but is Resident Evil still worth my time and money?""   IT'S A MOVIE ABOUT ZOMBIES!!  That should be enough to get any fan of the genre out to see this movie.  When was the last zombie movie to hit theaters?  I mean a real zombie movie.  It's been a while right?  Go see Resident Evil.",NA

"keiseren-2","26 August 2002","CRAP! This movie is the most awful piece of garbage I have seen since ""Vanilla Sky""! Let's start with the plot. 1 homicidal computer (done in earlier movies) a lot of Zombies (done BETTER and with humour in MANY other movies) and a dash of lost memory (please, don't get me started). Hence noone really knows who the bad guy/girl is or event if there is one - and quite frankly I didn't care! The characters are so unrealistic and the acting so sub-...well---sub-everything, I'm afraid that I really couldn't care less as to who survived and who died a zombie-death we I had seen done better so many times before... hm. I think I hate Zombies now, and it is all due to this film. Damn! Oh, and I almost forgot! They decided to put in a pile of annoying and unneccesary flash-backs to p*** me off just enough to rate this movie 1 instead of a 2. So there you have it! You enjoyed this movie? SHAME ON YOU! Go home and BEG forgiveness from your DVD-player for making it play this movie!",NA
"krobyn","23 March 2002","I gave this movie a 9, but I don't rate movies in the usual fashion.  I don't think horror movies should be rated against all other types, just themselves.  It's a much more raw form of entertainment and it often fails to deliver.  I think the director, Paul Anderson, summed it up effectively in this quote, ""We tried to put into the movie that constant sense of dread and foreboding. As you play the game, as you're walking around, you're terrified as to what might happen next. That's the kind of tone of the movie.""  He is correct.  I do not hang onto people during movies, yet I had my husband's left arm in a death grip for more than half of the flick.  I may be biased in that I feel there is no other concept scarier than zombies-beings whose ONLY objective is to kill you by eating you.  Very loudly.  Ewww.  I have never played the games, since I'm a chicken when it comes to horror games, and my brother had.  I asked him what the plot was to get a feel for whether or not it was an accurate depiction.  He had very VAGUE ideas about the plot.  I was able to fill in the blanks.  I know more than he does because I believe Anderson set out to clear some things up.  I believe it only makes the movie better.  Sure there are one-liners that aren't stellar, but it IS horror.  You have to expect a little cheese with your flick.  I honestly don't think the ending could've been any better.  I was very entertained.  If you check out my other reviews though, I'm no major critic.  I go to the movies to be entertained, and I usually pay matinee price, as I did that day.  I can't say I would've loved it as much if we paid 6 more bucks to get in.  As I always say, sit back and relax. It's just entertainment.",NA
"ObiWanDan131","17 July 2002","I have always said ""why can't any film studios make a good movie from a computer game"". Every computer game movie to come out I have always thought this is going to be the first good one, but each time I have been disapointed with the like of Street Fighter (I never thought this one looked good),Super Mario Brothers, Mortal Kombat, Final Fantasy and even Tomb Raider.I was really hoping that Resident Evil would be different, not just because I enjoy a good film but because I was a huge Resident Evil fan, and this time I was not disapointed.The movie was such a great ride with the main characters in the movie, like the game, having hidden secrets, which are not that hard to guess during the movie but are interested.The casting was great for this film as well with Milla Jokovich proven how to be a good tough lead for these types of films (take note Angelina Jolie).
The start of the movie put you straight into the action before you could get a handful of popcorn with lift fulling, people drowning and other strange situations which seem to be a suspenceful as the game.
Like the game I was always worried about want was going to happen next. There was also other scenes which were even more frightening especially the action in the sewers.  The zombies were fantastic and very disturbing this was because they didn't just want to kill the people (like in most scary movies) they wanted to eat them  especially when they pulled a person into the lift and started eating him, it was not that pretty.Some bits of the movie was strange with some of the scenes starting with the group together and then suddenly Alice (Milla Jokovich) is walking down the corridor on her own and you are thinking ""why would somebody do that"", i know it happens in every horror film but its just stupid.Their was also no huge spiders (which are in the game) that I expected to jump out when they were in the sewers.I was a bit worried before watching this movie because it was made by Paul Anderson who directed Soldier and Event Horizon. But now after watching Resident Evil I am looking forward to Resident Evil 2: Nemeses.
The ending to this movie was excellent as well because it makes you want to see the sequel as soon as possible, like the Fellowship of the Rings did.Final ReviewEverything about this movie made it a fun ride, the music,the licker and Zombies, the main characters (good or bad)and the final showdown that made you want to watch more, which say a lot.8/10 I think Sarah Michelle Gellar could be great Jill Valentine for the next movie, because she has proven her self in Buffy.",NA
"wonderfulfable","29 March 2002","Just watched it today at my local cinema, and was totally blown away by everything. Terrific action, suspense, blood and guts, cool special effects, all the right combination that made the game of the same name so popular. A salute to the director.Although I was a bit disappointed that Jill Valentine and all the familiar characters from the videogame wasn't there. Maybe the reason why, I guess, was to avoid the plot predictability like 'oh she's gonna die soon' and 'oh, that one will live' and the likes. But as a fan of the game series also, I was glad that there are some references like the T-Virus, zombie dogs, walking dead, the deadly licker, underground base, labs, the transport train. There is one scene when the protagonist was escaping the facility which would ring some deja-vu to those who played the game.On to the cast, Milla Jovovich who somehow adds some femme fatale to her role - as she did likewise in the Fifth Element, Michelle Rodriguez (Fast and the Furious) reprises her tough girl role. Kudos to all those who played the commandos and zombies, and also the childlike Red Queen.All in all, i am just waiting here for the next sequel.",NA
"kimmo-tyyska","7 June 2005","Excellent remake from an all-time horror classic 'Night of the living dead'. The movie very deliberately re-creates the horrified and depressing tensions apparent in its predecessor(the aforementioned film). In spite of that it's actually more science-fiction and action-oriented than horror. Don't remember did the director of original classic participate in making of this or not, but the aspects from tension between good and dark side of human nature are all there (under the action-style mainline). Racial conflicts are not so apparent in this, in fact characters all in all are just there to decorate the story (allthough the action and plot of the movie actually begins from Milla Jovovich appearance).There's naturally a lot similarities to other(later) films than NOTLD. For example the main plot about rescue team resembles Aliens movies (especially the 2nd, but others too...) Computerized cameras and views remind me somehow from Terminator films and of course, because movie is based on a game, there's a bit of tension from game-like storytelling. Haven't played the game though, cannot say how much there's similarity.One more aspect to mention is the 'music'(or sound scape) in film which is mostly from 90's ambient and something like techno-metal effects (it might have inspired from the game actually?). It very cleverly builds excitement in crucial moments.All in all, this must be one of the best (not many are worth mentioning) scifi-horror oriented films from 90's/2000. Also, I suppose it could be one of the few really good(if not only one?) movies based on PC-game. There's a lot needles violence and blood as in this kind films usually do, but not too much to spoil the excitement of the plot...",NA
"blinkprincess17","1 February 2003","Yikes, this was a good one! ""Resident Evil"" was honestly one of the best, scariest, and fast-paced horror movies I have yet seen. *SPOILERS AHEAD* The corrupt Umbrella Corporation, a research facility, has been making obscene amounts of money working on illegal genetic and viral projects, including the horrific T-Virus, a virus which, once inserted into dead tissue, reanimates the cells of the corpse and creates the living dead. The Red Queen, the computer which controls the underground lab called ""The Hive"", has gone homicidal, sealed the exits and killed all the scientists down there to prevent the T-Virus from ever escaping. But, a special military team has been ordered to go down and find out what the hell happened down there. They take with them Matt, Alice, and Spense, three people they find in the mansion blocking the entrance to the hive, or in the train to the hive. Once underground, the horrendous truth about the T-Virus incident comes to light, and the living dead scientists destroy all but two- Alice and Matt, who try desperately to escape the Hive, succeed, and are caught and brought to a research lab. FANTASTIC closing scene! Alice awakes to find herself strapped to a bed, loaded up with needles and electrodes galore. She frees herself, only to find that the zombies have been released from the Hive and she is alone in the world. She grabs a rifle out of a police car, loads it quickly, and stands defiantly as if to say, ""Bring 'em on."" GREAT movie, loads of fabulous special effects, cool characters (Chad Kaplan, the computer genius is my personal fave!), and an awesome metal soundtrack! Give ""Resident Evil"" a try. It's the least corny zombie movie ever made- a damn GOOD one, in fact.",NA
"diegoavilarodriguez","30 December 2008","Resident evil has always been one of my favorite game series and when I heard about this film I just had to see it, so I sat down on my bed and watch it on TV and was like...Awesome! In my opinion when it comes to games like resident evil that have various story lines and many characters, it's kinda boring for a fan of the games to see the same characters and final bosses all over again, but this film has such an original resident evil storyline and original characters that I can easily see this movie fit in with story of the game without compromising the game. Mila Yovovich does a great job in this movie and I was amazed on how well she played that character, and let's not forget Michell Rodriguez which yet again shows us how much of a bad ass chick she can be. The zombies were good and kept me with chills throughout the entire film. These movie is great for both fans and people who have never played the game before and hopefully you'll enjoy the movie as much as I do.",NA
"Jexxon","20 March 2005","A virus that turns people into zombies is released inside a secret research facility. A couple of expert (I'll use the term lightly) soldiers are sent in to retrieve... something... I can't remember what it was, but I'm sure it isn't very important. Along with them are two amnesiacs and some other guy. Once inside, they have a limited time to get out again. Unfortunately, the dead have risen and zombie bashing ensues.You can't expect too much of a film based on a video game, but all the same - Resident Evil feels pretty sloppy. It has got a low budget feel to it, just witness the sparse settings, dodgy effects, and amateur make up. There isn't much in the way of character development either, so it's not easy to give a damn what happens to them. Also, it's not good when there are numerous plot holes in a film with little plot to begin with.There is a distinct lack of action as well. It takes close to half the film before any zombies show up, and even then it's just some erratic shooting accompanied by too fast editing and deafening rock music. There's not a lot of gore and blood either, which isn't good considering that it's a zombie film after all.It's not the worse film ever made - the premise is quite good, but wasted - but it resembles too many other films, and fails to show anything new or even remotely exciting. Milla Jovovich does her best with what little she's given, but she deserved better. Obviously, director and screenwriter Anderson doesn't have what it takes to put together even a half decent video-game film. There are worse films out there, but that doesn't mean that there's any reason to see this one. [1/10]",NA
"de_cafe6914","5 November 2006","Resident Evil is one of the few films based on a video game that, as a whole, didn't disappoint me. As far as I am concerned, it was a very good video game-based movie, and an entertaining zombie flick. Let me break it down.Story: Alice, a woman with no memory, is brought into a world she doesn't understand when a team of paramilitary commandos take her down into a research lab to aid them. Apparently, the entire lab was wiped out by the area's supercomputer, entitled ""Red Queen."" Their mission is to wipe out the supercomputer, and determine the cause of why everyone was killed. The trouble is, a deadly virus was released through the facility, and the people that were killed are still walking around. Resident Evil is a film about conspiracy and scientific experiments gone horribly wrong.Direction: Paul W.S. Anderson, in my opinion, is a fine director. He knows exactly what he wants to achieve in each film, and sets out to do it. Anderson knows how to build up the audience, and submerse them into a film. The pacing of the film is terrific, with just the right blend of action and horror. Anderson can work wonders with a budget, and knows how to set up the mood for the entire picture, and keep it that way. Solid! Rock on, Mr. Anderson.Acting: This was the part where the film faltered. While not horrible, the acting isn't top par, either. Milla Jovovich(Alice) played the part of the amnesiac quite well. She was definitely the finest actor in the film. The girl has talent. Michelle Rodriguez(Rain) played her usual tomboy no-nonsense character almost as good as usual, though something was missing in this performance. Eric Mabius(Matt) did a poor job. His performance was just not believable to me. James Purefoy(Spence) is a gifted actor, and I look forward to seeing him more often. As for the rest of the cast, some were good, some were poor, and some just plain sucked.Score: Marilyn Manson and Marco Beltrami composed a fantastic score for the film. Their combined efforts really helped set the tone for the entire movie, and fit in so well with what was going on. I loved it.Violence: Unlike most zombie flicks, this film is not extremely gory or revolting. The zombies shed very little blood, because, as stated in the film, it has already coagulated. Still, there are a few bloody bits. We get countless head shots, gunshot wounds, decayed zombies, some creature violence, and a particularly nasty segment with a laser.Profanity/Sexual Themes: Of course, cussing is found in this film, though I must say, it is almost always justifiable in the flick. As far as sexual themes, there are two very brief sex scenes between Milla Jovovich and James Purefoy, with a brief glimpse of nudity on Milla's end.Substance Abuse: None.Overall: By the end of the movie, I found myself thoroughly entertained. Resident Evil is a good video game adaption, and a pretty entertaining zombie flick with the perfect blend of scares and action. 7.5/10",NA
"aleayha","17 March 2002","If you go to see resident evil- go and see it because you want to have fun. Don't take it too seriously. It has some good special effects and quite a few moments that will make you jump- if not scream.
  My husband and I took my teenage son, and I was pretty skeptical about liking it. But really,- when is the last time you went to the theatre to see a zombie flick? It brought back memories!This movie is NOT for the pre teen or younger set- a young mother chose to bring her little girl- probably 4 or 5 years old - and the child was very frightened. The R rating is appropriate and parents should be aware.    The down note of the film is Michelle Rodreguiz's performance. She tried too hard to be tough- I found it annoying. The rest of the cast was pretty good.
 Go ahead and see the movie- if you liked the video game, or just want to see a good zombie flick.",NA
"boo_4ever","3 April 2005","I'm a fan of the Resident Evil vodkas. Because of that I was really looking forward to the movie. I hear Romero wanted to do something which stuck more faithfully to the plot of the games. That would have been preferable to Andersons film but thats not to say this isn't still enjoyable.The plot revolves around a virus which has the ability to reanimate dead corpses and was used to develop hideous bioweapons. When the virus escapes, the underground complex known as the Hive is sealed and a special team is sent in to investigate.Andersons film is at first nothing like the game. The original took place in a Mansion and there was no character called Alice at all who is the principal character here. However there are enjoyable references to the games such as the Licker creature which appeared in Resident Evil 2 (VG) and stalks the cast throughout the film. There is also a nice reference at the end to the Nemesis program which takes centre stage in the second film and third game.Its not a startlingly original horror film, or a film which takes the baton and refines a formula beyond what existed originally. But for fans of the games it is an interesting and enjoyable film, and that was what was intended more or less.",NA

"mightyshwanzi","17 March 2002","I love the first 'Mortal Kombat' film.  It's one of my personal favorites. It just so happens that the film I'd place next to it on my list is 'Resident Evil'... and they're both directed by Paul Anderson!  I'm a huge fan of the video games, I've played them all.  Sure this film takes some liberties (none of the characters are here at all, and there was no Red Queen), but it successfully takes the majority of what made the games so scary and suspenseful and mixes them with some outlandish action scenes. Milla Jovovich (YUM!) is a great female action hero (and flashes some nip to boot!), and tackles the lead of the film rather well.  I've never been a fan of Michelle Rodriguez (she's all pout and no talent), but in the end I was rooting for her and feeling sympathy for her character (she gets the snot pummeled out of her over the course of the film).  There's the familiar villains (Licker, zombies and the dogs), familiar scenes (both from other films and the games) and familiar faces (Eric Mabius from 'The Crow 3' and even Paul Anderson regular Jason Isaacs from 'Event Horizon' and 'Soldier') that make it all the more fun.  The industrial metal music by Marilyn Manson is great, and the FX are for the most part pretty good.  My only major gripe is that while I was expecting this movie to be another 'Tomb Raider' (i.e. complete crap) and it wasn't, I was also looking forward to seeing a good splatter flick.  There is virtually no gore to be found in this film.  Sure there's a head that gets cut off and some nasty looking zombies, but we never see anyone get eaten or ripped apart... that's a staple for a zombie movie.  One particular moment involves the Licker killing someone... it obviously takes a bite out of the person's arm, but when it pulls back there is nothing... no marks, just blood that was there before it leant in for a quick snack.  And upon seeing the victim at a higher viewpoint, we are treated to a gigantic splatter of blood around the carcass, but there are no visible wounds on the person.  Lame!  I hope there is an unrated cut available when this comes out on DVD.  And the end is great, leading directly into a sequel that I hope gets made real soon!  9 out of 10, for all the immense fun and suspense to be found in this surprisingly entertaining survival horror film.",NA
"brandon_lee420","24 December 2009","Breath in.....breath out....breath in. Hi everyone, I am here to talk about the best zombie movie ever: Resident Evil. I first viewed the film when I was six and then I didn't understand English good. When I was about nine or ten, I viewed it again and it was then that I realized that Resident Evil is a masterpiece. It has guns and blood and horror all the way through and, boy, is it one heck of a awesome ride. The lady in red, Alice(Milla Jovovich), has to be one of the most important characters of all time. I mean without her the movie would seem crap and boring but she made it look good. The story is nothing short of brilliant because it will have you captivated and immersed into a world of zombies that like to bite! When 28 days later came out along with its favorable reviews, I though that it was going to be better than Resident Evil but after watching it, 28 days later came out to be nowhere near as good as Resident evil. I love this movie and all the sequels and I can't wait for the new one called RE: Afterlife.After waking up, Alice, has no memory of her object due to the exposure of nerve gas. Along the way she joins a squad whose mission is to contain a virus released by the Red Queen, a supercomputer in charge of the release of the T-Virus. They have to fight through zombies and the Red Queens fatal traps in order to complete their mission.The acting is wonderful from Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, and many more. They know how to use their expressions and body language in the movie. The gore and horror is so stupendous it was one of the reasons this became one of my favorites. From biting people on the body to deadly traps, this movie has it all. The sequels were impressive but could not match the power of RE1. All the horror and zombie fans will have a good time enjoying a zombie movie that comes out every four or three years. Ciao, ladies and gentlemen! ****/****",NA
"ccthemovieman-1","22 December 2007","This 21st century science fiction/horror story should have been much better than it wound up. To me, it had a couple of major problems, namely: It had very few likable characters and way overdone violence. Regarding the latter, even with the good special-effects, nonstop violence only serves to become boring after awhile. When are filmmakers going to learn this? Certainly not director-writer Paul Anderson, who was responsible for this after two previous bombs in ""Event Horizon"" and ""Soldier."" If you recall, those movies also were disappointing.The women in here are Hollywood's new type of heroine: tough-looking, tough-talking and overly macho. Whatever happened to nice girls? If you lived on another planet and only watched movies made on Earth, you'd think women were physically tougher than men, and all want to act like men. Michelle Rodriguez played a character (""Rain Ocampo"") who personified this misconception to the hilt. She was annoying, to say the least, as was this film in general which is made to satisfy millions of immature young males. Judging by the amount of reviews here, the filmmakers succeeded.",NA

"dimlim77","27 March 2006","The first thing to remember here is that this movie was a very popular video game and therefore the first thing that a viewer should look for is the similarity to that game. Personally, I do not understand anyone going to see this without at least some knowledge of the game. Having said all that, this movie was almost perfect in relating to the game.This movie had the same locations as the game, the exact same story and all the right characters that made the game so interesting. The action was good from the beginning to end and the only reason I did not vote the movie a 10 on 10 (based on rating previous VG movies) was that it suffered from the stereotypically not so perfect acting. Let's face it, it usually sucks in these types of movies. I know that this review might seem empty but the truth is that there is not much to say. The music fits perfectly, the casting was right for the movie (even if their acting was not perfect) and it stayed true to the original. My only advice is to stay away if you don't know about Resident Evil because that may cause you to have a lesser opinion of a movie that does exactly what it is supposed to.",NA
"Uriah43","8 November 2012","The Umbrella Corporation is a multi-conglomerate which operates a secret underground laboratory beneath a metropolitan area called Raccoon City. Inside the lab, scientists were illegally producing a virus which reanimates dead human beings. Realizing that the T-virus was worth a great sum of money on the black market, a thief steals the virus. However, just before attempting to escape the facility with the virus and the antidote, he deliberately contaminates the lab. Unfortunately, he doesn't quite make it out before being knocked out by nerve gas. A crack team of commandos then enter the facility and capture three people: ""Alice"" (Milla Jovovich), ""Matt Addison"" (Eric Mabius) and ""Spence Parks"" (James Purefoy). Everyone else has been supposedly killed by the computer defense system known as ""the Red Queen"". Racing against time, the commandos enter the facility known as ""the hive"" to disable the Red Queen and find out what has happened. Anyway, rather than divulge anything that might spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, I will stop right here. However, I would like to say that while the overall acting isn't that great, Milla Jovovich, and to a lesser extent Michelle Rodriguez (as the commando named ""Rain Ocampo""), give awesome performances. Additionally, the action is fast-paced and the music complements it very well. All in all, I found this movie to be very exciting and it should appeal to those who like an action-packed thriller of this sort.",NA
