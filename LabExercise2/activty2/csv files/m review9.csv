"Gordon-11","17 February 2016","This film tells the story of a cowardly young dinosaur, who lost his way home after a storm. He befriends a young human being in prehistoric times. They navigate the treacherous lands in search of their respective homes.The visuals in the film are quite stunning. The colours are vivid and bright, while the backdrop is always beautiful and at times even breathtaking. It's interesting to see a talking dinosaur, while the young human being behaves more like a dog, which is further reinforced by the name spot. I enjoyed the exciting and on occasion dangerous adventure they share together. It's an inspiring story to help children and adults find courage to conquer difficult times.","

"MrGenre","18 June 2016","I felt compelled to write a review, primarily because there are so many ""1 star"" reviews taking up residence on this site. Let's be frank, folks. If it wasn't Pixar, you wouldn't be whining about how ""awful"" it was.Here's the truth for those who are actually interested in seeing it: it's a pretty great flick.I would love to hop on here and tell you that everyone's wrong and it's the most amazing animated movie I've ever seen, but that wouldn't be true. I would honestly say it's near the bottom when compared to all the other Pixar films.But it's still a lot of fun. Here are the most laudable aspects, in my humble opinion:1: The animation is the best Pixar has done to this point. It's truly beautiful! They did a tremendous job of capturing the beauty of nature, from forests to prairies, and interposing an almost cheesy-looking dinosaur in the midst of it was fantastic. Don't waste your time with a DVD on this one, splurge for the Blu-Ray.2: The characters are heartwarming, and the plot is simple. Frances McDormand is especially wonderful as the mother of the simple farming family of apatosaurs, and the characters are driven by simple values like family and hard-work. I understand why many were frustrated with the simplicity of the plot, but do we always have to jump the shark in a movie? It's a fun and beautiful journey.3: It's a beautiful parody of a classic western story/film. I'm a little annoyed that the previews didn't push this aspect more, because a lot of the movie-bashing is based on the fact that people didn't get the story they expected. This is not unlike classic Disney movies like ""The Incredible Journey."" Don't expect something modern or game-changing here. This is just a twist on a classic homecoming story.I hope this preview helps dispel some of the hate. It's a fun movie, and worth a watch, even if it's not my favorite Pixar.","

"AlsExGal","22 December 2016","... which is the impression I got when I saw the DVD cover art, the title, and the trailers.It came on one of the pay channels the other day and I sat down to watch. What I found was a whacked out ""what if"" view of natural history plus a tale on facing your fears and finding friendship where you least expect it.The movie starts with a bang - literally. Dinosaurs are eating in a field 65 million years ago as an asteroid comes tumbling towards earth. The dinosaurs look up. The asteroid passes harmlessly overhead. The dinosaurs continue eating. So the mass extinction never happens.Millions of years pass and the dinosaurs evolve. The ""vegi-sauruses"" become farmers. The ""meat-asauruses"" become ranchers. One humorous turn introduces us to a timid Styracosaurus who has evolved into a terrified animal that puts small animals all over his horns to protect himself from all kinds of threats that grow out of his neurotic fears.At the core of it is a family of Apatosaurus farmers with three children. The smallest is Arlo, who is afraid of his own shadow. His nemesis is ""Spot"" a human child that keeps getting into the family silo and eating the crops. But these two have to team up when a natural disaster sweeps Arlo far from home and he is forced to face his fears.I thought the idea of evolving dinosaurs living alongside the dawn of man at the point where man is just at ""dog level""-a mute primitive creature - was intriguing enough to keep the adults engaged while Arlo's story is enough to keep the children around along with the unique sight gags I've come to expect from Pixar. Highly recommended as an unexpected treat, at least from my perspective.","

"kosmasp","18 November 2016","So this movie is probably a lot better than what you might have heard. But some parents may have some issues with the themes and things portrayed in here in general. It may be a bit too much for their children to watch. There are some adult situations here (as in life happens and the ""brutality of it"", without getting explicit), some dramatic moments that may stay in ones mind.Having said that, you could say, that this is challenging and if you really think about it, animated movies in the past that are considered classics, had some horrible moments in them (without spoiling the moments, just two examples: Bambi and Lion King). Even the Last Unicorn had some dark themes in it. So maybe we try to overprotect children, where they don't need to be protected? It's a fair question though, but the movie handles it very discreetly and to the point.","

"TheLittleSongbird","24 February 2016","After being blown away by Pixar's previous film 'Inside Out' (which is one of their best too), while not really deserving of so many 1- star reviews 'The Good Dinosaur' disappointed on many levels. Not just lesser Pixar but a contender for their worst too, even more so than the often panned 'Cars 2' (which to me while not great was not that bad). It is a long way from an awful film, certainly much better than several reviews have lead you to believe (seeing as 1- star indicates no redeeming qualities, which is not the case here), but considering Pixar's usual incredibly high standard I was expecting so much more. There are a number of good things here in 'The Good Dinosaur'. Much of the animation is spectacular, including some of Pixar's most gorgeously vivid colours and some of their most stunning and rich- in-detail backgrounds. The music score is both whimsical and energetic, and the film also benefits from some clever casting and very strong voice acting, Sam Elliot in particular stands out. Many have complained of Arlo's voice work, it wasn't a problem personally.On top of those, 'The Good Dinosaur' does have some genuinely funny moments (mostly visual), parts that are genuinely touching, some thumping, thrilling action, a beautifully realised central friendship, an endearing lead character in Arlo and an inspirational main message (as a matter of fact, all the lessons and messages the film teaches are great). So a lot to admire. However, 'The Good Dinosaur' does fall short. While there is much to admire in the animation overall, it also contains the least appealing character designs in any of Pixar's film, the photo- realistic look looks cartoony rather than realistic and jars against the vivid backgrounds . While keeping things simple can work in a film's favour, 'The Good Dinosaur' is rather too simple and straight-forward that the storytelling while not completely dull lacks momentum and veers on being too paper-thin and simplistic as well as being too predictable and familiar. Target audience is also an issue. Adults may find themselves checking their watches, not that it's completely dull but unlike much of Pixar's other films it is not consistently captivating. And with children, while this viewer usually tries to not complain about anything being too dark or unnecessary and has been known to defend films criticised for that 'The Good Dinosaur' is an example of a film where that criticism is valid and understandable, because there is some dark and disturbing content (like a decapitation and a drug reference) that added absolutely nothing and quite frankly had no place in a family film. The violence is similarly gratuitous. The script is inconsistent in the laughs and emotional investment factors and is not as clever, witty, insightful or as intelligently structured as the writing for Pixar's best, coming across as even more paper-thin and simplistic than the storytelling and the dialogue itself is often cheesy and clichéd. In conclusion, not as bad as most have made out but very much a lesser Pixar. Has enough good merits to make it watchable, but it's the only Pixar film to date to disappoint me. Very hard to decide between a 5 or 6, as it was actually not easy to rate, so it's got a 5.5/10 (somewhere in between). Bethany Cox","

"thebasedupdate","12 June 2016","The fact that this movie still holds a score of a 6.8 with hundreds of 1/10 scores shows you just how good it is. I'm not here to preach that it's an awesome movie, but give it the score it deserves. (It's not PIXAR's best, but still fits the bill of a good movie.)Honestly the highly negative scores are just because people were not BLOWN away. A PIXAR movie sets the bar so high, so the fact that this one isn't an A+, people are bashing just to bash.I watched this with my cousins, all at the time were under 10 ( 7 & 9 ) and nothing was too scary. Could it be over the top for 4 or 5 year old, of course, but it's not that bad. The Lion King is regarded as one of the BEST Disney films ever and there are similar scenes with death, scary bad-guys, hard times, etc. Give it a watch.","

"tedg","21 February 2016","I follow certain filmmakers in a way unlike any other relationship. If they have worked well for me at least once, they become a permanent part of my life, not friends or family because I give nothing back. When they try and fail, it becomes something of a failure of mine to learn from.Pixar is in this class of 'filmmakers' because there I see a certain consistent set of ambitions and values. Creative, polished story is what most people see, but what interests me is the deep exploration of what it means to tell stories visually, cinematically.These men and women aggressively expand the cinematic vocabulary. Sometimes it is local, in some minute orchestration of character movement; I am not skilled enough to see and understand where these are new. But I can see and understand how they push the way we can communicate about *space* and the movement of the eye in it.In this, they have two concerns. I've remarked elsewhere on the most visible one: how they understand the third dimension and where we place the camera. They can expand this because the camera is no longer physical. They've gone so far as to design whole story worlds to allow for stretching this. The other experimental area is more subtle and perhaps more influential in the long run. It used to be that the environment in films was that we lived in, and incidentally captured by the camera. Except in very rare cases, like some of the work of Welles and Kurosawa, it is static, dead, not able to participate in the communication. In cartoons, the background was ever more so.But CGI breaks that boundary as well. I saw the problems they had with trying to innovate with conscious snow interacting with conscious hair in Brave. They had all sorts of other difficulties with this film, many of them not relevant to the experiment in conscious background but it has to be considered a success.The story isn't particularly novel in having the environment be the protagonist, but it is novel in the emotional texture they were able to impart to that environment. The characters' texture and form have been reduced and that of the environment increased. There was never in reality water this full of life, vegetation with this much unified presence. They moved the old story-focused director out and moved in a texture animator and incidentally gave him a story to tell.It is not typical of Pixar that the filmmaker is allowed to make a statement, but here we have him creating a character that enters the story and announces his intentions. He is part of the environment, appearing first as a tree and stepping out to be a multi horned creature that 'collects' pets that each play a role. This is one of the most sophisticated in jokes I recall, directly related to the focus on the background as foreground.","

"dickson-88463","4 March 2016","It's pretty amazing that so many people seem to want to trash this movie. I watched this with my 2 daughters and my 10 year old said it was the best movie she's ever seen. She identified with Arlo's anxiety and insecurity as she also feels this way sometimes. His journey in dealing with these issues by facing his fears and, even if sheepishly at first, challenging them one by one helped her to understand herself. It allowed her to see that others struggle and can overcome these struggles in a way she hadn't seen before... up close and personal. As a child and adolescent therapist in practice for over 16 years, I can definitively tell you that any movie that prompts a child to look into themselves... to challenge their fears... and ends with them hugging you tightly, is a true marvel to behold. It's the core of the emotional artistry that movies are meant to be. Having an emotional connection to a movie or any work of art for that matter, will always win out over special effects and beautiful backdrops. It's the reason Star Wars: A New Hope was brilliant and The Phantom Menace sucked. Anyone have any kind of emotional connection to The Phantom Menace these days?","

"ratslovetherachel2","8 March 2016","Another win for Disney Pixar. My 3&5 year old boys loved Arlo and spot. We prefaced this movie with The Land Before Time. My children were fully aware that when the first man evolved that it was a dangerous and scary place. It still is,just the predators are people mostly. I guess they aren't as sheltered as some of the other reviewers children. We laughed when they ate the hallucinogenic berries, and cried together when spot was reunited with his family.The art was absolutely spectacular and awe inspiring. All in all it is better than Planes and a little bit less than Wreck it Ralph.We have purchased it on Blu Ray to watch again and again","

"eireanngobrach23","31 March 2016","***WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS*** Don't believe all the bad reviews. People have sticks up their asses.The only mistake Pixar made was releasing this 5 months or so after Inside Out. This movie pales in comparison. That being said, it's a good movie. My 4 year old loves it. It's not necessarily of the same caliber as the other Pixar movies (except Cars 2; you are all forgetting that one. It is by far the worst one.)It's definitely dark and has some pretty adult elements, but it's not something a kid can't handle. It's not traumatic, by any means. Give your kids some credit. The whole theme of the movie is conquering fear, so it might do your kid some good to watch it. And stop saying it's a bad carbon copy of The Lion King just because the dad dies. How many times has that happened in other Disney movies? Stop it.I'll just say watch it and see for yourself. No, it's not as good as Inside Out, but it's a solid movie, and it stands on its own. It's worth watching.","

"paul_haakonsen","29 September 2016","I sat down to watch ""The Good Dinosaur"" with my family, that being wife and 6 year old son, and I didn't really have any idea that I would end up being as entertained by this animated movie as I was. I had thought that this would just be another one of those mass-produced generic animated movies aiming for the kids.The story in ""The Good Dinosaur"" was actually surprisingly good, and it was told in a very entertaining way, and also in a way that kept the movie progressing at a constant good pace. There weren't really any dull moments throughout the course of the movie, and even the slower moments in the movie were good and had crucial parts to the overall storyline.The CGI, style and textures in ""The Good Dinosaur"" were all very impressive. But of course, Pixar is well-known for that, and they didn't disappoint by any means with this 2015 release. The entire animated world was rich in color, details and very lovable.As for the characters portrayed in ""The Good Dinosaur"", well there is something for everyone here. I dare say that much. Of course you have someone brave, someone lovable, someone daring, someone clumsy, etc. etc. It was all here. And they had managed to get together and impressive group of voice actors and actresses for the various roles. And for an animated movie, then the voice acting is essential.""The Good Dinosaur"" is the kind of story that you take to heart immediately and you will be entertained right up to the very end of the movie, that is for sure. And although you already know how the movie will end, it is still a good story to experience and an entertaining movie to watch.This 2015 animated movie, like most Pixar movies, is of the type that you can watch more than just a single time. And it does stand out from many other Pixar movies, mainly because of the setting of the age of dinosaurs and the characters.""The Good Dinosaur"" scores a solid six stars out of ten rating from me, as it is a movie that has that ability to make you feel good, feel entertained and make you laugh all at the same time.","

"kirstienne","1 April 2016","I'm in my twenties and to be honest, I still enjoy watching Pixar films with my family. There's just something so genuine and beautiful about their movies, not to mention the endless amount of lessons one can learn.When I initially read the reviews about ""The Good Dinosaur"", they were all so bad. It didn't stop me from watching though and I do not regret that decision. This has got to be one of the most heartwarming Pixar films I've ever seen and it tugged at my heartstrings. I was crying throughout the movie especially towards the end. The thing about being an adult, we tend to overthink something so simple. The plot isn't something grand. It's not funny. It's cute. If you're looking for a film like the classic Pixar favorite ""Toy Story"", forget about watching this. It's a really simple storyline that focuses mainly on teaching the importance of family, dealing with fears and overcoming them as well as finding oneself or making your mark in this world. View ""The Good Dinosaur"" with an open mind and just be ready to enjoy the movie without reading too much between the lines. The good thing about Pixar films is that they remind you how wonderful it is to still be a kid at heart. This movie is no exception. In fact, I think this joins the ranks of ""Finding Nemo"",""UP"", and ""Inside Out"". Everyone has a right to their own opinion, but I can't help but wonder why majority just plain dislike this movie. If you're on the fence after reading one too many 1-star reviews, I say go ahead and still watch it. Judge for yourself. Be pure hearted like a kid and try to embrace the beautiful lessons of the film. Allow it to engulf you and touch you. If you have a kid/kids, this would be one of those perfect films to have a hearty conversation with afterwards. It's very inspiring, really. Give ""The Good Dinosaur"" a try. Oh and one more thing, don't be afraid to cry while watching this. I've seen this twice and still end up a mess every time.","

"glenn93-8-324920","20 February 2016","reading the other reviews about this film i can barely believe my eyes! all of you are complaining about it being to violent and having bad influences on kids but it is one of only 4 Pixar movies with a PG rating which should tell you it might be a little darker than other Pixar films. but here is m review, The film revolves around a little scared dinosaur named Arlo and i think Arlo represents many of the kids in our modern society, in the film they bring problems like Loneliness, not feeling like you belong, the importance of family, death,conquering you're fears into the light.The scene near the end where Arlo lets Spot go and join his new family was really really touching. for those complaining that the plot is too simple, remember that it is in facts a kids movie its supposed to be, its not a film that you sit down and think about hours on end after viewing it, it'something you enjoy there and then.all in all I really enjoyed the movie, it had me laughing at times and had me crying at times.","

"cherold","14 August 2016","If you can make it through the tedious first third, it's not a bad little movie. The interplay between Arlo and Spot is generally enjoyable (the first really good scene is Spot trying to feed Arlo). The movie can be quite funny, somewhat thrilling, and occasionally touching.So basically, if this was some kids cartoon from some lesser studio, this would be pretty good. For Pixar though, it's a big disappointment.One of the film's biggest flaws is also one of its greatest strengths; the animation. On the one hand, the landscapes - forests, rivers, fields - have an amazing photo-realism that mark them as an incredible achievement in animation. But this hyper-realism makes the main dinosaur breed look terrible; they are about as realistic as the cars in Cars, and it's like someone filmed a sock puppet show in the Grand Canyon. It's the thing most reviewers seem to talk about, so it's rather amazing that Pixar didn't see the problem themselves.It's not that the dinosaurs needed to look real, but the insistence on those giant, soulful eyes made the heads misshapen, and the colors are too clean and shiny to meld with the environments. Other breeds of dinosaurs and insects have an acceptable cartooniness, but Arlo is just annoying in design, creating a constant de-immersion signal.The story is conventional and predictable, the emotional moments feel manipulative, but still, it's not bad as kid's cartoons go. But it sure isn't what we expect from Pixar.","

"RforFilm","2 December 2015","With a movie like The Good Dinosaur coming from Disney, the first thing that comes to mind is how late in the game they are in the prehistoric creature game. When I think of Disney and dinosaurs, I think in the sequence from Fantasia that tells the story of the creation of the Earth with a part on dinosaurs that is in total silence with the exception of the Rite of Spring symphony from Igor Stravinsky. Or even with animated movies in general, when I think dinosaurs, my mind goes to The Land Before Time movies (the first one being the only good one) that was already Disney-like in tone. But with The Good Dinosaur coming from the Pixar team, that left me open to the idea and for my expectations to be raised even higher. Especially with the incredibly good Inside Out coming out earlier in the summer, this movie must be really good if the Disney company set this for Thanksgiving weekend, a week that normally is the ground for some of the best. If Pixar can take us under the sea with Finding Nemo and into a world of living cars in Cars, how does Pixar do with imagination in The Good Dinosaur?The film starts out (as the previews have shown many times) that this is an alternative world where the asteroid that killed all the dinosaurs has never hit the Earth. Instead, the dinosaurs get to evolve into more intelligible creatures that can farm, hunt and start families like humans can. Millions of years later, two Apatosaurus' farmers Henry (played by Jeffrey Wright) and Ida (played by Francis McDormand) are witnessing the hatching of their eggs. The first two, Libby and Buck are regular sized and seem ready to go to help out on the farm, but little Arlo is the runt of the litter.Arlo is timid and prone to fear, especially from the chickens that he feeds. His dad tries to make him feel more important by tasking him to trap the one that's been stealing the food they've been planting. When the trap captures a young cave boy, Arlo frees it, feeling he can't kill it. Sometime later, the cave boy returns, though Arlo goes after it. When the young dinosaur accidentally falls into the river and gets knocked unconscious, he wakes up in a part of the land he doesn't recognize. He sees that the cave boy keeps following him like a dog, so Arlo names him ""Spot"" and the two set off on an adventure to get back home. The Good Dinosaur had the unfortunate luck of having to come out after the other Pixar movie, Inside Out, which still remains one of my favorites of 2015. When comparing the two, The Good Dinosaur is surprisingly underwhelming. The story feels very reminiscent of Finding Nemo, except that neither Arlo nor Spot are that interesting of characters. They're pretty much the typical coward and feral child, yet the only dynamic of this ""a boy and his pet"" story is that position is switched.The more I thought about the idea of a world where dinosaurs and people live together, the more I thought that there was a lot of possibilities with the idea, but with the people just as non speaking cave people that act like animals, you could easily replace them with monkeys and the story would not change a lot. At least the Flintstones took their environment to their advantage.As a Pixar movie, the story is still emotional and the animation is some of the most photo realistic I've seen, but this is likely to cater to only kids, leaving adults wondering what happened to the family friendly writing that made Toy Story and Finding Nemo so likable.I'll give this four Apatosaurus' out of ten. The Good Dinosaur is not a bad movie, just a very weak story when compared to what Pixar has given us and is likely to stay as a serviceable story for the younger ones.","

"DareDevilKid","19 December 2015","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 1.7/5 starsPixar's latest feature wonders what life would have been like if the asteroid that had killed the dinosaurs hadn't hit Earth. According to writers Peter Sohn (who also directed), Erik Benson, Meg LeFauve, Kelsey Mann, and Bob Peterson, it would have been like a western movie, with dinosaurs as farmers, cowboys, and outlaws. That's not a story, it's an idea, and a half-baked one at that. Sohn and company, whose prior credits consist mainly of grunt work for Pixar (animator, storyboard artist, additional voices etc.), were pathetically unready for prime time, and the result of their blown opportunity is an unrelieved disaster.First and foremost, ""The Good Dinosaur"" is an excruciating bore, with no story whatsoever, and inhabited by dull characters.Secondly, what happened to the basic premise highlighted in the trailers and the film's opening act of what could have been had that asteroid not hit 66 million years ago...the writers dangled a candy before audiences of mind-boggling potential, and then totally abandoned it to offer up a mundane tale with plot elements that have been done to death several times over. It was a story that didn't need the what-if-dinosaurs-had-survived setup, a story that could have just as easily have worked if any other main character had been featured as its protagonist. That's my biggest point of contention (besides many other higgles) with this film - in the quest of showcasing human traits and making the story identifiable, the main character ultimately has no defining appeal, something most Pixar characters possess despite their stories rooted in human realism.And finally, regardless how dinosaurs might have evolved, T-Rexs couldn't have suddenly turned all affable, and no way would human have become rabid, sniffing dogs - alright now I'm nitpicking, but that's the level of frustration this film evokes.","

"davidwright-01150","27 February 2016","I hadn't seen this movie before buying it. But, we have liked all the other movies by Pixar, so it seemed like a sure thing. I read the reviews on IMDb and found only one good review in around fifty. I figured we had bought a ""lemon"". After watching the film my thoughts were basically as follows: Have none of you ever seen The Land Before Time? This sure seems like this generations LBT. So many people talked about how it scared their kid. Good! Now go home and TALK ABOUT IT! Kids should know that life isn't going to be peaches and cream all the time, and that sometimes we have to deal with sad hard things. Also, what is wrong with every kids movie not being filled with hilarious moments. Why is it so bad that this movie focuses on the hard knocks of life, but shows that life can be bearable and happy? I want my kids to learn the lessons taught here. I read reviews citing movies like Lion King and Finding Nemo saying how much better they were. Well if you watch this movie, it's basically the same thing, just different characters and less laugh out loud funny moments. I am not trying to be mean, but grow some balls people. I saw kids movies that scared me when I was a kid and you know what happened? NOTHING! I wasn't scarred for life. I didn't have to see a counselor. I just learned that things are sometimes scary, and I didn't watch those movies any more. Seriously people. Why does everything in life have to be so dang negative. Look for the good. This movie is filled with good messages for adults and for kids. Watch it, and if it bothers you, don't let your kids see it and don't buy it. It's that simple.","

"moviexclusive","24 November 2015","Pixar, most of all, should know that what goes 'Up' must eventually come down; and so it is with their second effort of the year, which not only is a step down from their brilliant 'Inside Out' but is also ultimately one of the least in their oeuvre. Grafting a familiar man-and-his-beast story around a young Apatosaurus named Arlo (voiced by Raymond Ochoa) and a feral human child whom he names Spot (voiced by Jack Bright), 'The Good Dinosaur' strands the former miles away from home in service of a coming-of-age tale that sees him learn to overcome his fears while developing an immutable bond with the latter. It's a road trip all right, but one that though inspired in parts feels on the whole pedestrian to the point of monotony.One certainly expects much more from the premise, which imagines an alternate path of evolution based on the supposition that the asteroid which killed the dinosaurs millions of years ago actually missed Earth. As such, the prehistoric creatures have remained Earth's dominant lifeforms, learning to farm, rear chickens and build homes. On the other hand, humans are much further down the evolutionary ladder, no more or better than cavemen that go about on all fours sniffing things and peeing on trees. That explains the role reversal between Arlo and Spot, such that while Arlo speaks perfectly good English, Spot pretty much does so in grunts and growls while gnashing his teeth at anything it perceives to be hostile.At first, the relationship between Arlo and Spot seems to cast in a much more complex mould; after all, they first make each other's acquaintance when Arlo disobeys his father's order to kill the critter who has been stealing their corn supply and instead sets it free, a move which in a chain reaction of events results in Arlo's dad being tragically killed. It is somewhat disappointing to learn soon after that their unlikely bond is made up in fact of entirely familiar stuff, so in too short a matter of time, the former adversaries become best friends after Spot helps Arlo find food and navigate the initial 'culture shock' of the wilderness. With only each other to depend on, Spot also becomes Arlo's unlikely companion as he makes his journey back to his family, made up of Momma (Frances McDormand) and two older siblings Buck (Marcus Scribner) and Libby (Maleah Padilla).The journey back home for Arlo will be a test of his bravery and willpower, both of which Spot demonstrate in good measure, no doubt honed out of sheer necessity from having to forge his own way in the world. Their tender, largely wordless friendship is the emotional anchor which holds the entire movie together, and to first-time director Peter Sohn's credit, accumulates poignancy over the course of the film, paying off in an exciting climax in which Arlo's courage will be key to their mutual survival as well as an understated sendoff right after that will bring tears to the eyes of some. As is typical of such tales, it is the ""beast"" – or in this case, Spot – who steals the show, and the hunter-toddler swaddled in a diaper of leaves with his dog- like antics is adorable and hilarious to say the least.Yet even though the cross-species bonding does have its emotional resonance, there is more than a nagging doubt that it could have been a lot, a lot more affecting. Across beautifully rendered CG backdrops that look breathtakingly realistic, our unlikely pair of heroes engage in sporadically amusing encounters with various colourful characters, including a kooky cross-eyed styracosaurus (voiced by Sohn) which tries to claim Spot as his own, a group of unhinged pterodactyls led by the ""enlightened"" Thunderclap (Steve Zahn), and a trio of cattle ranching T-rexes whose leader is the gruff and grizzled cowboy Bunch with the signature baritone (that's Sam Elliott for you) as well as a pack of nasty raptors who have been preying on Bunch's herd.Between themselves, Arlo and Spot also squeeze in a hallucinogenic episode courtesy of some queer fruit as well as a game of blowing gopher-like creatures out of their holes in the ground. Notwithstanding the fact that these vignettes are entertaining in and of themselves, their broad, often madcap mode of humour feels jarring next to the quieter, more sublime moments between Arlo and Spot alone. More significantly, their very fleeting nature leaves one with the impression that they serve ultimately no purpose than as diversion from a thin story that is coupled with a formulaic, well-worn character narrative, with the same unfortunately true for the thrill ride-like setpieces that send Arlo and Spot tumbling down rapids.Given how Pixar's works are often held up as the gold standard of feature animation, it is more than a little disappointing that their latest is that mediocre. The technical accomplishments here in terms of recreating the natural rugged beauty of Yellowstone's waterfalls to Montana's grasslands are undeniable, but Pixar's mantra has always been about putting the story and its characters first, and 'The Good Dinosaur' leaves us feeling short-changed on both fronts. Indeed, we would have been suitably impressed if this were the debut effort of a fledging studio, but as one bearing the Pixar brand name, this is no 'Ratatouille', no 'The Incredibles', no 'Inside Out' and not even 'Cars'. It is barely serviceable despite evident steps at salvaging a troubled production, which by Pixar's standards, is simply a letdown.","

"Vic_max","25 November 2015","If you watched the trailer and wondered if there's any strong plot going on -- you'll be disappointed ... unless you're a kid. But even if you're a kid, this is no ""Frozen"". Most of the audience in my viewing were kids. It mostly held their attention but there was minimal responsiveness ... it's not humorous, high-action, fast-paced or sprinkled with lots of color; It's kind of a somber-toned, B-movie.It basically follows two child characters trying to get home in a wilderness -- and that about sums it up. One doesn't speak and the main one is kind of dull.Compare it to strong movies like ""Finding Nemo"", ""Toy Story"", ""Cars"", ""Ratatouille"" - heck, even ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Alladin"" and you'll immediately realize that this is seriously lackluster and mediocre by comparison.And the 3D visuals? Good - not great. I'll bet if it were on TV, you'd channel flip after watching a few minutes ... no such luxury in the theater.","

"anaconda-40658","14 January 2016","The Good Dinosaur (2015): Dir: Peter Sohn / Voices: Raymond Ochoa, Jeffrey Wright, Frances McDormand, Anna Paquin, Sam Elliott: Easily outdoes Brave in being the worst Pixar film. This utter juvenile bore is about facing one's fears, which totally bypasses the title, which makes it sound like this young dinosaur is some sort of do- gooder. It opens with long neck dinosaurs ploughing fields and planting corn. This completely throws viewers into the realms of bad writing. This dino couple has three kids and the youngest, Arlo struggles to measure up. Structure attempts to be creative with Arlo off on his own and being friended by a cave kid. We know where this is headed with Arlo making the revelation to his family that he can face his fears. While the animation is festive enough the screenplay is an absolute bore. After Pixar released an innovative creative masterpiece like Inside Out, this is a massive disappointment. The worst element in that horrid voice acting for Arlo. These films usually contain funny and interesting characters with quirky bits that enhance their personalities. Not so here. Arlo is given a whining wailing right of passage that gets old quick. This dinosaur has about as much personality as the massive sh*t he leaves behind. The cave kid acts more like a pet than a possible human being. Children love dinosaurs, so why not present a film that captures their imagination and brings them into the prehistoric world they inhabit? Instead we get a film that I spent several minutes dosing off through before getting up and leaving before the hour mark. There is not much good here, but there is a lot of bad. Score: 4 / 10","

"robin_sayer","30 November 2015","Pixar have always been a shining light of absolute quality in story telling, characters and animation.Where DreamWorks and Disney often labor the point of a story, or fumble around in sentimentality, mediocrity - Pixar have always been absolutely genius at bringing something original and truly memorable to the screen. A company that produces such wonderful movies as Cars, The Incredibles, Nemo, Toy Story and Wall-E - should not, could not - produce this completely worthless piece of nonsense.My three year old spends his days singing the songs from Cars, recreating the action with his toys, and playing with his Woody and Buzz - he's also a HUGE dinosaur fan - so while something like ""Inside Out"" is a bit beyond him, how could a dinosaur movie where the dinosaur is good rather than 'scarewee' as he says go wrong!!!!Seemingly on every single level.While the scenery is gorgeously rendered with absolute realism the characters themselves are completely devoid of any effort at all. There is nothing about Arlo the dinosaur or the small human boy that is even slightly interesting or novel. They are drawn and animated as though someone said to an animator - you have 10 minutes to render a dinosaur and a small boy. It is saying something when the toy dinosaur in Toy Story is rendered with more love and affection, and more genuine character than any dinosaur in an entire movie which has the word 'Dinosaur' in the title.Apart from a small 2 minute section of the movie, where they meet a very interesting hippie dinosaur who was brilliant but who they inexplicably just bump into, exchange about 20 words with and then leave - there is no redeeming or interesting character anywhere in the movie.Arlos father seems to be more interested in Arlo murdering a child, his siblings seem to be evil bullies - Arlo himself is a wimp and the human child is more wolf like than human. Every other character they meet seems to be either racist (some deep South accented dinosaurs portrayed as dumb hicks) or some weird T-Rexes who gallop along rounding up bison with accents straight out of John Wayne movies.The film moves from one scary scene to the next, so from horrible storm and a badly injured limping Arlo, to Arlos father being drowned in the river, to Arlo in another storm falling down a hill and passing out in the water, to him falling off a cliff, to him running out of food, to being attacked and hunted and so on and so on.It is completely relentless in its desire to just move to another cliff hanger. The friendship between Arlo and the human boy seems like fluff - with just silly setups like character A gets stuck, wakes to find character B has helped them. Character A gets hungry, finds character B leaving or shoving food there way. Character A and B fall asleep and wake up to find they're leaning against each other. There are no genuine touching moments, ""Ice Age"" while garbage compared to most of Pixars output, still managed a more convincing buddy story of odd companions traveling together than did this movie.At the end of the movie Arlo finds his way home and inexplicably pushes the human boy onto a random human family that he moments before rejected for some reason. He makes his way home and is allowed to leave his foot print on a wall which he wasn't allowed to do earlier because his family viewed him as a giant clumsy wimp who wouldn't kill a human.There was so much opportunity for a movie which had the premise that ""What if, the dinosaurs weren't wiped out"". But apart from the farm that Arlo and his family come from, there is no indication of any dinosaur civilization other than random ones that try to either attack him or eat him. I was expecting something more Flintstones - but it seams that the only premise for the meteor missing the earth was to allow a dinosaur and a human to co-exist in the story.","

"StevePulaski","27 November 2015","""The Good Dinosaur,"" at least at the AMC where I saw it, opens with director Peter Sohn thanking us for supporting creativity and actually going to the theater to see his film, rather than sitting hunched over a computer seeding a torrent of it. He proceeds to tell us how, as a young boy in America with a mother who struggled with English, he would explain the story to her so that she'd understand. However, being that many moments in animated films are emphasized by music, facial expressions, and true human emotions, he says, some moments didn't need any explanation at all. Sohn concludes by saying that ""The Good Dinosaur"" is a testament to animation's universal language.I may have been the only one in my respective screening with a pit in my stomach after hearing that, because right then and there, I feared ""The Good Dinosaur"" - a relatively low-key Pixar release and arguably destined to be about as forgettable in the minds of consumers as ""A Bug's Life"" - would be an animated film that emphasized emotional claptraps and mawkish sentiments. Sure enough, my worst fears were realized. While its imagery is evocative and its landscapes immaculately detailed to a rare level of photorealism, ""The Good Dinosaur"" is a shamefully manipulative and disappointingly routine story by an acclaimed studio that should be spending its time a bit more wisely.Unlike many people, I don't feel that Pixar has fallen off so much as they've begun taking the easy way out, churning out sequels to films in order to assure a high opening weekend and even higher merchandising revenue, rather than consistently releasing subversive animated works like this year's ""Inside Out"" (with the future holding ""Finding Dory,"" ""The Incredibles 2,"" and ""Toy Story 4,"" I hearby rest my case). This is a film that would've been perfectly acceptable as a direct-to-DVD Disney sequel to the long-running ""Land Before Time"" series; it's not something that we should try and justify as a great, or even a really good, work from an animated studio that has redefined what an animated film can and who it can appeal to.The film revolves around a family of Apparatuses, who serve as farmers of a large, fruitful area of land. They are Henry (voiced by Jeffrey Wright) and Ida (Frances McDormand), who give birth to three children in the opening scene: Libby (Maleah Padilla), Buck (Marcus Scribner), and Arlo (Raymond Ochoa). Arlo is different from both Libby and Buck in that he's significantly smaller, not as mischievous, and struggles with arduous tasks that Libby and Buck can perform with ease. During a time when food scarcity is a very real problem, Henry encourages his children to ""leave their mark"" on the silo where they store food; such is a privilege is obtained when they do something selfless that benefits the family. Before Arlo knows it, when Libby and Buck earn the privilege to do so, he still can't even muster the bravery to adequately feed the chickens in his coup.After a task to trap a hungry critter, who turns out to be a feral young boy, that is robbing them of their food for the winter ends in calamity for the family, Arlo winds up straying far away from his home into uncharted and dangerous territory. In order to get back, he needs to muster the courage to find his way home, assisted by the likes of the same feral boy who was once stealing from his family.""The Good Dinosaur"" features some of the most bizarre characters this side of a Disney film, including a dazed, meditative rhino, a restless pair of dinosaur brothers and sisters, and some cowboy dinosaurs that act like loose canon outlaws. Anybody who thought the onslaught of ""Cars"" characters we had to endure were strange should see this film and compare their notes. This wouldn't be such a glaring perplexity if ""The Good Dinosaur"" wasn't trying to be rather blunt with its humor like ""Cars 2"" one moment, but then more sort-spoken and harmonious in flow and style like ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" the next.With that, the general vibe of this film is almost unacceptably generic, as the same tired morals of family, being brave/masculine, and leaving one's legacy on a community are constantly reiterated as if they are somehow refreshing ideas. Sure these are valid morals children of any age can use, but compare them to the ideas communicated in ""Inside Out."" That film showed the complexities of being a young girl, thrust into a situation few could adequately handle emotionally at such a young age, and one that handled depression, conflicting emotions, and recurring sadness in a way that could be communicated to children of any age.While ""The Good Dinosaur"" is innocuous fun, and features luscious animation (though sometimes the photorealism becomes too close to a Disneynature visual spectacle than an animated film) throughout, it shouldn't be so easily and readily accepted by an audience spoiled with such greatness as ""Inside Out"" this same year. Even ""Monsters University,"" an often shortchanged project in terms of its themes, serves as better entertainment and more significance than this. ""The Good Dinosaur"" is like giving somebody who loves freshly basked pie with a secret ingredient off-brand, store bought/packaged pie and telling them, ""just pretend for now, while we work on something else."" NOTE: The short before this film, ""Sanjay's Secret Team,"" an alleged true story revolving around a small Indian boy who takes up mediating after being forced to by his father, operates on much of the same plane as this feature film; it's boldly stylistic and colorful, but offers depressingly little sustenance in the face of others before it. I surprisingly didn't lava it.","

"OlieRendch","1 December 2015","The Good Dinosaur is a film that has been in the making for four years. Being a Pixar movie I was excited, and it was about dinosaurs which I love; then due to a lot of story problems and various people leaving the project, it was eventually pushed all the way back to November 2015. Now it's here and I get to review it.To start off I'll go straight for the things I enjoyed about The Good Dinosaur. The animation is some of the best animation I have seen in my life; the textures, the rain, the landscapes, everything about the look of this movie is stunning, some of which is so well- done it looks real. It is all shown brilliantly as well through the directing, which Wikipedia tells me was done by Peter Sohn, a long- time employee of Pixar.Now for the things I did not enjoy about The Good Dinosaur. If you go into this movie, do not expect award-winning material or a unique family experience, like we've come to expect from Pixar. Instead get ready for a bland, cliché and sometimes inappropriate story. It's about a young dinosaur called Arlo who is separated from his family and must find his way home, this could be interesting and give us some fun adventures but for me, it just wasn't. Despite the fact that it took forever to get going, Arlo's journey was the same thing over and over again which is that he is scared by something, and then more scared and then scared by something else and is constantly followed by a human boy who for some reason acts like a dog. I may be to harsh but there were very few scenes I found entertaining, don't get me wrong, they were some, but few and far between. Also, for a movie about dinosaurs it doesn't actually feature that many dinosaurs, and the ones our main character, Arlo, does meet are walking stereotypes we've seen hundreds of times. And I don't want to spoil it but does the line ""I drowned him in my blood"" belong in a kids movie? I don't have kids so I'm just throwing that out there. In the end, it pains me to say that Pixar's The Good Dinosaur did not overcome it's behind the scenes disasters and so I have to give it a 4.5/10.","

"ModishMovies","27 February 2018","This is a very sweet, sentimental film and was very refreshing from Pixar. The latest Pixar films have been either disappointing or too focused on being great instead of fun and enjoyable. I am in the minority of people who didn't enjoy Inside Out. I didn't find it very relatable or emotional and thought the story was contrived. That's where The Good Dinosaur succeeds. It doesn't try to be relatable. It does try to be emotional, and succeeds occasionally, but for the most part, it's just a fun, lighthearted adventure film.The Good Dinosaur doesn't try to overreach its status to be considered truly ""great."" It knows what it is and perfectly nails what it does best. People often hate Pixar when they make a film that is different. People hated Cars 2 because it had a story that wasn't trying to touch childhood emotions, but instead create childhood memories for the children who watch it. Brave was criticized for having a princess heroine like regular Disney animated films. People, I suspect, don't like The Good Dinosaur because it doesn't easily fit into every childhood memory or emotionally impact everyone who watches it. My only major problems with this film is that the story isn't always engaging. It has a few plot developments or character introductions that I found unnecessary to the overall structure of the film. Aside from the story, the animation was stunning and made it easier for me to enjoy watching the film. The animation is more simple and lovable than Pixar's most recent attempt at making a ""great"" film, Coco. Where Coco strives for complex, layered shots and animation, The Good Dinosaur is simple, digestible, and realistic (the backgrounds) while still being ridiculous enough to appeal to young kids. Expectations are subverted and common animation movie tropes are avoided. Even the first human child in the film is basically turned into a dog. If this could be appreciated for what it is, and not what it isn't, this could also be a considered a great film, despite its missteps.3.5/5 stars","

"josiahliljequist","25 November 2015","I came into this movie with tempered expectations (thinking it would be the B-grade pixar movie this year.) I still walked out of the theater disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the animation is gorgeous and the visuals are possibly the best we've seen in an animated movie. But I don't go to watch a movie to see how realistic the scenery is, I want to watch a movie that's funny, heartfelt, and has those favorite characters we're all used to loving from pixar. To me, this movie had none of those things. Sure there were a few funny moments, but nothing that would elicit more than a few chuckles. And even though this movie tried (and I mean really tried) to have an emotional element to the story, I don't think you get to know the characters enough to even care about what happens to them. And then, perhaps the biggest weakness of all, there are only two characters that are in the majority of the movie (and only one character that actually talks) and not enough side characters to keep it interesting. This is a movie that I just wouldn't be interested in watching again and that, I fear, is the biggest criticism of all.","

"lazydaznc","6 March 2016","We took our 4.5 yr old to see this movie and we all loved it. The story line takes you through all your emotions from tears to laughing. Adorable. Even my husband kept saying ""wow that was a great movie!"". The family dynamics portrayed in the film were great. The struggle that a child, that maybe isn't as successful as their siblings, goes through is perfect. The friendship with a creature different from oneself is such a valuable message. The struggles to fit within a family and outside of a family are real. This movie highlights all of it in a sweet and sometimes harsh manner, which is just like life. Overall worthy of a 10.","

"jdonalds-5","25 November 2015","We saw a preview of The Good Dinosaur at Disney World on Nov 6th. Based on that I couldn't wait to see it in full. The preview was adorable and funny. Sadly I think we saw the best parts in the preview.There is no doubt the graphics were superb in The Good Dinosaur. Only for the briefest moment in one scene did I see a weakness in the CGI. Things that a few years ago were not possible, water and hair, were as close to real life as I've ever seen, and there was a lot of both in the movie. The terrain, crops, trees, etc were even more enhanced because the dinosaurs were more like a child's rubber play toy, contrasting the sharpness and high quality of the rest of the scene. But as another reviewer said I don't go to see a kid's movie for the CGI.This movie just didn't have the humor and light-heartedness of the typical Disney/Pixar movie. 10% of it was heartwarming, funny or touching. There was a bit of a moral but it was so smothered by the rest of the story I'm not sure young children will get it. The rest of it was filled with despair, animals brutally attacking each other, dark skies, and more. It just didn't seem like a children's movie.I did see two families leave the theater during the movie. There can always be other reasons for leaving, but I don't think I've ever seen anyone leave a movie as a whole family before.My almost six year old was bored. He has the capacity to lock on to a video but he was not locked on to The Good Dinosaur. I will not be recommending this movie to friends, will not be buying the movie, and will not watch it a second time.","

"Seraphion","13 December 2015","I was planning to write a full fledged article reviewing this movie on my blog, but then cancelled it. For a Pixar movie, The Good Dinosaur stand very far, particularly on the bad side, from the others Pixar had produced. The story base feels interesting. It felt like it could make a great comedy. Yet it failed to do more than just simple laughs. The animation feels nice, but the whole story is a mess. It's definitely not for kids as there's a lot of negative values hidden in plain sight. The movie literally reverse the role of pets and human owner, as with Spot and the four-limb-walking Arlo. There's also a lot of intrinsic violence here and there. And the ghost scene is just weird. The voice acting is quite decent, but the dialog feels flat in overall.","

"Aleta_Nook","25 December 2015","I was expecting Pixar to continue getting better and better with their films after their slump with ""Cars 2"" (something I haven't seen but have heard bad things about) but this one was just worse and less interesting than Inside Out. Though, Inside Out was fine, The Good Dinosaur was just mediocre and uninspired.A small dinosaur named Arlo hatches from eggs along with his brother and sister, Buck and Libby. When the children grow up, their dad promises that Arlo will be brave even though he's scared of everything lurking in the wild. But if the children do something big, they will make their mark.Arlo is probably the most uninspired character I've ever seen. The boy is afraid of everything and is too cutesy. Though, he's not entirely bad but just annoying. I cannot give my two cents to the supporting characters since they were not developed nor on-screen enough for me to even care about. But I really like no character. The best one is probably Spot, he's the main character but he was just okay, he was a clichéd feral child in a boy-and-his-dog reversed story. The characters were too cartoonish.The background is realistic, almost like it was shot on camera and that it was the real world. The animation is also pretty good for some parts but the dinosaur designs were cartoonish and they didn't fit the background.But why would Pixar show characters hallucinating from fruit? I like how the film managed to have a lot of tension, though it's probably not for sensitive children under 12. I don't think it's that dark, if an 8-year- old is mature enough to go, then I suggest they'd try it. This uninspired movie is too childish for my taste. The movie scared me, though.Even they didn't do much with the premise of the asteroid destroying the dinosaurs, the beginning was rushed. But there is little development throughout this, like why are humans acting like dogs?Overall, this movie is safe and uncreative, a disappointment from Pixar.","

"petra_ste","15 April 2016","Much like its young protagonist at the beginning, this movie is a cute little thing which suffers by comparison with more talented siblings. There is nothing terribly wrong with The Good Dinosaur, a solid coming-of-age story with beautiful visuals... only, it falls short next to Pixar's masterpieces like Toy Story, Up, Finding Nemo, Wall-E, Monsters, Inc.The premise is inventive and compelling in a Pixar-ish way, an alternate history where 65 million years ago the fateful meteorite missed Earth and dinosaurs evolved as the dominant species. The Good Dinosaur follows young, fearful Apatosaurus Arlo (Raymond Ochoa), lost in the wilderness, as he makes a dangerous jorney home while bonding with a feral human kid he names ""Spot"".What separates great Pixar movies from good ones is a main premise milked to its full potential, with a story deeply connected to the main theme. For example, in Toy Story the characters being toys isn't incidental, it's the crucial element of their adventures, dangers and fate (such as Andy growing up and abandoning them); Wall-E's narrative power hinges on the little robot being the last inhabitant of a devastated Earth; the main conflicts of Inside Out can only take place in a teenager's mind.Like Brave, The Good Dinosaur's plot has a more generic connection to its thematic backbone (in the latter's case, growing up and overcoming fears). This could easily have been a western with Arlo as a young human teen and Spot as his dog - in fact, the movie heavily homages westerns in tone and feel, and also with characters such as Sam Elliott's Tyrannosaurus cowboy.Compare this to Ratatouille, not even one of my favorite Pixar films but with true brilliance in the *specificity* of its premise: a story of talent and dreams versus conventions which could not have been, indifferently, about a cat who wants to play the piano or a monkey who wants to paint - it NEEDS to be about a RAT who wants to COOK. The main scenario is not interchangeable: if you swap it, Ratatouille just doesn't work.Still, The Good Dinosaur is a lovely little adventure - not groundbreaking but pleasant, a safe entry among classics.7/10","

"Giacomo_De_Bello","25 November 2015","A very underwhelming entry in the Pixar canon. And a strangely unfitting movie for the studio itself. It really strays a lot away for many, almost basic Pixar standards and that is also an element that really left me confused.Straight up from the animation this doesn't really look like a Pixar movie. It isn't really remarkable as 95% of their other films. Yes the landscapes look crystal clear and the detail in things like water and leaves is stunning, but I found the character animation and design to be really underdeveloped, not to mention, tonally weird. For example I couldn't make sense of how the T-Rexs were designed in this film, it was way too distracting. Throughout the film there is this problem which I really found surprising in a Pixar film, because that's a department in which they have rarely even got it wrong for me.Now that is definitely a problem, but the real problem with the film is its overall story and characters. They sometimes edge boredom and that is really not what you'd expect. In the beginning I thought I was giving the film too much of a hard time, but as the story progresses and finally ends I realized I was right from the start. ""The Good Dinasour"" is insanely predictable and standard. With way too many seen before moments and concepts. Story and emotional beats are hardly ever engaging or original. There is really, really little that can be pointed out in the story department that actually has substance or heart. Now that I come to think of it, this film is really forgettable.Fortunately, even if all of the above is present, there is also a levity and good intended spirit that makes the film much more enjoyable that it could have been. The animation design might not be excellent, but the cinematography is pleasant and interesting. The basic dynamic between Arlo and Spot is freshly entertaining and the whole story is wrapped in a package where, despite being bored at times, you will never be angry at the film and will flow with it until the end. Whilst the visual storytelling sometimes is an abyss away from the Pixar standard and others it is used to convey concepts in a terribly cheese way, the majority of it is mildly admirable.There you have it. This is an innocent little movie with some good to it, but that is miles away from what you except when going to see something with the pixar name on it.","

"christianakara","2 December 2015","Probably the worst animated film I ve seen the last decade. What annoyed me most was the fact that Pixar decided to use a very common plot such as ""farm boy lost in the wild try to find its way to home with the help of a wild animal"" but in order to mix it a bit and attract more audience, the farm boy ended up to be a dinosaur and its wild pet a human...For real? Is this a dinosaur movie? Seeing dinosaurs behaving like humans and humans as wild animals isn't what I call a plot!It is just disturbing! Moreover, the fact that Pixar decided that the evolved dinosaurs would create human-like societies instead of following a different path shows lack of imagination! Everyone loves dinosaurs because they represent something exotic in our minds, humanizing dinosaurs at this level is just disgusting!","

"enilenis","8 December 2015","No point talking about the quality of visuals. This is Pixar, so you know exactly what to expect.Plot wise, the story is called ""The Good Dinosaur"". Revolves around a create who tries to earn his mark - the rite of passage, by doing something good.And how does he accomplish that? First, by causing the death of his father and blaming it on a human creature he was supposed to protect the food from. Then while the dinosaur goes on his little adventure, the family is left to starve, taking care of their crop field without a breadwinner. Though his journey the dinosaur naively exposes a small creature to vultures, who violently devour him in front of his eyes. He nearly loses his human companion to the same group of predators. Redemption does come, if one is to ignore that the dinosaur selfishly denied the creature the chance to re-unite with his own kind earlier, which would've prevented the whole ordeal.He also encounters a group of T-Rex ranchers who tend a flock of buffalo's. The dinosaur helps them recover their lost herd, after being explicitly threatened by the head T-Rex. I can assure you, those carnivores don't raise buffalo's as pets, but unlike the vultures they somehow get to be the good characters in this movie.When the journey ends, the dinosaur earns his mark, which might work from the audience's perspective, but if you judge him by the merits of his family all he's really done is abandon them with no prior warning. The good dinosaur left and came back later without a father just in time for the harvest. A true hero! I give the movie 2 stars. 1 for outstanding graphics and 1 for manipulative tear-jerk moments that worked as intended. The movie may be inappropriate for smaller kids due to occasional violence.As for the lessons it teaches kids, the best one, I guess, is not to trust vultures... when they try squeezing $15 out of you for a movie ticket.","

"kgprophet","14 December 2015","News had come a while back that this film was in trouble. The story wasn't working and a rehaul was undertaken. What we get is a weak and conventional film that has all the hallmarks of a Disney film and little of the Pixar magic. The first troubling thing that happens is before the film even begins; a special introduction by the new director. He mentions how this film pays homage to the big upset moments that happened in other Disney films, specifically Bambi (the mother dying and all). What it comes off as instead is an attempt to address the criticisms about the number of scary moments there are in the film. One of the central problems with the film is that it is a story aimed at kids 10 and younger, but is rated PG instead of G. Yet the older audiences will wince at the way too cute renderings of the dinosaurs, and lengthy scenes of kids at play. Another central problem is the thin story. A great effort is made to wow you with spectacular backgrounds (mountain ranges, floods, hot water springs, torrential storms, rapid rivers, iconic sunsets), almost as way to cover for the simple story. My first observation was that the small child character was underdeveloped. The kid is depicted as a small dog, which is a fun spin on how humans are normally perceived. However, there is no development to the kids character, and very little background is revealed. Finally, at the very end of the film, some connections are made for the kid. But more should have been revealed much earlier in the film to help bring depth to the child character.Which leaves the main character, a pretty cliché amalgam of all the weak children who have to face their fears to finally become a man (or an adult dinosaur). From Finding Nemo to The Lion King, nothing feels fresh about the story. I will say I rarely got bored, with the help of enough supporting characters appearing during the course of the film to find new energy and new danger. I am not a parent, but I didn't notice anything absolutely inappropriate in terms of peril. I actually thought there might be more of a concern of small kids emulating the wild child and start climbing cliffs or eating rotten fruit. ""Kids, don't do this at home"". Once the very dark and dangerous journey had played out, I though out loud (I was alone at this screening) that I would rather watch ""Up"" again than spend time with ""The Good Dinosaur"". ""Up"" had far more humour and more to offer for adults. The appeal of dinosaurs is also a non-factor. With the dinosaurs of ""Jurrasic World"" so realistic looking, the claymation look of these dinosaurs underwhelm. I did enjoy the nod to the makers of ""Wallace and Gromit"", by mimicking the goofy faces they made famous (see ""Chicken Run""). The music was generic as most everything else with this film. As an adult, the only thing that kept me daydreaming at times was trying to figure some of the logic holes. Like, if the family will starve if they don't finish the harvest in time, why don't the two other siblings help the little dinosaur? Or, how come the mud footprints they make on the rocks don't wash away in the frequent rainstorms? For adults who go see this film, you can keep yourself occupied by admiring the terrifically rendered landscapes. My guess is that the background artists had time to put extra touches in the landscapes while story changes were being made, and the film benefits from it. But word of mouth seems to indicate the the target audience is either too scared or too bored. Still, I would say it's better than say, ""Cars 2"" or ""Brave"".","

"SnoopyStyle","8 July 2016","The asteroid misses Earth and the dinosaurs don't go extinct. Millions of years later, they have evolved some more. A family of Apatosaurus are farming next to a river at the base of Claw Mountain. They have three kids, Libby, Buck, and the runt Arlo. The father is trying to catch a critter stealing their food. Arlo lets the critter escape which turns out to be a human boy. The father is killed trying to recapture him. Arlo and the boy are washed down the river. Arlo names the boy Spot and they journey to return home.It is not the best Pixar but it still has its DNA. It's not the first to anthropomorphize dinosaurs. It's better than Ice Age. At least, it's more daring. However, it doesn't take it far enough. It may be better for the dinosaurs to evolve into a more humanoid stage. The predator prey distinction is not always dealt with correctly. Arlo's fear of everything gets a little annoying. This is better than most but not the best.","

"Troy_Campbell","28 December 2015","Pixar's form has been mixed of late. For a long time they couldn't put a single foot wrong, yet in the last few years it seems that for every hit (Toy Story 3, Brave) there was a let down (Cars 2, Monsters University) just around the corner. Now, only a few months after the sublime Inside Out, comes this incredibly light and often meandering effort that lacks the wit and ingenuity present in most Pixar feature films. The movie follows an always-frightened Apatosaurus, Arlo (Raymond Ochoa), as he treks through the wilderness to return home, facing his fears and forming a bond with human ""critter"" Spot (Jack Bright) in the process. The premise is extremely basic even for a kid's flick, with the story offering very little in the way of surprises or originality. Disappointingly, the layer of adult-targeting amusement is absent and there's a dearth of humour in general. My God it looks amazing though. Boasting phenomenal CGI environments that blur the line between animation and real life, the photorealistic vistas partially compensate for the narrative blandness. The Good Dinosaur isn't a complete flop, but it sits squarely in the lowest tier of Pixar productions.","

"thenza","7 January 2016","I been to many bad movies of course: this one was one for obvious reasons 1. poorly thought out story/dialogue 2. character development that didn't climb/arch or was relevant at all. Those things can happen in any bad movie of course, but this movie pushed the boundary of a bad movie in the case that it was the first movie my nearly 3 year old son saw with me at theaters; which ultimately made me harbor resentment towards the writers and story directors for a number of reasons. I am nearly 30 and my son nearly 3 and I don't find myself to be an overly protective parent when it comes to what he views (of course I am against unnecessary violence, the poor treatment of others, and things that would unnerve myself if I was a child things ANY parent would more than likely agree on) with that being stated this movie was completely inappropriate for kids. Firstly the Hindu story at the beginning was an interesting after thought in completion but the fact that the kid is trapped to fight some horrible monster immediately scared my son who isn't usually scared of monsters or situations in other movies, so immediately I felt it went a bit far and shouldn't have even been a part of the movie in the first place. Given that I gave it a pass as just being an unnecessary story about surpassing fears and embracing peace a concept I don't think a 2-3 year old would grasp I now move onto the movie itself... Surpassing fears is one thing but exposing my son to a dinosaur movie that circled around the killing of other animals in a malicious manner, a supposed drug trip scene, scene after scene about feeling helpless and showing that you have to fight others in order not to be victimized are basic values that I would never teach my son. The scenes were not endearing or funny, it showed struggle and plight, a dinosaur being knocked out, his leg being hurt when told to be strong in stalking and killing his enemy a human child... and being teased by siblings while later having a pet human who doesn't speak.. but rather that bites everyone are not reliable or enjoyable things to show to a child. Or a story that an older dinosaur told about drowning a crocodile in his own blood? I wouldn't want to expose my son to fear in this sense of the word, yes dinosaurs are scary but the overall frame of this movie was not about surpassing fear it was about dealing with it as a necessary evil and I do not believe in that, i relate it to telling my son a scary story and turning off the lights saying deal with it. Granted he wasn't scared during the movie but more so bored, I WAS DISMAYED that I had to expose him to 3 pterodactyl animals tearing apart an animal as entertaining when it was revolting, or a father who is teaching his son how to be a strong man by killing someone who is trying to eat to survive. This movie was a failure in my book for all parties. All he could say towards the end was ""watch pandas"" as he saw a poster for another movie earlier. I feel bad that this had to be his first movie experience and that he had to feel fear or a lack of entertainment just because the writers and story editors couldn't grasp what are good values or depictions of characters should be. I also feel bad for all the other parents who had a similar experience that in the hopes that your child likes dinosaurs so much that you had to pay the markers of this movie money based on that marketing scheme just to find out that you were paying for something you would not want to expose to your child. Finally, As a viewer and not a parent I can say that a dinosaur getting lost for an hour just to end up where he started is not a movie and seeing the characters victimize each other only to learn NOTHING in nature or life besides you have to fight/you have to fend for yourself falls extremely flat under these circumstances.. THAT IS NOT COURAGE THAT IS NOT A LIFE OF A DINOSAUR, THAT IS PLIGHT.","

"Quinoa1984","24 November 2015","This may seem like I liked the movie quite a lot by my star rating, and I did... for what it is. And what it is is Pixar not going quite as far as they usually do. It was hard for me, I have to admit, to not take into account that it's almost a miracle the movie made it to screens at all - it's been in production for 6 years (which for Pixar may not seem like a long time, but it is), and the original director and cast were replaced and the release date pushed back twice over the past two years (it was supposed to come out *before* Inside Out to give you an idea). What could've been may be a question for documentarians to come, but for now we have what's before us and it is... familiar kids stuff that is at often times odd, inexplicable, and achingly beautiful in its scope and simplicity.The story starts off with an asteroid that should destroy the dinosaurs missing the Earth, and it cuts to ""Millions of Years Later"", and we have our main characters as... dinosaurs who are farming their corn harvest. We follow little Arlo, who is the smallest and cowardly of three dinosaur babies hatched at the start, and he seems to be afraid of everything and can't help with the corn. His dad tries to boost up his courage, but on a walk in the rain along a river to get his gusto up, he falls into a massive river-flood and dies. Then Arlo too later on falls into a river (not during a flood) and gets knocked on the head, far a way from home, and with the little human runt who started a lot of this mess - he was stealing some of the stash of corn - and so, at first a rather 'odd couple', they have to find their way back home.So as you can imagine from how I just summarized this, the story is rather goofy and weird. Also, the first part of the story was not something that I really grasped from how the filmmakers show it - when I got home I saw a video from Neil Degrasse Tyson who put the asteroid-missing-Earth 'what-if' scenario in context and *then* it made sense - and while I didn't really take too much stock in dinosaurs and (albeit early/cave-man type) humans co-existing as it is, you know, a cartoon, it made things in perspective. The main part I mean of that is... why are they dinosaurs? Why do they have to be that for this story? There are other dinosaurs in the story; eventually, I should note, as they aren't really variations (including the closest thing to a villainous threat aside from Mother Nature itself in the form of a-hole pterodactyls), until halfway through the story. But it just seems random that they are farming for corn and the only thing I caan chalk it up to is the good ol' Joseph Campbell hero mythology (after all, Luke Skywalker was a farm boy too, so...) The other thing about The Good Dinosaur is that it's simple. It does have little moments of comedy, but not really, and the director and animators rely on physical action and reaction for the most part. And the movie does have its moments that stick out - Sam Elliott voicing a T-Rex who has a *story* about how he got the bite marks on his face is one such amazing thing to recommend about it - but so many things that happen are odd for such a movie. At one point little Arlo meets a triceratops (I think that's who it was) who has a squad of little animals that he's named as like ""Destroyer"" and ""Diane"" or whatever as his protectors. OK... And then Arlo and 'Spot' (as Arlo names the little cave-boy) eat some berries which turn out to be, uh, psychedelic berries. OK then. And there's just some dialog that straddles a line between being very kid-friendly and being on some other plane altogether.The quest here has been seen many times before, and aside from other Pixar movies, with the 'finding our way back home' scenario (hell, this was the basis for Inside Out just this year), one has to think about The Land Before Time as well. Remember Littlefoot trying to get back to his family and separated by so much land and nature? That's pretty much this movie, except kind of a buddy/family movie and with a different nature-filled backdrop. It goes without saying the animation is gorgeous - the day the animation for a Pixar movie is crap (or lazy) then it will really slip off. While the designs for Arlo and Spot and some of the other dinos aren't the most original, the backdrop more than makes up for it, and if you're simply a fan of animated films for the technique this is must-see stuff.For the story, however, it doesn't really strike the balance wholly for adults and kids, which is why as *family* entertainment The Good DInosaur is less than great. For little kids this will certainly be a treat, it has a big heart and a message that they can relate to, but I can only speak for myself in saying that it's not the strongest stuff Pixar's put out as far as finding something really *new*. But then it's also Pixar, so the standards may be so high by this point that for any other studio this would be their crowning jewel.","

"MissSimonetta","26 March 2016","The Good Dinosaur (2015) may not be top of the line Pixar, but it's still pretty darn good. An aesthetically pleasing fairy tale quest about courage and friendship, the kind one could easily see Don Bluth making in the 1980s. While the first ten minutes are a bit twee and on the whole, the plot is predictable, this is a warm, well-made movie, with the journey emphasized over the end destination.Alas most parents find the frightening elements of the film reason to give it one star reviews. How petty. Imagine if this mindset were applied to the great children's films, like Disney's Pinocchio (which critic Leonard Maltin once described as a nightmarish fantasy with comic interludes) or Bluth's The Secret of NIMH (a movie with horrific elements that make the most intense parts of The Good Dinosaur look like Care Bears material) or that granddaddy of children's cinema, The Wizard of Oz (1939), which had Dorothy and her friends menaced by all kinds of terrors.My point is, just because a kid's movie is scary does not mean it is unsuitable for children. This is a movie about overcoming fear; of course a lot of it is going to be frightening. But even then, none of it is nearly as frightening as the blue monkeys from Oz or the lab flashback scenes in NIMH. Give your kids more credit! If you coddle them with harmless, electric baby sitter entertainment forever, how can you ever expect them to face the unsavory aspects of the real world?","

"cbrownlaw-771-107746","7 December 2015","Wonderful animation of the backgrounds, but worst Pixar movie so far, and I hope worst ever. Again, animation was stunning of the backgrounds, as advertised. However, the animation of the main characters was awkward - looked more like a Wallace and Gromit head stuck on a crayon drawn body. Was there a score? Someone forgot to pay the musicians/composers? Never funny, never creative in dialogue, no heart. Never liked the dinosaur's family, never had any dealings with ""Spot's"" family. HUGE holes. Plot was rarely original, and when it was original, it was bad. No heart, no care with the characters, complete rip-off from ""Land before time."" Same main character from ""Land Before time"", about same age, and (1) young ""long neck"" dinosaur, (2) parent dies, (3) cut off from herd, (4) gets together with former foes, and (5) learns to survive with help of foe turned friend, with (6) various dinosaurs trying to eat him. The western dinosaurs were original - amazingly stupid ""western dinosaur"" scene in the middle - but original. No connection of any of the worlds - the farming, the ranching, the humans - just haphazard. Just no care taken to make you like anyone, other than the two main characters. I judge movies by ""do I want to watch it again,"" and this movie is ""wish I had missed.""","

"Silfiriel","16 January 2016","I was hesitant about this title anyways, but thinking it's a Pixar film I wasn't expecting to be this bad. An unoriginal story full of clichés and bad dialog. The idea that humans and dinosaurs living together at the same point of time in history is fine I guess, but it is very badly executed. The humans walk like monkeys but howl like wolves and act like dogs!? Really? And the dinosaurs are human in every aspect. OK, maybe it's a good movie for ages 2-6. At some point it's got the Ice Age vibe, bit based on the story not the quality of the movie. So, this is one of the worst animated films lately and not just by Pixar standards, it feels like everybody who was creative in Pixar left the company and now it only operates with animation hobbyists. The only good thing about it is hat it only lasts 85 minutes, credits not included.","

The ""Shock"" Factor is then not as ""Shocking"" for the Little Folks.There have been many other ""Kids"" Movies, even from the Distant Past, like ""Bambi"" (1942) and ""Old Yeller"" (1957), just to name Two of the Many, that had a Strong Emotional Impact on Children.This Film has been ""Shamed"" by a number of People for being too Violent for Kids. Although there are a Few Scenes of ""Natures Way"" included here that will most likely pass by for ""Well Adjusted"" and Unsheltered Children, other Kids could find it Scary.Actually the Movie is more Sad than Scary. In Fact, it is Extremely Sad. But Unlike Real-Life there is the Inevitable ""Happy Ending"". So all's Right with the World. No Worries. In the End Pixar has made another Incredible Animated Movie that is Loaded with Stunning Imagery, and a Simple Story of Family, Fear, and Finding one's way in a Wild World.Entertaining and Rich with Emotion, and some Off-Beat Photo Realism that is Complex and Completely Captivating.

"elsol-3","14 February 2016","I'm still giving this movie a 3 out of 10, simply because of the setting visuals which are spectacular without a doubt. But all the wonderful rendering in the world cannot save a fumbling clichéd plot and weak characters.Stereotyped characters that are at their weakest (Pixar's former worst effort in this regard was in Cars 2) are the worst offenders here. There's a distinct lack of real character development that makes you want to connect with the protagonist - or anyone - in this film. This isn't what I would expect from Pixar.The main character rendering is so at odds with the gorgeous backgrounds, that it feels more like a demo reel for scenery rendering than a movie. If as much love and attention was put into the rendering of the characters, it would have been a step in the right direction towards redeeming the story... but there is the biggest flaw of all.The story is hackneyed, clichéd, old, tired... and nothing is brought to the table to make it stand out in any way at all. Just because you swap the characters of a Boy And His Dog movie to be a Dino And His Human, it's not enough, not nearly enough to make the story special. So much potential was wasted. And for a world populated predominantly by dinosaurs, the entire world feels so *empty*. We meet a bare handful of dinosaurs. I get that the story is set in the ""wilderness"", but whilst the Plant kingdom is rendered in all its glory, Kingdom Animalia is basically no-where to be seen, resulting in a sterile, lifeless environment for the most part.Pixar should have shelved this story, and never bothered bringing it to theaters, cut their losses, and moved onto something else.","

I don't think the film is terrible. The backgrounds are some of the best I've ever seen. It really submerges you into its world. Some of the designs of the animals are realistic and cool looking. The score is phenomenal, even rivaling Inside Out's.But the praise stops there. The main problem I have with the film is that it's SO DANG LAZY!!!! It is literally Big Hero 6 crossed with Finding Nemo. You can predict the plot within the first few minutes of the movie. It's the same ""boy and his dog try to find their at home"" story we've seen millions, no, billions of times. C'mon, Pixar (and movie industry in general)! Can't we just move on from this freaking story?The characters are no more than two dimensional and very forgettable. They don't portray any emotion. Oh the irony, Pixar. The humor is either non-existent or to kiddy like. There isn't anything really to engage anyone older than let's say, 9 years old.The designs of the dinosaurs are atrocious. I tired of the gummy, overly cartoony look. Give them some feathers already! Even the 2000 movie DINOSAUR did the designs better!To sum up, it's for the most part a visual treat, but not story-wise. This is strictly a kids film or a 3D nut's film.Premise: 3/10 Writing: 4/10 Characters: 5/10 Visuals: 7/10Final Score: 4.5/10(I decided to be nice and round it up to a 5 for the IMDb score).","

"Tweekums","20 March 2019","This film takes place in a world where the dinosaurs didn't go extinct sixty five million years ago. It is set around the time of the first Stone Age people and the dinosaurs are farming. The story is centred on Arlo, a nervous young Apatosaurus. He tries to help on the farm but is scared of the chickens he is meant to feed and is weaker than his siblings. After a tragedy strikes, the family struggle somewhat; then as Arlo confronts a 'critter' stealing their corn both of them fall into the river. He finds himself far from home. He gradually befriends the critter, a young boy he later names Spot. On their journey home they will face a variety of perils as well as meet other dinosaurs; some friendly, others dangerous.Having heard some fairly negative reviews I nearly skipped this; I'm glad I didn't. It may not be up there with the best of Pixar's works but it is a charming little story with fun central characters. Spot, a boy who acts more like a dog provides most of the laughs while the viewer sympathises with Arlo and his plight. There are some fairly dark moments that may upset or scare younger children; these don't feel out of place though and add to the excitement for older viewers. The animation was good, as one might expect. At first I was unsure about the contrast between the cartoony characters and the almost photo-realistic high quality backgrounds but as I watched they grew on me... more realistic dinosaurs would have been too scary in some scenes and lower quality backgrounds wouldn't have captured the grandeur of the setting. Overall I found this to be a charming film; it may be considered a 'lesser' Pixar film but to my mind it is still worth watching.","

"ncarolina-43197","30 November 2015","I took my 4 year old daughter to see this movie because she loves dinosaurs. After seeing the previews I thought she would really enjoy it and It seemed like it would be a safe and entertaining child's movie. It appeared to me it would be like a Finding Nemo but with dinosaurs. I was WRONG. The creators started out on the right path but then in a blink of an eye sent it burning to the ground. *SPOILER* the scene that really ruined it for me was when the boy and the dinosaur ate the rotten fruit which made them trip out and hallucinate. The first few minutes were tolerable but then it just kept getting weirder and weirder. It was a completely worthless scene that was inappropriate for a child's movie, regardless of the point the film makers were trying to make. There are plenty of other ways they could have made their point without sending a child's character through a shroom induced trip. If that wasn't enough the violence and language was out of line for a child's movie as well. Stuff like ""I'm going to kill you"" and ""I drowned him in my own blood"" I mean seriously? If I had known that there was scenes and language like this I would have never taken my 4 year old to see this. I had really high hopes for this, it's sad that there are adults especially in the film making business that think content like that is appropriate for children.","

But I should know by now not to do that, because I did the same thing with Brother Bear and that's one of my favourite animated movies ever. Ok, to say The Good Dinosaur is also one of my favourites is a bit of a stretch - but I can tell you that it truly is a beautiful movie. The animation is PERFECT; oh wow, it is so gorgeous. Probably the most visually stunning Pixar movie. I don't think the plot is too slow, and I don't think it drags on - rather, I think it's just very simple. Simple does not equal bad. Also, and this is an important one, I relate to Arlo in many ways. I'm sure I'm not the only one, either. It's great to see a main character who genuinely struggles with self-confidence and anxiety and not being able to do anything right. The relationship between Arlo and Spot is adorable too. Spot is such an amazing, underrated character. I love him.I can't believe it took me four years to finally get around to seeing this. But even more than that, I can't believe how much criticism it gets! I wasn't expecting to like this, in fact I actually wanted to hate it. But it was the opposite. I found it so endearing and so emotional. I was sobbing by the end of it. This only proves, once again, that just because majority of a movie's reviews are bad does NOT mean it IS bad. It means all opinions are subjective, and at the end of the day that's what reviews come down to. So I highly recommend this to anyone who loves simple but beautiful stories.","

"CubsandCulture","18 January 2021","This has flashes of the Pixar magic but a couple of big decisions work against the film. First the designs of the characters stands at odds with the backgrounds. The environments are all rendered in photoreal that takes few, if any, liberties with nature. However, the character designs are cartoony. Neither the backgrounds or the characters are bad in themselves but combined they create a tonal clash. Second, Spot (the human character) should not have been played as a dog. The idea is funny for a bit but it wears out its welcome fast. It also robs the friendship at the heart of the film of power. Spot is too goofy to carry the pathos required.It is really a shame that those two decisions were made because I like much of the film. The plot is sparse-it conforms to a survival western-to the point that it is really easy to get lost in the vistas. The casting is spot on-Sam Elliot as grizzled T-Rex for example. Best of all the father/son story really works. Alas the film has its issues.","

"playerazzi","15 December 2015","Any Pixar entry into the world of 3D animation comes with a great deal of baggage. We expect a top-notch movie, with excellent dialogue, an interesting plot, some lessons to be learned, intriguing characters, and cutting-edge animation. So I was disappointed to see only the last item in The Good Dinosaur. The movie deals with a pre-industrial level farm, manned by family of dinosaurs. The farm is located in a Western America type of location, on a little flat piece of ground near a river downstream from some mountains that look like the Grand Tetons.The father and mother work the farm until three children are born, who are expected to help. Arlo - the hero of our story - is the runt of the family, hatched incongruously from the largest egg. Why he was hatched from the largest egg yet is the runt is never explained. His brother Buck and sister Libby - hatched at the same time - manage to carry out their work, and get to leave their mark on the family storage container, yet little Arlo is not able to do this. He feels left out and disappointed. Until - well, something happens, and Arlo and Dad are thrown into a challenge against elements of nature and against man - or rather - dinosaur kind. With a classic scene taken right out of Lion King, and a detour to a Western (T-Rexes gallop like horses), Arlo tries to get back home with the help of a loin-cloth clad ""creature"". This creature is a human boy about 10-ish, crawling on all fours and baying like a wolf. Arlo and Creature try to get home together, but the messages given and emotional challenges are weak and not clear. It's like going on vacation with your family, and if I wanted to go on vacation with my family to Yellowstone National Park, I would have packed the car and headed off, not gone to the movies. The characters are not memorable, there are no cool lines like Inside Out's ""ruined pizza"" line, or many others. In short, I am forgetting this forgettable movie. One thing I will grant it: the scenes of Arlo and others in a river flood were so realistic as to raise the standard of 3d animation once again, which is what Pixar does so well. If that's what you like, then go see this movie. But if you want to see an interesting story and interesting characters, pass on this one.","

"AdrenalinDragon","27 November 2015","As with every Pixar movie, I had high expectations for The Good Dinosaur. Although there's a few decent things going for it, I don't know if I can quite call it genuinely good. There are some problems with it, most likely stemming from its development issues, but it also has quite a bit of heart and emotion to it, and some nice scenes here and there.The movie follows an alternate world where Dinosaurs and Humans live together. A young dinosaur named Arlo unsuccessfully tries to fit in with his family and mark his place, despite having a timid yet cowardice personality. After an unexpected event happens, it leads him to start a friendship with a Caveboy named Spot. He becomes lost and tries to return home.The story is pretty straightforward and some of the humour seems to be aimed more for kids, but it's still funny for adults in places. It is visually stunning, with cartoony animals mixed with realistic backgrounds and reflective waters, and the music is effective when needed to be. Our protagonist Arlo is both likable and relatable, which is always a good thing, and Spot has his moments in short bursts. As for the other characters, Arlo's father will be reminiscent to a certain Disney character, but that's not a bad thing, and the others seem to be not as important to the story, but have some development time in there.I think my biggest problem with The Good Dinosaur is that it feels a little inconsistent and ""Been there, done that"" at times. The first half I feel is stronger than the second, and there's a bit of a homage to a specific genre in there. Most importantly, I cared about the characters, but maybe I was expecting more from Pixar I don't know. I seem to notice the more effective emotional scenes were either the silent ones, or ones that were kind of loosely based on previous Animated movies that popped right in my head at the time of watching, so not being entirely original could be considered a problem to some.Despite the shortcomings, I found The Good Dinosaur entertaining. It's probably in the weaker tier of Pixar movies, but I wouldn't call it bad. It's kind of halfway between average and good, and I feel the troubled production and staff switching caused it to be a mixed bag, although good intentions are clearly shown throughout the movie. Kids will certainly like it, and adults will at the very least appreciate what the movie tried to achieve.6.5/10","

"eddie_baggins","1 August 2016","Pixar as a company have enough runs on the board that the mere mention of their name on a product is usually enough for the average cinema goer to expect a certain degree of quality control over a product and even while their recent ventures like the so-so Brave and the misguided Monsters University haven't exactly lived up to their lofty standards, there was still relatively high expectations of their 2015 Xmas treat The Good Dinosaur, expectations that were sadly not delivered upon.For the first time in the decorated life of Pixar, the company has with The Good Dinosaur produced their first legitimate stinker and while box office receipts remained relatively high for the film, there's little doubt sentiment towards the product was muted at best and while Peter Sohn's (who took over the film late into the piece from original director Bob Peterson) film often looks fantastic in a CGI perspective, the films somehow boring plot line and unmemorable characters work against a typical tale that could've been something quite special but as a finished product is only something the smallest of tykes are going to enjoy.Light on for decent jokes for anyone over the age of 10, barring a particularly random horned dinosaur that has a numerous array of friends accompanying him, while the films message of acceptance and finding oneself in the big wide world feels relatively forced around a story that could've been told far better in a short film format. The other main issue is that scaredy cat young dinosaur Arlo and his eventual travel companion in the form of cave man child Spot aren't overly endearing road (mountain) trip buddies and scenarios like an awkward acid trip and run in with some annoying winged beasts are more weird and annoying that inventive and charming.It also must be mentioned that the design work also of Pixar's team on Arlo and his dinosaur family is some of their weakest work to date, the dinosaurs look cheap and nasty where around them is wonderfully designed landscapes and carefully created scenery, it was no doubt a struggle coming to terms with the looks of these creatures and a struggle that was clearly not won.Not the worst animated film going around but very far from something special, The Good Dinosaur is a distinctively dull entry into Pixar's anything but ordinary catalogue of films and an event that even the most die-hard of Pixar fans would be better off avoiding rather than enduring for the 90 minutes of mediocre material on offer.2 dinosaur homesteads out of 5","

"joavabra","14 February 2016","""The Good Dinosaur"" is probably Pixar's worst movie yet. My family was on a Disney Cruise while this movie was in theaters, so we decided to go see it. The start of the movie was sort of entertaining. But then the ""very unpredictable"" death scene happened and I knew Arlo was about to go on his ""epic journey"". This movie was incredibly boring and not funny at all. The only scene anyone laughed at was that part with those groundhog things were shooting out of the ground (?). Then Arlo and Spot ate some ""Posioness berries"" and had this weird hallucination thing and that whole scene made my whole family uncomfortable (that was the only thing my brother mentioned about the movie, and he didn't mention actually enjoying that scene). Overall, the movie was very boring and nothing compared to movies like toy story 3 and Big Hero 6.","

"GiraffeDoor","10 July 2022","A devastatingly powerful movie about a pair of characters divided not only by race but by language learning to see themselves in each other. The narrative loses nothing from the human character being unable to express himself in a language intelligible to us, but it only gives us a chance to see a fresh type of visual storytelling and communication.With all the other charms it's studio usually gives, there will indeed be a loyal fanbase who will watch this movie as a matter of course.But if you are one of these people that has never really swooned for pixar as much as kids and college students like me did, this is one of the special ones.","

"gedpurvis-332-659799","26 February 2016","OK how many times have we heard this story? Main character ends up lost, finds friend and when confronted by the bad elements of life they discover their inner bravery to steer them ahead in their life. Its not a unique tale but still its told very well by Pixar, the animation is outstanding although the characters seemed a little out of place with their cartoony style but that is easily overlooked by the way the movie moves along.I cannot understand the many bad comments about this film saying it was too dark and scary for kids but people said the same about Return to Oz, Snow white, Pinocchio and even the Lion King and they are now deemed as classics. The Good Dinosaur although not in the same league as The Lion King is just an enjoyable romp and has many great things going for it and I as an adult enjoyed it, its a nice film and cannot see the problem with it being scary for the young ones. Kids are a lot more tougher than some people give them credit for and lest we forget the days of old when we hid behind the sofa sh***ing ourselves because of the monsters from Doctor Who ... This film is nowhere as extreme and deserves better credit as a good wholesome family movie. 8 out of 10 from me.","

"TheMovieDiorama","25 December 2018","Considered by many to be one of Pixar's weakest entries in their illustrious filmography, this family animation may lack narrative memorability but do not let that deter you away. There is a surprising amount of emotion from a story that is mostly told through breathtaking visuals, which should appeal to many. After a tragedy strikes his family, a young dinosaur is swept away by a raging river and loses his mother. Fearful of most things, he must learn to overcome the natural terrors that bask in the foreign environment. The plot is reminiscent of Disney's own 'The Lion King', and does rely heavily on specific details so much that it frequently feels like a weak imitation. An untimely yet heroic demise forces the protagonist to develop and become an adult. We've seen it before. However Pixar is able to overhaul the aesthetics and create an emotionally touching film that is sure to leave many in tears, including my sister who required tissues on two occasions. Dialogue is only spoken from the dinosaurs, given them human characteristics, whereas the primitive cave dwellers resemble wild animals. The small amount of dialogue is voiced decently, especially by Ochoa. This reversal forces the narrative to be told visually for the most part, allowing the majestic landscapes and outstanding animation to be at the forefront. It truly is a stunning picture. One scene in particular, where both Arlo and Spot reveal to each other that they are alone through sticks and sand, was so beautifully told that it made me feel vulnerable. Arlo's journey is emotionally exhausting, and narratively inconsistent with random scenes being stringed together, but remains poignant throughout. It may not be as memorable as Pixar's other excellent additions, yet the refreshing visual storytelling and gorgeous animation ensures that it should not be overlooked. Oh, the score also deserves recognition. Tender, soft and simply exquisite. Just a shame the film was released the same year as 'Inside Out'...","

"Special-K88","18 June 2017","Touching animated feature takes place in an alternate universe where an asteroid never resulted in an extinction level event, and dinosaurs continue to exist. The film chronicles a family of herbivores (two parents, three children) as they attempt to maintain their farming lifestyle. This proves to be an especially daunting task for Arlo, their youngest and most reticent child who is looking to ""make his mark."" Ready or not, soon circumstances force Arlo to find out what he's really made of. While this may not be quite as sophisticated or as memorable as earlier studio efforts, Pixar still manages to tell a simple, heartwarming tale of grit, friendship, family, and the loss of innocence. Lacks a certain resonance, but still features some great vocal work, clever gags, and stellar animation. **½","

"lesleyharris30","30 December 2015","The Good Dinosaur is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific voice cast. It's a very enjoying ninety minutes as we are taken on a journey with Arlo, a young dinosaur, in a world where the species never became extinct, we see a ""boy and his dog"" relationship develop between Arlo and a human boy, who are like wild animals in this universe, it's an interesting, original set up for a movie that gave Pixar a lot of creative space to do as they pleased. I was disappointed that the film didn't establish and develop its universe as much as it could have, I expecting Arlo and Spot to travel far and wide while searching, but we really never feel that far away from home at all. We also aren't introduced to enough dinosaurs, there are only four different species in the whole movie, the trailers really made it seem like there was a big world that they were going to explore, but in the end they barely scratched the surface, it should have been longer, ninety minutes felt tight and the ending was very rushed. The film has a lot of heart, and that ended up being the highlight, Arlo has a complicated relationship with his family, and eventually with Spot, that feels very real, and you will be surprised with how human a talking animated dinosaur real is, I found him very relatable and I think most people will. There are two great messages to this movie, to face your fears and make your mark, and it never forgets these two points, it's a strong, powerful aspect of the story and it was wise to always make it evident, establishing how important both really are. Sweet, funny and very well animated, it may not be Pixar's finest but the Good Dinosaur is still a charming film that I would recommend to anyone looking for something to entertain the whole family. A dinosaur named Arlo makes friend with a young boy who helps him find his way back home safely.","

"Horst_In_Translation","10 December 2015","""The Good Dinosaur"" is an American 90-minute movie from this year. The director is Peter Sohn, a prolific voice actor in other Pixar films and after the very good short film ""Partly Cloudy"", this is his first full feature movie. He also co-wrote with 3 other experienced writers. This is Pixar's take on prehistoric dinosaurs. What if the comet had missed the earth? We follow Arlo, a young dinosaur who wants to prove he is able to help his family and Spot, a little Neanderthal. It was actually funny how these two had switched roles, which means Spot is the pet (acts like a dog) while Arlo is the owner, or I should maybe say the one who is capable of speaking.We meet several other dinosaurs in this film as well, but still I felt this was never about who they were in the biological sense, but about their actions. Some dinosaurs were friendly, where you did not expect it while others were evil, what was a surprise. Well.. not really. It was kinda obvious these flying dinosaurs were searching for weak dinosaurs they could kill easily, but that's fine as they solved this quickly. This film reminded me occasionally of the ""Lion king"" with the father's early death and the flying dinosaurs I just mentioned felt a bit like hyenas, only that one of them was smart.I had some difficulties early on with the fact that the father's death was not really elaborated on, we did not see anybody mourn (especially the siblings) or we did not really learn about the consequences other than the mother having to work much harder now. However, this was made up thanks to the scene with the sticks who stand for the characters' families. It was a very moving moment and, near the end, when Arlo lets Spot go they brought in this reference again and it was truly emotional at this point. I also quite liked the reunion scene. It was expected, but still a thing of beauty. Needless to say anything about the music and animation. It's Pixar, top-notch as always. A great movie, maybe slightly inferior to ""Inside Out"", but nonetheless a great achievement and certainly a contender for best 15 films of 2015. Highly recommended and this one truly made me curious about Sohn's next works.","

"FelipeCarrillo","23 January 2016","""Simplicity is the key to brilliance"" - 'Bruce Lee'. ""Simplicity is the first step of the nature, and the last of the art"" - 'James Bailey'. Two phrases that embody the pure and beautiful that it is ""The Good Dinosaur"". 2015 was a resounding success for Pixar year, with ""Inside Out"" in the first half of the year, as for the second half not going to be easy. but the film went well rid. ""Inside Out"" is full of complexity, colors, deep characters, joy, a real Pixar Movie, ""The Good Dinosaur"" is radiant, with a simple linear plot but even more profound than success at the box office. You could say it isn't the invention more lucrative and embarrassingly wealthy of the producer, however, it is a familiarly rich and rewarding film, with lessons for children and adults. It is absolutely sentimental and highlights within the competing for being more human Disney film. The fact that Pixar released two projects in the same year, apparently would mean production and distribution problems, it was not so, not counting the delay generated by the departure of Bob Peterson of the plan. What have happened if 65 million years ago a meteorite had not finished with the dinosaurs? Yes, right now, we would be dinosaurs and humans, so would exist millions of ""Jurassic Park"" films. After a beautiful birth, Arlo (Jack McGraw and a little more old Raymond Ochoa) strives to meet the expectations of his father, but his fears more intimate do not allow it. Throughout the development of the film characters (prehistoric) are added to the adventure, however is a human child who actually manages to make story, acting sometimes as a secondary character. Dinosaurs' genera are not clearly distinguished, but, What importance does this?. Perhaps they are totally invented or maybe not, better not entering matters paleontologists. The nice colors (for anything equal or similar to the colorful ""Inside Out"") of the creatures are tones obviously suitable, since despite being clear and flat tone, they want that appreciate us the lush landscapes as a field, a barrage seen in reality, ravines and plains touchingly real. Arlo becomes the character more beloved today, When to be beaten, weak, bruised, unprotected, still feels strong to return home. A stunning scene in the river is terribly strong and harrowing. As it is common in the animated films, the fantastic characters acquire qualities and features human, accompanied with story's visual and subjective mood. Disney impresses in this case, reversing the typical story of true friendship 'Dog - Human', where in this situation the human being is the dog and the human is the creature. some touch clichés as, on the road to decay and decaying but throughout these setbacks the friendship begins to emerge. Sentimental, emotional and human of the film is held for a couple of scenes that vividly portray a heart strong and beautiful, softening the heart of all viewers. A viscerally emotive product and substantially full of learning for the family. Defects, errors, effects, successes, are the ones who manage to ""The Good Dinosaur"" to achieve one of the posts more high of the Pixar podium and not for external and visual emotions, is one of the most profound (perhaps the deepest) to achieve the main objective that must have a producer to children ""Teach in family"". Except for the emotional end, the film is full of friendship and family, never feels his solitude, because in all film different prehistoric characters are born, Finally, do less, on this occasion, was truly do a lot more. ""Simple entertainment, but never empty,""The Good Dinosaur "" in moral and human aspects exceeds from head to toe to its predecessor"".","

"CinemaClown","5 December 2015","While the year of 2014 was the first in nearly a decade that didn't feature any film from Pixar Animation Studios, 2015 marks the first time that this pioneering studio has released 2 films in the same year. The first was Inside Out which signalled a much-awaited return to form for Pixar after their quality slump in the past few movies. The second arrived just recently in the form of The Good Dinosaur that employs Pixar's signature thinking process that begins with the idea of ""what if"" and is a technical marvel but purely from storytelling perspective, it's one of their least impressive works.Set in an alternate timeline in which the asteroid that destroyed the dinosaurs missed Earth, The Good Dinosaur introduces a world that's still ruled by these giant reptiles and concerns Arlo; the youngest member of an agrarian family of Apatosaurus who's unable to adjust due to his timid nature. But when a strange set of events separates him from his family & throws him in an unfamiliar territory, Arlo finds an unlikely friend in a human child and takes an epic journey through the wild to return to his home and in the process also learns to confront his fears & discover his true capabilities.Directed by Peter Sohn, who helmed the Pixar short, Partly Cloudy, The Good Dinosaur has bits n pieces of Pixar's patented fusion of breathtaking animation with emotionally resonant storytelling that appeals to viewers of all ages, it falls incredibly short of the high standards this studio itself forged over the course of its existence for the story, characters & humour present in the screenplay is more intended for the younger members in the audience, which isn't really Pixar's thing, and even though its second half makes up for a lot of drawbacks in the previous half, the overall experience still remains more or less underwhelming.If The Good Dinosaur was the product of any other animation studio, nearly everyone would be raving about its 3D animation but since it isn't, this aspect is easily taken for granted for we expect nothing but extraordinary computer animation from the studio that's responsible for the very existence of it in the world of animation filmmaking. And the tradition continues in their latest entry for it is quite possibly their most photorealistic work to date. The picture is breathtaking to look at, each frame is extraordinarily detailed & every image seems highly lifelike. But the characters retain their cartoonish look which, at times, creates friction with its insanely realistic-looking background.But all that jaw-dropping work in the animation process is rendered useless by its unoriginal story, in addition to its surprising inability to make us care for our protagonist. The narrative takes its inspiration from existing classics but is unable to recreate the emotional depth that was so evident in those gems. There's still some creativity & imagination to be found in this flick, as visible in human roles played by different species of dinosaurs. The humour is quite childish, voice acting is finely carried out, the background score by Danna brothers is fitting for the most part, and of all the characters, it's only the human child who is able to impress the most and manages to steal the show, quite effortlessly.On an overall scale, The Good Dinosaur is technically accomplished in every manner but it falls short in the storytelling standards we've come to expect from Pixar Animation Studios. It certainly makes up for an enjoyable, entertaining & family-friendly entertainment but in the long run, I highly doubt if it will be as cherished as Pixar's finest efforts. An amusing mixture of ordinary direction, mediocre screenplay, uneven pacing, underdeveloped characters, apt voice performances, stupendous photography, astounding animation, appropriate score & slapstick humour, The Good Dinosaur may not live up to its high expectations but it isn't entirely devoid of the usual Pixar charm and is still capable of putting a smile across many faces, if not all.","

The basic concept is bizarre, to say the least - intelligent dinosaur adopts/befriends unintelligent boy, they share several stone age experiences together. I didn't get the point of flipping the script and making the dinosaur smarter than the human, I just didn't get that. There are some moments in the movie that would be animated magic if it was in the context of a better whole. It is almost as if they came up with the ideas for some magic moments and then tried (unsuccessfully) to build a movie around it. I need a little more than that even in an animated feature, so I would have to recommend you pass on this. Not as bad as Minions but not worth $20.","

They could have switched out dino's with people and the kid with a dog and it would equate to the same old story that has been told over and over again. Then it was just sooooo slooooow. Nothing happened. plot was as simple as it gets. The places where pixar wanted you to get your feels on, i just didn't care. The characters were so vanilla that it just didn't move me. I'm just upset with Pixar. Its really not a kids movie and it shows. When they advertised it, you would think its a family fun romp with a dino and a kid. Not at all. I was going to take my 3 year old to see it but i'm glad i went to see it first.Well rant off. Summery, plot was nothing new, characters weren't developed, and was too boring.

The metaphor of the storm is one that I think can write a resonate with people of all ages. I think that the storm can chase us follow us, or we can embrace that and run into it with arms open as Hamilton said in the eye of the hurricane, there is quiet, and sometimes we can come out of the storm, a stronger person, then when we were thrust into it against our will .","

This is also the first time that they've released two films in the same year. This and Inside Out (which was by far the better film). As far as the film itself goes, I don't think it's that bad. First off, the animation is beautiful. There's a lot of scenes where it looks like they just filmed this because that's how good it is. As far as the story goes, it's really nothing special. It's pretty predictable. I swear, I could tell exactly what was going to happen as soon as Arlo (Raymond Ochoa) and Henry (Jeffrey Wright) left into the mountains. It's heavily recycled from The Lion King. There are certainly parts I liked so I recommend it for that aspect. But as far as story goes, it's really nothing special. It's nothing bad, it's just nothing I haven't seen before.","

"saketkt","31 December 2015","The title of the movie is misleading. It should have been either the little dinosaur or simply the adventures of little Dino. To justify the title, good has to be contrasted with bad, but the movie does so only for a fraction of time out of necessity. My expectations soared when I saw Pixar as the head animation studio. Pixar has produced some great movies over the years.But, It was strange to see dinosaurs act in humanly manner, such as farming. Why did the writers do that? What were they thinking? Anyway, there is a Dino family which has three kids. One of them is fragile, and always scared. The movie is about this little one who overcomes his fear. Lacking physical capabilities, he is bullied by his brothers. He is also not a good farmer. An accident befalls the family. The father drowns and dies while chasing after a human kid, who steals and spoils their harvest for winter ahead. The family is saddened, and harsh time is upon them. The scared Dino, being depressed, is a victim of another accident while chasing after the kid. The Dino is separated from his family after the accident.The Dino blames the kid for his father's death. But they soon develop a relationship, and the kid helps the Dino survive. Their journey is an adventure in which the scared Dino overcomes his fear, saves the human kid from other evil dinosaurs, and tries to find his way back home. He also helped the kid find a human family. And finally happy reunion with his family.The plot is clichéd. The pace is slow. Dialogs were OK. But animation is good. There were a few good moments in the movie, such as the connection between the Dino and the kid, the Dino saving the kid despite being scared. I, being a grown up, was not able to connect much with the movie. It was burdensome to get through. May be the age of target audience was supposed to be low. But, I can't still fathom dinos farming.I recommend- if you have nothing to watch, go for it.","

"nicolajdavies","27 March 2021","My husband and I just watched this knowing nothing about it beforehand, and found it to be a genuinely ""nice"" film. The animation is gorgeous and pushes Pixar's incredible capabilities even further. The dinosaur seemed to be a deliberate contrast to the realistic scenery, to remind us we were watching an animation. The theme is gentle and takes me back to the innocent Disney of my childhood. There are some obvious similarities to other Disney films in there, but this didn't stop us enjoying watching it. I like how they flipped it so the dinosaur was the 'human' role and the human took on a different role too. There are some real talking points and genuine messages for children, and all of us, about love, friendship, kindness and overcoming your fears, and they are put across with emotion. There are darker scenes but they're no scarier than some in Dumbo that scared me as a child (but not enough to not want to watch Dumbo again). Almost all Disney films have darker, scarier parts, and overcoming them is part of the story journey. Those people panning this hysterically overreacting because nature isn't all ice cream and cotton candy. They need to unwrap that cotton wool from around their children and stop turning them into little snowflakes. (These are the same parents who, I imagine, won't let their kid pick up a sweet they dropped and eat it anyway because ""germs""😱).A nice, innocent, touching film, which I couldn't say about the over-the-top-ness of Inside Out.","

"jaysanchu07","5 July 2022","Although The Good Dinosaur features a simple storyline that wont blow you away, it remains endearing and heartfelt, with messages that will surely resonate with its target audience. As we follow Arlo's self discovery through grit and grind adventures with his new pal, Spot, there is a lot of excitement in every rough and tumble. There is also a great deal of laughter in each new character they cross paths with, with a trippy moment to boot ;).This film, has as well, the most beautiful landscapes ever seen from a Pixar film, hands down. From lush forests, flowing rivers & serene sunsets, each was photorealistic and each was a visual attraction. Pixar kept its characters cartoonish however, and that contrast was a wise move which absolutely worked.Sure, naysayers used to Pixar's imaginative storylines will have negatives to say for TGD, however, I find the family friendly plot has its charms and is well told. With likable characters (Spot, you are brilliant!) and fantastic backgrounds for an adventure-fueled film, there is definitely enough good here.","

It was a long time ago I burst into tears that many times watching and enjoying a animated movie. Being personal, I can relate myself to lack of family in the sense of a functional one. Therefore, this movie and story struck me like lightning into my heart and soul... wonderful and heartbreaking.To the picture itself. The animation is plain and simple marvellous! The describing of nature is simple genius and fantastic! Some times I really thought they had taken some authentic photographs and blended into the movie....that says a great deal.The story starts out to be kind of ordinary; little child in a strong family feeling discouraged and being in the wrong place. Then something happens and it takes a another direction. On the way though the story many things happens, and there is laughter, sadness, anger and other different emotions coming to live in this one.The production and the whole picture in its entirely, it is good...more than good. It has a little bit to go to really fire off into the ""great ones"".... and it is even so a good and solid movie. Some thins feels that ""Oh....this they could have taken a little bit further... a little bit better..."".Have to write this also; the little boy.... so fantastic and sooooo cute. Can I have you? ;)7,2 out of 10","

"vinodemails","14 January 2016","The opening scene of the Disney+Pixar movie, promises a wonderful perspective. What if Dinosaurs hadn't been wiped off from the planet 65 million years ago? Apparently they would grow brains and evolve into farmers / shepherds. And humans? Well, they are a young species and would take their sweet time to evolve. Great buildup, washed down the drain.The plot revolves around an Apatosaurus farming family, it's youngest kid Arlo and a caveboy who gets his name as 'spot' through an innovative guessing game. The general theme of an accidental adventure, changing the main character's life and perspectives, stays. The famed studios have over the past decade rolled over several wonderful pieces of art since the Toy Story series, through Finding Nemo to Wall-E and even last year's Inside Out, appealing to a wide age span including an entire generation, who decided to stick to their childhood animation fantasies. However, for this movie, the makers seem to have lowered the average age of their audience by much. As a kid, almost all the animation characters, whichever animal they maybe, seemed humané and we could easily associate with them like we do to our family members. So, watching Lion King, we could easily imagine Mufasa as our dad belting out instructions on life and our own wicked thoughts reflecting simba's attempt to be brake rules and be brave. It's thus easy for the kid to imagine and relate to a farming dino family showcased here. But a new gen smart kid may not accept the archaic methods of imparting age-old morals. Most of these kids want to quickly make mistakes, learn from them and move on to the next. They also seem to catch on more to the quirky and bold, rather than the straight and cautious. Arlo's character feels passé, while Spot's and even the storm chaser Thunder clap's (as the Nyctosaurus, winged dinosaur) actions are more relatable and kool. The last ditch attempt should have been tugging the right emotions, to truly connect with the hero. Disney, inspite of mastering this art for decades is lost here. Also, the title itself, emphasizing on the 'good' part, makes the audience long for the 'bad'. Not too long ago, Pixar and Disney had made 'Brave' which saw a reckless princess Melida transform into a Queen through her circumstances. The Good Dinosaur feels like a bad step backward in story telling for the studios which had earlier raised expectations to the zenith.A few good points though are the touch of old school animation (Arlo looks like a 90s kid first drawing of a dinosaur), the beautiful landscapes, the color used for bringing the river to life and lastly the voice of Sam Elliott as Butch, the rex.","

"ClaytonDavis","25 November 2015","Pixar offers another base hit for its already stunning performance as a well-oiled studio with Peter Sohn's ""The Good Dinosaur."" Standing tall as one of the Pixar's most beautiful creations to date. A lusciously crafted piece that stands as another key example of cinematography executed brilliantly in animated features. While the story hawks too much back to past Disney films like ""The Lion King,"" there's no denying the emotional and cautiously executed impact the story and its characters possess. It also assembles an impressive cast of voice work that should surprise no one as each one excels in their own way.""The Good Dinosaur"" tells the story of Arlo, an Apatosaurus who makes a perilous journey back to his family, while meeting an unlikely human friend named Spot.Young Raymond Ochoa, who voices Arlo helms the picture with gifted innocence and a palpable feeling of growth. Arlo, who's small, fearful, and unconfident is visually seen growing and maturing before our eyes. Ochoa nails every nuance and emotion required of him. Around him, Jeffrey Wright and Frances McDormand, who voice Momma and Poppa fearlessly engage with the very mature subject matter. As one of Pixar's most ""adult""-like themed movies to date, there is still a sense of naïvety as the parent dinosaurs attempt to teach life lessons. The rest of the cast is littered with the works of Steve Zahn, Anna Paquin, Sam Elliot, and more, all culminating in a smorgasbord of raw talent.From top to bottom, ""The Good Dinosaur"" soars on its visual elegance. Using the backdrop of real nature camera work, the two worlds are blended in a most fascinating way. You never feel as if the animated dinosaur and human are plucked into the scenery unwillingly or awkwardly. It works in every frame. Also worth noting is the another vivacious musical score by Academy Award winner Mychael Danna and his younger brother Jeff Danna. The two come together for a swelling of tears and suspense, all littered throughout the Pixar treat.With all the positive vibes and words that ""The Good Dinosaur"" inhabits, the story structure and baseline for our main character doesn't fall into Pixar's most original database. Essentially ""The Lion King"" for dinosaurs, the film takes queues from many animated tales seen before, and while those aren't exactly poor representations, you are very much aware of its predecessors. There are also two or so dead spots, where the film feels like it hits a brick wall. Possibly suffers from lingering too long on a moment or not exactly going places well enough, its apparent by the middle of its highly publicized troubles before release.All in all, ""The Good Dinosaur"" works. On an emotional level, I felt it hit better than ""Inside Out,"" but in terms of innovation and originality, it come up a little short. Great for kids and adults like always, Pixar does its job and does it with satisfaction.""The Good Dinosaur"" opens on Thanksgiving.","

"chappywatched","3 February 2016","Before seeing this movie, I had heard that it was going to be the first box office loss for Pixar, at least from an Australian point of view, that might have been in part because before the movie was released, I didn't see a trailer on TV for the movie until after it's release and even then it was only once or twice.I loved this movie. Was it Pixar's best? No but it definitely isn't their worst!It's your typical Pixar film; has the laughs, the feels, the action, the drama and the tears (and boy were there tears!). Also in typical Pixar fashion, the detail in things like the dinosaur scales, hair and everything else is amazing.The story was awesome with a brilliant concept, the voice work was spot on and the animation was colourful and beautiful.If you are a fan of Pixar's previous works, you should give it a watch despite what you might have heard. This will definitely be something I purchase and watch again.CHAPPY THINKS you shouldn't listen to those negative reviews, this movie is no Tyrannosaurus wreck!","

"dan-804-672327","24 January 2016","We just took our 6 yo to see the Disney PG animation movie ""The Good Dinosaurs"" which turned out to be a horrible miss. Kids were horrified and crying until about 45 mind into it when we left like others. Basically, the movie features lots of gratuitous violence like dinosaurs eating other creatures alive, parents killed by random events, kids hallucinating on toxic fruits, and a ton of mediocre meaningless plot twists that make the story look like an episode of ""The Wire"" played in dinosaur costumes. Give me my money back and especially give my little girl her innocence back. She said that she would invent a better ending than the one the movie probably had and eventually get a job at Disney with it so she can tell them they are bad story tellers and she was the little girl crying in the theatre's entrance!","

"raulfaust","31 January 2016","I can't remember the last time I went to the cinema to see an animation, but something about ""The Good Dinosaur"" really caught my attention; maybe it's due to the fact that, as a child, I've been a fan of them dinosaurs. Well, I thought I was going to see a lion king version with a different animal-- and for a moment, mainly after the father's death, I thought I really was--, but the story doesn't turn that way. It's much more of a story filled with beautiful messages, showing to our kids that we can share our lives with different people. With different races. Also, the story is able to bring some funny moments with the flaws that main character has; however, the great aspect of it is that filmmakers tried to show that things only change if we do something about it. The poor dino only learned to do things himself because he wanted to; he put a lot of effort into it. And that's a good thing to be shown to kids. Life isn't a marvelous place in which things go just like we want, and it's good that it's being said to those who will, someday, have to do things themselves. That being said, I must say I didn't regret watching it in the movies, and I recommend it to every kind of public, especially if kids are involved.","

"klare28","28 November 2015","Overall pretty lame movie. Predictable story like we've seen a million times before. The title is not even accurate. It's not like the other dinosaurs in the movie weren't good. If anything I would have called it the ""different"" dinosaur. Not sure what age group this was going for. The posters seemed to target younger kids, but some of the scenes were actually pretty scary, as in surprise/shock effect kind of scary and some were borderline brutal. Lots of kids (and some adults) jumped out of their seats. Not sure if that was because we watched in 3D. As others mentioned, animations were flawless but that's not what the movie is about. The kids enjoyed it enough, but from an adult perspective, it's not worth seeing. In my view this movie was one of the weakest Pixar productions.","

"makuribu","21 February 2016","The computer generated scenery is gorgeous. Colours, clouds, textures, all stunning. And then laid over it are creatures rendered by kids in the fourth grade who like dinosaurs. Why? Why would you do something so jarring? Manipulative, plot-less, meandering, trite, cliché ridden cinematic junkfood. My kids were predicting the plot within minutes of the start of the film. ""His Dad's going to die."" There are too many inconsistencies to enumerate, and too many glaring impossibilities in the concept of talking agrarian dinosaurs who would have evolved if only the comet hadn't hit. But why does every dinosaur have to have an accent like a 1950s southern US dirt farmer? Is it the Disney management or just the inevitable decline of organizations that makes Pixar bereft of ideas and able only to come up with vacuous stuff like this, and Inside Out?","

"Jennifer-edwards1","15 December 2015","Pixar did their job with the animation, but the storyline is so far beneath Disney that they should be ashamed and embarrassed to attach their name to it. They have toys representing the characters already in the Disney stores, but nobody who has seen the show would want the reminder of it. The PG rating puzzled me at first, but it's deserved, in my opinion, for mean-spirited eating of live creatures, humor situated around peeing, depictions of joy in hallucinating after eating red berries, and unnecessarily intense drama and emotion throughout. There is no musical score to speak of and a very narrow, if any, market for this hideous movie, unsuitable for all ages.","

"LiveLoveLead","5 July 2016","Someone brought up on a message board thread about ""Why Parents Don't Like This Movie"" and also stressed that parents are too overprotective with their kids (I don't think this poster was a parent themselves) Well, as a parent of 2 birth kids and one foster child I'll tell you why SOME parents MAY not like this movie... Although the world can be a tough place, and parents need to prepare their kids for real life conflicts, I don't think parents take their kids to a ""family film"" expecting to see nothing but tragedy, danger and threats portrayed for nearly the entire movie. Some kids will have no problem with this film, they will laugh through most of it, but sensitive kids may get a bit distressed over certain parts of the film. It's not like we haven't seen cartoons that have parents die or innocent animals killed before, but this film just isn't up to par with those films in general.(I'm never scared of having tough and honest conversations with my kids, but there is a big difference explaining things to a 3-year-old vs a 5-year-old vs a 10-year-old, etc. Wise parents chose the right time to address certain issues with their children and it doesn't always have to do with their age, but often more about their sensitivity and maturity levels...I digress)Most parents take their kids to the movies to be entertained, and if you are lucky you may get a well portrayed moral or value you can talk over. Besides the fact that this movie had a lot of violence, sadness, anger, fear and anxiety (which might be a bit too heavy-handed for the very young child,) this movie needs A LOT of explaining, including having to explain things that I just don't agree with.I wasn't thrilled with the whole idea of the kid dinosaurs having to do something ""good enough"" to ""earn their mark."" It makes it seem as if a child has to do some big, special thing that is considered worthy before they are completely accepted by their own family, instead of just being loved for who they are. Arlo wasn't considered equal or up- to-par until he overcame his fears... but what if you have a child prone to anxiety or fear? Are they not good enough? Does that make them less lovable or accepted by their family? If you aren't brave, or are of a more sensitive nature, does that mean your a bad person or something is wrong with you? This message was very confusing and off putting. As a foster parent the part about the other caveman-family welcoming Spot (the human boy) the into their family was heart-warming, but at the same time, many foster kids never become part of a family and live in group homes their whole lives, so as much as that part touched my heart I could also see it bringing heart-break to a foster/displaced child as well. Also, there are all kinds of ""homes"" for kids, so Spot being adopted by Arlo's family (the dinosaurs) might have been just as meaningful... showing that you don't have to be exactly alike to accept and love each other... just a thought.Personally, I just thought the movie OK. It had some very touching parts and some humor, a lesson on bravery and friendship and extending kindness to others, and all that was nice, but there were also a lot of parts that were silly, boring and out of place. I never liked the ""drunk"" scene in Dumbo and didn't like it here either. For me it just was not as enjoyable or well done as many others like: Toy Story, Incredibles, Up, Monsters Inc. and Inside Out (which I loved, but think is a bit complex for young kids) Anyway, that is my Humble Opinion... take it or leave it ;)","

"rgkarim","28 November 2015","What if Dinosaurs never died out? This question continues to plague minds to this very day of a world where the gigantic lizards reigned. Fortunately Disney/Pixar have decided to take a crack at answering this with another culmination of their animation studios. Today's review is on the Good Dinosaur. With all the advertisements, Disney certainly has faith in this film not only in their overzealous trailers, but also making it in 3-D much like their last movie (Inside Out). Does Pixar strike gold, or is it only fool's gold being sent to the masses? As always, read on to find out. The Positives: 1. The Animation: No surprise that Pixar continues to push boundaries of computer animation. Once more the team has crafted characters that not only move as expected of their anatomy, but also integrate human like qualities to them that represent the western theme of the movie. Watching the Apatosaurus family farm the land or seeing the T-rex galloping as if they were on horses, added that spunk Pixar is always known for. Even more impressive for this reviewer was the scenery. Whether it was designing a forest strewn with bugs or unleashing the ferocity of storm upon the prairie plans, Pixar captures the details in extraordinary definition that it is difficult to determine if it is real footage. 2. The Emotions: Recently Pixar has missed the mark in eliciting any real emotional response in me, but in the Good Dinosaur that is not the case. Disney tries their usual tactics to get you to cry, but those overdramatic moments are old hat to me. However, this movie uses the animation and a killer soundtrack to craft a number of scenes that radiate the feelings of our characters. I felt myself feeling the excitement as our characters ran through the plains, felt the fear of being caught in situations that pushed your limits, and mostly the love between friends. So many emotions ran through me as I watched these two grow scene by scene. Those with strong bonds to their pets will fully appreciate what Spot and Arlo have, overlaying their experiences into the movie, perhaps to the point of shedding a tear. 3. The Cuteness/Laughs: Pixar keeps the cuteness rolling in this movie not only in the design of the characters, but in their countless antics. If their design doesn't get you, then the relationship between Spot and Arlo will certainly melt your heart. As for comedy, little kids were screaming in delight throughout the movie, primarily at Spot biting Arlo. Eventually the tactics got old for me, but the more clever jokes kept me chuckling throughout the movie, especially from Forrest Woodbush whose craziness was well timed. The Negatives:1. Formulaic/Predictable: No surprise here The Good Dinosaur is not the most original tale. Disney's throws out the usual tactics to establish our character's background and get the story rolling. Some of you may cry, others may be like me and laugh at the illogical elements in this tale. Even after the cliché opening, the tale doesn't throw many surprises at you as Arlo and Spot go through the typical character building elements we've seen time and again. This normally isn't too bad when it comes to Pixar movies, but in this film it left me bored at parts. Pixar has smoothed out their more aggressive edges in this film to make it more kid friendly. 2. Loose ends: The point of this movie is obviously a character building one centered on Arlo, but that doesn't mean we get sloppy on other plot elements. In this film there are a couple of elements left untied that were a bit annoying. A few of the characters were in the film for mere minutes before disappearing from the story. Family, side characters, even villains vanish hastily in an all too convenient manner that was a little sloppy for Pixar's team. Even the ends they did tie up felt a bit rushed and again illogical if you've seen other movies (I guess evolution didn't favor them in this case.) Fortunately the emotional aspect of this movie makes up for the lacking plot, but not the best for Pixar. 3. Scary to Kids: This factor all depends on the kids, as well as the parents, but I want to warn parents about the scarier aspects of the movie. Unlike other Pixar creations, this one is not afraid to dive into the darker elements of story telling. Those with a fear of thunder and lightning may end up wailing through the movie providing a grand distraction that is very irritating.. The high definition surround sound amplifies the sounds further, and the dinosaurs fierce roars were able to shake the younger audiences. Plus there are a few moments that were a little more adult as well, so caution has been advised. The Good Dinosaur is certainly a cute addition to Pixar's library. The adorable characters and heartfelt relationship are certainly the strongest elements of this movie and the animation further amplifies the emotions of this movie. Unfortunately it isn't their most entertaining tale lacking some of the fun surprises and elements that we love in their creations. Therefore I can't say this one is worth the trip to the theater (especially in 3-D) and would recommend a home rent for this installment. My scores are: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0","

"cnycitylady","5 May 2017","Disney Pixar's ""The Good Dinosaur"" misses nearly every mark it attempts to hit. It just tries too hard to tug at your heartstrings and falls into the trap of telling and not showing. It spends the first forty minutes telling you just how poor little Arlo struggles with life, telling us that he needs our sympathy instead of letting us reach that conclusion on our own. The film also didn't quite seem to know where to take the story; adding unnecessary deaths and random villainous characters to motivate our hero who doesn't seem to be motivated to do much of anything. The story could have worked just as well, perhaps even better without the entire premise of humans and dinosaurs living side be side. It cheapened the tale to a knock off of a much superior film you might know called ""Ice Age."" Disney is known for its heartwarming and honest tales of self discovery that help to shape the children who see them, but this one will certainly be categorized as a miss and forgotten shortly hereafter.The movie does have its entertaining moments, particularly with the wrangling cowboy Tyrannosauruses, but overall this film can be passed over without your having missed much. 6/10","

"maria-potter","28 December 2015","I went to watch it expecting to find it childish, or perhaps a little predictable, but it was far worse than I could imagine. Not suitable for kids, and absolutely terrible for adults. It practically is a very, VERY bad imitation of The Lion King, along with a bit from Brother Bear, Ice Age, A Bug's Life etc., but completely lacking the heart and meaning of any of these movies. The movie doesn't even explore the implications of dinosaurs existing along with humans, to the point where it made me wonder why they didn't just pick some random animals to tell their story and let go of the whole alternate reality of dinosaurs and humans co-existing altogether.There isn't really much of a plot to begin with. It's a road trip kind of movie (like most recent Disney and Pixar movies), during which Arlo, a young dinosaur, meets a human child with whom they become unlikely friends (surprise surprise), and many random characters along the way, who do very little to move the story forward. There is too much unnecessary violence, as well as a very weird drug scene, neither of which seem to serve the (limited) plot in any way. In addition to all that, the film isn't that visually beautiful either: the backgrounds are extremely detailed, whereas the dinosaurs look very cartoony and out of place.Almost every scene of it felt familiar, from the human boy stealing the dinosaurs' food and them going after it, resulting to Arlo's father's death (Brother Bear), to Arlo and his father having 'meaningful' conversations about bravery under the, well, fireflies (The Lion King), to the supposedly bittersweet moment in which Arlo lets the little boy stay with the other humans (The Jungle Book/Ice Age). The Lion King kind of moments in particular where countless; Arlo even roars at some point, to little effect, until he manages to do it properly towards the end of the movie, for heaven's sake! Also, for some reason I do not seem to comprehend, the human boy was behaving, not like a human or an ape, but more like a dog, much like Maximus in Tangled and Sven in Frozen.All in all, don't watch this movie. Stay home and re-watch the Lion King; it has so much more to offer, even if you're watching it for the millionth time.","

"richet-15259","28 November 2015","Although this movie did have some great parts and a strong overall message, you will have to sit through 90 minutes of one anxious, overly harsh, morbid, stormy or unpleasant scene after another. There were not enough characters to enlighten us from time to time, even if just for a moment. People keep using the word scary, but I prefer to describe differently. Remember that feeling you had while watching James Franco in 127 hours or Sandra Bullock in Gravity or even Tom Hanks in cast away? That feeling where you start hoping that something good will finally happen? But it never does? Well this is your kid version of it! There were a couple of lighter scenes that were actually quite powerful but not enough for my taste. I though it was a bit too much, even for older kids, (and I'm not sensitive or easily offended at all.) Worth a watch maybe once you can see it at home and not feel bad about walking out or having your children be frightened by too many intense scenes that leave them feeling really sad and helpless.","

I believed that Dreamworks made animals more beautiful than Pixar, but after watching this movie, I have to change my opinion. The animation is stupendous, I don't remember the last time I saw animation this wonderful. The water, the trees, the child, they all seemed REAL. The story is better than many meaningless plots that animation movies have nowadays (ex- Minions). Its beautiful, meaningful and it did make me cry at several parts. The music (OSCAR WINNER Mychael Danna from LIFE OF PI)and the voice acting are superb. Yes, this movie might be disliked by kids, because the level of violence is a tad above other animation movies. This movie feels a little bit serious when its telling you something. Everything is not supposed to be a joke. The maturity level of this movie is a tad high over others. And that's actually great, IMO. Animation is for everyone.All in all, Pixar has surprised me. This is a wonderful animated movie. Its an unforgettable experience. Should be watched by all. Watch it, and then form your opinion. Don't MISS IT BY READING THE BAD REVIEWS. I was going to miss it, after reading the reviews. I am so lucky I didn't. Believe me, it's worth it.","

However, for anyone over that age (and yes, most 9 year olds will probably even think this is a bit stupid), it's a excessively simplified affair, with an extremely plain story, a lack of great humour or strong emotion, or anything that would mark this as a film by Pixar, the studio that has made so many iconic animated films that absolutely anyone can enjoy.Before we get into why this film is a bit of a disappointment, however, I have to say that it is, and is meant to be, a movie for young kids. This isn't like the emotionally deep and compelling classics like Finding Nemo, Up and Inside Out, it's just a textbook adventure story, with a nice, fun character at the centre, so it will entertain the kids.However, that's all that you can really say to defend this film, because it really is nowhere near that high standards that we know Pixar are capable of, and that's why it can't hide behind the defence of being 'just a kids' movie'.The main issue, by a country mile, is how simple the story is. There is no real sense of genuine peril for our heroes as they travel far across the land, and nor is there any interesting insight into this world where dinosaurs still roam, after they weren't made extinct by the asteroid.Instead, the film takes the premise in a very dull direction, and personifies the dinosaurs way too much, making it no different to any movie about humans. Although Pixar have done that with other animals in films such as Finding Nemo, they at least provided a different take on the world through the eyes of those animals, which provided for some good comedy and a bit more interest, whereas the world of these dinosaurs is nothing different.Also, the film lacks an emotional power to it that could have saved it from being so dull. Again, it's targeted more at younger kids, but it still clearly tries hard to tug at your heartstrings, but I felt so completely removed from any sense of emotion in the film, making it even more dull to watch. And when you then couple that with the fact that this isn't really that funny (not even the kids were laughing out loud at some of the jokes), this becomes a much more disappointing film to watch.Finally, let's talk about the animation. Normally with Pixar, it's a foregone conclusion, but this time round, it's not. The scenic backgrounds are all absolutely gorgeous, and look as close to real life as you can get with animation, but the design of the dinosaurs as these more cartoonish things makes them stick out like a sore thumb, and it's just another detail that removes you further from getting into the story.Overall, The Good Dinosaur is a film that young kids will find enjoyment in, but its lack of emotion and an interesting story make this so much more generic than what we know Pixar can do.","

"mi-71622","2 December 2015","I'll keep this simple with no spoilers.The good: Amazing animation. The environments are incredibly realistic. Surprisingly the characters are probably the ""worst"" animation in the film, but still good. This is the only reason for 3 stars.The bad: SLOW. Drawn out boredom punctuated by moments of pretty scary intensity. (Way too intense for young kids, in my opinion.) Very little dialogue. Very few moments of levity. Very little character development. Characters aren't really likable or relatable.The ugly: Several instances of scary and violent dialogue and very scary situations. I understand were talking about dinosaurs, who were the apex predators of their day, and that they supposedly lived in a brutal environment, but this is supposed to be a kids movie!Summary: My wife and I took our boys (9 and 4) to see this. We were sorry we did so. My 4 year old sat still as a stone, very unusual for him, and the look on his face alternated between fear and boredom for most of the film. I actually considered taking him out of the theater a couple times. My 9 year old did not laugh once during the movie, also unusual, and told me as we were walking out he thought the movie ""was just okay."" Sorry to say I can't recommend this as a family movie.","

"li-wang-eecs","26 November 2015","1. This is not a Pixar movie. What is that Indian shot film in the begging of the movie mean any way? I almost though they played the wrong tape, and what is that Thank you letter for? It is only good if this was a good movie but it is not, which makes that thank you letter looks like a beggar. 2. The kid is a totally screw up who can't do anything right. He killed his dad they he blame on the little one. He can't even take a fight on it and fell in the river and for some reason he survived and made friends with the little kid and went back home, end of the story. The transition of the story line is not there, there is no soul of this movie. 3. The only up side of this movie is the amazing graphics, one of the best I even seen in years but is that worth 15$ and 2 hours to watch? My answer is no. I rather spend that 15$ as gas money, and enjoy some state parks for 2 hours. 4. Steve is rolling in his grave...","

"FairlyAnonymous","12 December 2015","The Good Dinosaur is not a perfect movie. (Except for the animation, which is years ahead of its time and is photo-realistic)Don't get me wrong. There are issues in its plot (mostly the very beginning and the VERY VERY end), but it is also a very good movie in many respects.Now, first things first, a lot of people seem to give this movie a low-rating for being ""too-violent-for-kids"". Well, get over it. If you're kids don't like it, that doesn't make it a bad movie. What is even more interesting is that this movie IS ABOUT GETTING OVER YOUR FEARS!!! To not make this movie violent and scary would be to take out the entire premise of the film. Arlo NEEDS to be scared. He NEEDS to face real and threatening dangers. This movie is all about nature, survival, and fear. This is an essential and necessary moment.Now, to get into the movie itself. The Good Dinosaur is a movie about a dinosaur named Arlo who is weak and the runt of his family. He constantly scared and frightened of everything and is bad at doing his job. Eventually, he is separated by his family by falling into a river and he needs to find his way back home. That is the basic premise.What makes this movie work isn't the premise, but it is the execution. When I first heard of this movie years ago I was unconvinced. When I first saw the trailers I was unconvinced. When my fellow animators told me it was good I was unconvinced. WHEN I SAW THE FIRST TEN MINUTES I WAS UNCONVINCED. It wasn't until about half-way through the movie I thought ""Wow, this is actually really good"". And I think the reason why it is so good is because it has a character we sympathize, and it has likable characters.This brings us back to violence. The movie is about Arlo finding strength to make it through pain. For this to happen, this means that Arlo needs to feed pain... and he feels A LOT of pain. I'm not joking, the amount of injuries Arlo sustains is tremendous (for an animated movie) and the movie doesn't shy away from making them painful. Every injury he sustains has weight and impact. When he falls over and hits his head on a rock, it feels painful. It doesn't feel cartoony. Seeing Arlo going through so much pain immediately makes him a character we can sympathize. At first, I didn't care so much for him, but as soon as he started getting beat up I realized that I cared for this kid. I wanted him to make it.This brings us to our second character, Spot. Again, on paper, a boy and his dinosaur being reversed to a dinosaur and his boy doesn't sound very interesting. What, you just reversed the roles? So what. HOWEVER, The Good Dinosaur actually pulls it off. This is because Spot isn't just a dog. He is very much a kid and something unlike a dog... but he still acts like a dog at times. Much like in The Croods, Spot is a ball of power and fury. In the movie, Spot is lightning in a bottle, waiting to pounce, attack, or act in any situation. This makes him an interesting compliment for Arlo, who is timid, scared, quiet, meek, but huge.The two compliment each other very well and their relationship is good. The best moments of the movie are when Spot shows emotion beyond his pure aggression. This happens rarely, but when it happens, it has impact.The other characters in the movie are great. The T-Rex cowboys are hilarious, the raptors and pterodactyls were creepy, and all other characters had a nice balance between likable yet strange.Now, there is one glaring issue with the film and that is the beginning and the very very end. The movie has this theme where Arlo needs to ""prove himself"" to his family by making his ""mark"" by accomplishing something great. Now, this is an interesting concept as longs as Arlo learns that leaving his mark isn't important. He doesn't need a ""medal"" to be confident in himself. However, the movie never directly tells the audience that this kind of thinking is a little skewed. There are subtle hints throughout the movie that the ""mark"" isn't really important, but I don't think the movie made it clear enough that Arlo had grown past that stage of thinking.All in all, The Good Dinosaur is a beautiful story with beautiful animation. The plot does have some issues, but it is smarter than it lets on and it does have a lot of heart. However, this movie IS NOT for everyone. If your kids are easily scared, then don't watch it. That is not a fault in the movie, that is just your kids not being ready. Also, this movie isn't packed full of jokes and action. It is a quieter film that focuses much more on atmosphere and emotions. I would compare this movie to a ""frontier"" film, where everything has that ""cowboy/ranch/western"" type of feel. It is very subtle in pacing and action.This is not for everyone, but that doesn't make it a bad film.","

"tavm","14 December 2015","This Disney/Pixar feature is about a young dinosaur boy facing his fears and making a new friend, a human boy who he names Spot, in his traveling back to his home after being lost from being put out in the river during a storm. Slow-going at first, it picks up when these two go on their adventures together and encountering many adults-both friendly and fearsome-along the way. The music-sounding bluegrass in many scenes of beautiful nature scenery-is some of the most wonderful to hear in an animated movie of the computer kind. My movie theatre-working friend and I really enjoyed this. So on that note, we both highly recommend The Good Dinosaur.","

"HaveWisdomWillTravel","3 January 2016","I have adolescent nephews and nieces, but no kids to drag me into every Pixar flix or 3D cartoon on offer so I won't call myself a 3D animation connoisseur. I watch it as a random walk-in one Saturday as a couple, with some other young as well as middle age couples, and of course some families, in a new theater in the city.Everyone laughed a lot. The kids laughed at certain things a lot louder than the adults. But people are definitely moved and entertained. I laughed plenty, so did my other half who didn't expect to. I admit I also teared at touching and beautiful bits too...I really really really LOVE the two lead characters. Especially the so so adorable and very fierce and ""bite-ty"" little wolf boy Spot. Visually and musically it is just stunning - the opening scene of the expansive green vista and corn field are and the flowing water, river rocks and pine forest are just so...wow. Soon it doesn't matter it's a CG world, I could smell the delightful crisp fresh mountain dew air. That alone should keep the most jaded adults occupied...I reckon anyway...As a narrative it is emotive and true. The overall theme is about lost young one overcoming fear and blame, cultivating self-care and becoming own authority. More subtly, it is also about overcoming lower nature of vengeful impulse, ethnocentric-ism and xenophobia. The overall narrative tone is un-sappy, non-preachy, unforced, even warm, fun, heartening, and...just adorable.For parents with young kids: there are a few potentially ""scary"" scenes of animals being swallowed (eaten) alive in cartoony manners, no blood or guts, just instant. There's also Spot biting (to kill) all sorts of poisonous or yucky creature enemies, which can be yucky to some I think. Some may call the lead dinosaur's momentary hallucination astral dream scene kinda ""creepy"" too. Also a few life-threatening chase/ kidnap scenes. So perhaps no under 7 year old or easily-scared under-10's.What I love most about this production - and quite a few local viewers have aptly noted - that it is a totally independent standalone story world with no reference to any existing Disney story world or Hollywood characters. How refreshing and daring! Especially in this era of endless soulless mergers-Avengers and clever meta-narratives, a cynical time of giant studios aggressively squeezing the last drop out of their over- prized, milked-to-death back catalogs. So nice to be able to immerse in a wholistic story world again without feeling the greedy invisible hands of big studio boardroom suits.All that over-thinking analysis aside, this is a story worth experiencing simply because it is a good old fashion coming-of-age adventure story, with good characters, and lots of heart and beauty.I will recommend this movie not just to teens+, but to any adult friends, even the most jaded ones - especially the most jaded ones. Definitely a 10/10.","

"pal05052003","25 November 2015","I was expecting this to be underwhelming compared to other Pixar animations. The story was a typical journey story where the protagonist has to face challenges and meets an unlikely friend. However, this formula still works, even though it is not original. The main strengths of the movie was its visuals, and soundtrack (which blended so well you didn't notice the music). Though it is for children, it does not try to be so sweet. There are several death scenes which are quick, and serve as a quick reminder of the cruel world in the jungle. It also is refreshing to see a human uttering no speech except for grunts and howls; making the story seen from the perspective of the dinosaurs. The movie also manages to capture the beauty and cruelty of nature, although they look like copies of scenes from other movies. The drama was well-played too. In short, it is an entertaining, but not so original story.","

"dineshaishu","1 June 2019","I sat down to watch ""The Good Dinosaur"" with my family, that being wife and 6 year old son, and I didn't really have any idea that I would end up being as entertained by this animated movie as I was. I had thought that this would just be another one of those mass-produced generic animated movies aiming for the kids.The story in ""The Good Dinosaur"" was actually surprisingly good, and it was told in a very entertaining way, and also in a way that kept the movie progressing at a constant good pace. There weren't really any dull moments throughout the course of the movie, and even the slower moments in the movie were good and had crucial parts to the overall storyline.The CGI, style and textures in ""The Good Dinosaur"" were all very impressive. But of course, Pixar is well-known for that, and they didn't disappoint by any means with this 2015 release. The entire animated world was rich in color, details and very lovable.As for the characters portrayed in ""The Good Dinosaur"", well there is something for everyone here. I dare say that much. Of course you have someone brave, someone lovable, someone daring, someone clumsy, etc. etc. It was all here. And they had managed to get together and impressive group of voice actors and actresses for the various roles. And for an animated movie, then the voice acting is essential.""The Good Dinosaur"" is the kind of story that you take to heart immediately and you will be entertained right up to the very end of the movie, that is for sure. And although you already know how the movie will end, it is still a good story to experience and an entertaining movie to watch.This 2015 animated movie, like most Pixar movies, is of the type that you can watch more than just a single time. And it does stand out from many other Pixar movies, mainly because of the setting of the age of dinosaurs and the characters.""The Good Dinosaur"" scores a solid six stars out of ten rating from me, as it is a movie that has that ability to make you feel good, feel entertained and make you laugh all at the same time.","

"ashleyperison","8 December 2015","Let me begin by saying that I've never seen a Disney film I didn't like, but this was the first movie I've ever walked out on.Inside Out went viral and word spread it was a charming movie. The opposite is the case for The Good Dinosaur; word is spreading that it is an awful movie. You can't rely on stunning graphics to make a successful movie. The storyline was boring and it recycled the same plots as Land Before Time (not Disney), Finding Nemo, and The Lion King making it extremely predictable. However, unlike those three successful movies, there was very little humour, charm, or heartfelt moments present in this film. It relied heavily on action and cliffhangers. Although the moral of the story is good, ""sometimes you've gotta get through your fears to see the beauty on the other side"", it was nothing profound. Think of the message as though it was a gourmet dinner served on the lid of a trash can. Although the film is promoted as a children's' film (Its rated PG but it's advertised on the preschool Disney Jr channel), it is not a children's' movie! Forget the intense moments of the Poppa dying near the beginning Mufasa style, or the violent dinosaur fights.. The same happened in The Lion King and I expected it in this film as well. Don't be naive to think that animal violence wouldn't make an appearance in a dinosaur film. However, many of the dinosaurs in the movie are cruel and down right creepy! A gang of pterodactyls manipulate Arlo into helping their search and rescue team (which turns out to be a cult, 'the storm provides') and after Arlo saves a baby animal, the leader eats the baby alive. Really Disney? Not necessary. There is also many inappropriate drug references in this film. The obvious being when Arlo and Spot ingested some rotten berries and hallucinate. If that was the only alcohol/drug reference for the sake of humour, I could look past it (Think Dumbo's pink elephant parade, Tangled's drunk Cupid, etc). However, there are at least two more drug references that were more sneaky and clever to impress the adults in the audience (the paranoid drug induced spiritualist triceratop, the gang of meth addicted hillbilly velociraptors). Just inappropriate in my opinion and they made for a cast of unlikable, creepy dinosaurs. I guess Arlo was the Good Dinosaur because he said no to drugs...I hate it when reviewers say this movie is inappropriate for children because of the animalistic violence. Again, what did you expect? It isn't scary, it's more disturbing and unlikable. As a major Disney and Pixar fan, I am sad to say this movie is a major flop and does not live up to the standards many parents expect from these studios.","

"pranayjalvi","26 December 2015","As always expected from Pixar to create and deliver good movies to its viewers, The Good Dinosaur too stands upto its hype. However the plot was not too magnificent but it works very well for me. The story centres on Arlo, an Aptosaurus and Spot, unlikely human. The movie is debut for Director Peter Sohn who has made an equitable justice to the movie. However as compared to other movies, The good dinosaur was less creative and a bit disappointment for Pixar. Brightly coloured and magnificent animation helps the movie in creating a good surrounding to watch for children as well as Adults. Like other Pixar movies, I loved this one too and go with 4/5 for this animation from Pixar. Hope everyone likes it the way I liked it.","

Can it really be that the same company that gave us Inside Out not too long ago, the best animated movie I have ever seen, produces an utterly forgettable movie such as this? I cannot even recommend watching this on Netflix. Absolutely horrible story line, too scary for smaller kids (6 years and under), violence, and strong language (""I'll end you!""). Really? Where are the lovable side characters that make a movie enjoyable, where are the twists in the plot? There's nothing new in this movie, just a rehashing of old ideas stolen from gems like Finding Nemo. My 6-year-old daughter complained about there not being enough dinosaurs in the movie and that it wasn't very interesting. Pixar, do you hear that? A 6-year-old figured this out.Save your time and money, go buy a copy of Inside Out.","

"Thanos_Alfie","28 November 2018","""The Good Dinosaur"" is an Animation movie in which we watch a family of dinosaurs which are living side by side with humans trying to collect and store as much food as they can in order to survive in the winter. Every dinosaur of this family wants to put its sign (footprint) on the building that they store their food because in this way it will be an important part of the family. The footprint represents the importance of a dinosaur in the family.I believe that this movie is just another average animation and nothing more, it's not a bad movie but if you want to watch it just don't expect much from it. If you have already watched some of the classic animated movies then you will understand from the first minute of it what it's going to happen and how the plot is going to be. Despite that, I would like to mention that I liked the direction of Peter Sohn's because he made us see from a different perspective some situations and the most important was that even that we are watching an animated movie there was an evolution in the character of the dinosaur (Arlo).To sum up, I have to say that ""The Good Dinosaur"" is an average movie with some good scenes but a boring plot and also bad CGI's. If you are a fan of animated movies and you have already watched some others then there isn't any need for watching this movie. Although if you want to watch it then you should be prepared for it.","

"genuinejoy","29 November 2015","I was beyond disappointed with this movie. I actually checked online in the middle to make sure this was actually a Pixar film. The writing was so abhorrent that I almost got up and left in the middle. One line that I just found unbelievable was when the scar-faced dinosaur said he drowned the crocodile in a pool of his own blood! There was absolutely no comic relief and I only felt relieved when it ended. It is on par with the unedited version of Toy Story. Will think twice about going to the theater to watch another Pixar film. Don't waste your money. We went to see Inside Out at the theater and even though it had adult themes and was stressful at times, it had a deep redeeming meaning. I know that they were trying to show the bond of family and friendship but it was so lacking. If the whole script was rewritten to be funnier and less scary, then it would be worth it.","

Even in accepting a world where dinosaurs talk, and live at the same time as early human species, it still seemed odd that the Neanderthals mostly walked about on all fours, and that their sense of smell was so sensitive. And some animals are the bad guys for eating meat, but some aren't, just because. Maybe it needed some musical numbers or something. I dunno. Not bad, but not The Good Dinosaur, either.","

"kdavies-69347","10 February 2016","I saw this film last night with my girlfriend. She and I catch every Disney/Pixar animation that comes out, and I'm happy to say we both enjoy these type of films. Normally we find ourselves totally involved with their films, and we always recommend them to just about everyone we know, but last night we both left the theater and we both felt... disappointed with itThe Good Dinosaur takes a look at what the world would be like if the dinosaurs hadn't died out 65 million years ago. They evolved into these kind of cartoony googly-eyed anthropomorphic creatures, instead of, well something more realistic, while the human species have devolved into nothing more than wild dogs, unable of basic communication despite having vocal cords, cognitive brains, and the ability to build things. Anyways, the film is supposed to inspire a master and pet kind of relationship between the two of them, as a twist on our relationship with domesticated animals perhaps. The design of the characters were just so off and clash with the realism presented in the background and they really feel out of place throughout. The backgrounds however were possibly the only real part of the film that I loved. The scenery is astounding to say the least, but it makes the characters stick out like a sore thumb. They look totally out of place when you compare them with the realisism that the animators perfected for the scenery.The plot is kind of a ""Homeward Bound"" series of events, which certainly brings nothing new to children's films. It touches on some important themes, like inadequacy, loss, fear, and grief, but pales in comparison to it's predecessor ""Inside Out."" Rather, it lacks any real palpable moments of emotional content and empathy towards the main characters of the film, and to be honest it's pretty boring throughout. Even the moments of action in the movie, it lacks a sense of danger and fear that other Pixar films like ""Toy Story"" have brought to this genre in the past. Like I said before, we both felt extremely underwhelmed by the whole thing.Anyway, for those of you with children, you might have some different ideas. It is a wholesome story (except for the acid trip), but I think most kids will be bored stiff throughout. For adults who love animation, the backgrounds are stunning, but the characters and plot are flat as a pancake. Far below the expectations for most Pixar films.5/10","

"kennethmorazes","26 November 2015","After watching many fantastic looking for trailers for kids movies that looked great we were very excited to watch The Good Dinosaur. The first thing we got was a terrifying Pixar Short featuring a scary dark monster battling 3 super hero's and a small boy. Already my 6 year old son was terrified but i figured he would come around once the movie started. After a slow but tame beginning we were brought to a graphic death scene which didn't come as too much of a surprise as there is always something like this to begin the quest for the main character. From there, scattered between some brief lighthearted bits with a few mild laughs, were many death defying encounters with horrible monster dinosaurs looking to eat or kill the good dinosaur and his companion. After about an hour of tears and covered eyes we finally decided it wasn't worth it and left. As soon as we did the tears became out right crying and fear from my usually hard to scare son. Not quite sure what Pixar was hoping to accomplish with this film.","

"jboothmillard","5 October 2020","I kept seeing images for this computer animation from Disney/Pixar, I never saw a trailer or read about it, so I didn't know what to expect, but it was rated very well, I was definitely up for it. Basically, 65 million years ago, in an alternative history, the asteroid that was supposed to collide with the Earth, causing the extinction of the dinosaurs, safely passes the planet. Millions of years later, dinosaurs are the dominant species, and the human race never evolved beyond cavemen. On a farm in the middle of a valley, Apatosaurus corn farmers Henry (Jeffrey Wright) and Ida (Frances McDormand) have three children that hatch from their eggs, Libby (Maleah Nipay-Padilla), Buck (Ryan Teeple) and Arlo (Jack McGraw). As they grow up, the children try to ""make their mark"", to earn a mud-print on the family's corn silo. Grown up Libby and Buck (Marcus Scribner) are successful in carrying out duties and earning their ""mark"", but the timid Arlo (Raymond Ochoa) finds difficulty in farm tasks. Arlo's Poppa tries to give his son a sense of purpose by asking him to guard the silo and setting a trap for the creature stealing from it. Arlo successfully captures a caveboy (Jack Bright), but Arlo cannot bring himself to kill him, and sets him free. Henry is disappointed and takes Arlo with him to track the caveboy, heading into a ravine. Suddenly, a flash flood washes towards them, Arlo is saved, but his father is swept away and killed. Without his father, Arlo shoulders more of the workload. Looking inside the silo, he finds the same caveboy he previously trapped, angered and blaming him for his father's death, he chases him, and at the river hits his head on a stone and is knocked unconscious. Waking up, Arlo finds himself far from home, and tries to survive alone, only to trap him leg under a fallen boulder. The next day, he wakes and finds his leg has been freed, and the caveboy appears with food for him. The caveboy then leads Arlo to a berry tree, where the caveboy fights a large snake, amazing Arlo and impressing the nearby eccentric Forrest Woodbush, a Styracosaurus (Peter Sohn) who wants to keep the boy. The two dinosaurs compete with each other to give the boy a name he will respond to, and Arlo wins, giving him the name ""Spot"". Arlo and Spot bond as Arlo talks about his family, and Spot, though unable to speak, reveals that his own parents are dead. Later, a storm strikes, Arlo is frightened of the thunder and lightning and runs away, losing the riverbank he has been following home. The next morning, Arlo wakes to find Spot at his side. They are noticed by a band of pterodactyls, led by Thunderclap (Steve Zahn). They claim to be rescuing creatures but are savage carnivores. The pterodactyls attempt to attack and catch Arlo and Spot, but they are rescued by Tyrannosaurus siblings Nash (A.J. Buckley) and Ramsey (Anna Paquin) who ward off the villains. The siblings take Arlo and Spot to their father Butch (Sam Elliott), the three of them are looking for herd of longhorns. The group locates the herd, Butch gets the help of Arlo to lure four Velociraptors and rustle the cattle. During the process, Arlo sees the the familiar mountain peaks of his homeland in the distance and leaves with Spot to return home. Along the way, they see an adult feral caveman in the distance, and though Spot shows interest, Arlo dissuades him, and they keep going. As another storm approaches, Thunderclap and the pterodactyls return and attack and carry Spot away. Arlo gets tangled in a bunch of vines, where he has a vision of Henry leading him home. In the vision, Arlo stops following his father, wanting to save Spot, his father is proud and fades away. Arlo escapes the vines, he finds the pterodactyls at the corner of the river, he attacks them. Arlo and Spot together plunge Thunderclap and the pterodactyls into the water, where they are swept helplessly downstream. When another flash flood occurs, Spot falls into the water, but Arlo leaps in to rescue him before they reach a waterfall. Arlo protects Spot as they plummet down the fall and carries him to shore. As they approach Arlo's home, the two again encounter the caveman, and are approached by an entire cave family. With great reluctance, Arlo pushes Spot to join his newfound family, and the two of them share a tearful goodbye. Arlo finally arrives back home to his mother and siblings and makes his mark on the silo between those of his mother and father. This is a much more back-to-basics story, I will agree its not one of the best, but it is charming enough as you follow a dinosaur and his feral young human friend on a journey to return home, with likeable characters, a fantastic use of colour, spot on realistic scenery, and other elements that appeal to children and adults alike, it is a fun and worthwhile computer-animated adventure. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated, and the BAFTA British Academy Children's Award for Film. Very good!","

"ironhorse_iv","2 December 2015","The Good Dinosaur's production was a highly publicized tumultuous one, complete with a producer, voice cast, change, a complete overhaul of the story in which, it drop characters, and a release date postponement of over a year. Original director Bob Peterson, who came up with the idea for the story, was even let go by Pixar, and replace by Peter Sohn, however, I didn't felt like, any of those moves, save the film from being a disappointment. This latest movie from Pixar was a letdown, not only Pixar's fan, but for me. It doesn't bring, anything new to the table. The movie remind me of a bland version of 1988's The Land before Time mixed with 2000's Dinosaur. Don't get me wrong, it's tries hard to be innovative, but it comes across as dull rethread of recycle Disney animation tropes and clichés. The core of Good Dinosaur's plot is simple enough: What if the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs had missed the Earth? And, millions of years later, primitive humans and dinosaurs had to learn to coexisted. This ""boy and his dog"" film tries to tell that, with a young Apatosaurus named Arlo (voiced by Raymond Ochoa) and his ""dog"" being a feral human child whom he names Spot (voiced by Jack Bright), as they make their way home, after getting separate from their herd. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, I like how is a tale of friendship, longing for family, and overcoming fears that takes place in an alternate-history timeline, but I really couldn't stand, the main character of this film. Arlo is by far, one of the most annoying and whinny characters, I have ever witness in a Pixar film. They really made his character, way too much of a coward, social dependent, and self-centered. Yes, he get braver and less self-centered as the film goes on, but his likability is far, too weak, to be engaging to care about his redeeming character arches in the 3rd act. It's even more, annoying to watch, with how badly, the kid's voice acting, is, throughout this. You can really tell, that Raymond Ochoa's voice was very unnatural. It was really lacking any insipid. Very inexperienced. Jack Bright is not as bad, as Ochoa, as he only grunts and howls but never actually speaks words. The chemistry before them, was alright for the most part. You believe in the bond between these two, despite them, nearly wanting to kill each other, in the beginning. The moment, where they had to move on, might even, bring adults, a tear. I also didn't mind, that along the way, the main cast duo encounter pterodactyls, T-Rex, and raptors. However, I really found it, a bit jarring, that the movie is really pushing for a Western like theme. It's so awkward to see T-Rex moves as if they were cowboys riding a horse, driving a longhorn herd or seeing leaf eating Apatosaurus raise chickens for winter. Which, by the way, the farming/starving of the farm sub-plot was abandoned, once Arlo begins his journey. Nor does, it pick up, once Arlo comes back. I can clearly can see these dinosaurs dying off, by the beginnings of winter to the lack of food. If you subscribe to The Pixar Theory, it makes sense, since it possible the winters only got worse, and in time only man, buffalo, bird and other beings managed to survive the next extinction. In real life, it's the only reason why mammals, and by extension, humans that we're most familiar with evolved and diversified the way they did. One thing, I really don't get is, why Dinosaurs don't eat another dinosaurs in this world. You would think, the T-Rex would had killed him, the moment, they saw him, but no, they allowed him to join in, getting their herd, back. The supporting cast wasn't that bad, as Arlo. Mad props go to Steve Zahn as the religious zealot, Thunderclap. His voice acting is by far, the best in this film. All the supporting cast, were a lot more entertaining in their voice acting than the main cast. While, the story isn't that strong, the visual effects are amazing and beautiful. Pixar's gorgeous photo-realistic natural settings are nearly indistinguishable from actual forests, rivers, and mountains. The Good Dinosaur certainly doesn't shy away from the ever-present mortal dangers of prehistoric times with more than a few deaths (some played for laughs, others not) occurring along the way, but it comes across as unbelievable, when this kid's survive, some really bad disasters, that even bigger dinosaurs, couldn't make out, of. It doesn't paint, a realistic scenario to take the threats to him, seriously. Still, the action scenes in this film were intense, and fun to watch. The music that goes with the film was alright for the most part. Composer, Thomas Newman was originally assigned to compose music for The Good Dinosaur, but complications with Newman's schedule and further delays with the film's productions prompted him to leave. Newman was later replaced by the Academy Award-winning composer Mychael Danna. It really paints, the primitive fear that comes with that era. Overall: While, this formulaic ""find your courage"" story simply retreads a lot of well-worn narrative and thematic ground. It would be nice to see what the original production could had been. In the end, the Good Dinosaur wasn't as good as it should had, but it's clearly not the worst Pixar film, I have ever saw.","

"homerthefreak-786-658831","28 June 2016","This movie was criminally underrated. I mean this is Pixar for god's sake, you would think it would get more praise. People were so focused on Inside Out that this movie was swept aside with Minions and Hotel Transylvania 2. It is so much better than those. In fact, it's better than Inside Out. I feel like Inside Out is more of a Toy Story film and The Good Dinosaur is more of a Wall-E. Obviously Toy Story is the one people remember, but most people would say Wall-E is better. So clearly The Good Dinosaur should have won the Oscar for best animated picture. It wasn't even nominated. You know what was nominated? Inside Out. Take a wild guess which movie won the category, as well.","

"farrinda","4 December 2015","Pixar burst onto the computer animation scene with Toy Story, the first feature film to be fully computer generated. Since then, the studio has won 15 Academy Awards, boasting a number of successful films including Monsters, Inc, Ratatouille, and most recently Inside Out. Always on the cutting edge of animation technology, nearly every Pixar film finds a healthy balance of quality entertainment for children while also catering to the adults who bring them to the theater. The Good Dinosaur, the latest feature from Pixar to hit theaters, succeeds admirably in taking computer generated animation to the next level but tends to get lost in the grey area of its vastly age-different target demographic.Supposing that the meteor which led to the dinosaurs' extinction missed the Earth, the screenplay by Meg LeFauve (Inside Out) opens on a time in history near the beginning stages of man's evolution.

"michaelhirakida","11 December 2015","I don't get what your problems are people. Sure it's not a movie for all ages and it's very violent, sure it may not be Suitable For Younger Kids, and Sure it might not be remembered as well as Inside Out. BUT YOU LISTEN HERE. These 'Flaws' You have with the movies are actually it's strengths which The Good Dinosaur has. Do not be discouraged by these snobby haters, this movie is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen and will surely leave a great impact on you once you leave the theater! It's Marvelous! It's a Miracle! It's now one of my favorite movies! First lets start off with the beginning. This movie acts like a Pre Historic Western. The whole film starts on a farm owned by Dinosaurs! That is new and original. I have never seen anything like this before and it surely wowed me. The characters I can connect to because it reminds me of my family. Our families have strengths and flaws like these characters do. Arlo goes through the most toughest of challenges and is hurt many times. But his pain is our suffering, he overcomes this greatly in the movie and by the very end, he is a more mature young dinosaur and gets the reward it deserves.Speaking of Rewards, THIS MOVIE IS VERY REWARDING. Oh it's too violent Oh it's too adult Oh it's Immature BLAH BLAH BLAH. NO! This movie is super rewarding and is a tough movie to watch especially for kids. But by the end, they will look back on this experience and learn from what we saw. The whole thing is Pixar's most explicit film yes, but if you don't give it a chance, you will not understand and be covered by fat thick ignorance. I bet these people on here didn't give the movie a stinking chance, but for those who did, the filmmakers probably really appreciate it.This is a powerful film and I cried lots at the end. Arlo and Spot are probably one of the best duos I have seen in any film. Their relationship is very complex. Arlo is very angry and hateful at the beginning to him but he is forgiving in the end and you want to see them accomplish what they set out for. But I think everyone can agree that the animation is brilliant and the most realistic out of any Pixar Film to date. I thought I was looking at a animated live action hybrid at some points and that is good animating. The trees, the water, the landscapes, everything is done perfectly.The only problem I did have with it was that the movie's Villains are very under developed. We barely see them and the movie wants us to think they are threatening which they are, but because everything is else is so well developed it should make sense they should be more developed! But no! They are mostly out of the spotlight for the rest of the movie until the end.But the climax of the movie is awesome and stunning. There are barely any words spoken at the end of the movie and its last shot remains one of the greatest shots I have ever seen on film. Arlo as I mentioned does overcome his fears which is what we can all relate to. We can all relate to being scared by a lot of things and does the movie say we shouldn't be scared at all? No! The movie actually has this mature theme of even in the greatest moments of battle, you will always be scared. That's just genius and I'm glad they didn't go for some sugar coated bull like Oh don't be scared because that's wrong its OK To be scared!So I think I have said enough for the movie. This movie is getting unfairly treated like The Hobbit Trilogy and should be respected more. Don't listen to these dumb haters who have no idea what they're talking about. The Good Dinosaur is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen and has now become one of my all time favorite movies. If you see it, SEE IT WITH AN OPEN MIND! Don't be discouraged! If you didn't like it, Fine I can live with that. If you had some problems with it, That's OK! But don't crap on this movie just because it's not this or not that or whatever! Just watch it and see for yourself!It's coming close to the end of the year and I think it's safe to say now that The Good Dinosaur is my pick for the Best Movie Of The Year.99/100 A (I think this is the first time a Movie with a lower rating is my favorite film of the year instead of the higher rated one)","

I stilled had those feeling moments, where you think awww and that's nice, but it is missing something, it doesn't hit you in the feelings like some of the other :)It is a sweet story, some lovable characters, but the most stunning in this is the whole scenery, the nature, the liveliness of it all. It just looks so real and you really want to go some of these places, because if they didn't have big dinosaurs or creepy insects etc. they look to be a very nice place to spend a holiday. It is truly amazing how great it all looks, if for nothing else, go see it for that.Location, seating & time: Falkoner, Nordisk Film, Frederiksberg, Denmark - Bio 2, row 11 seat 10, 12, 14 & 16 - 09.01.2016 at 12.30","

Even the six year old who loves dinosaurs was disappointed . At the prices of 3 d movie wish had my money back. If you think your going to a fun enjoyable dinosaur movie,think again more like sadness of Bambi with a mediocre plot line.. The story for a Pixar movie was no were up to par with Nemo. The friendship of spot and the little dinosaur was one of the bright spots of the movie. The previews were not a good representation of the movie. The movie need to flesh out the supporting characters.","

"dslamb-85066","30 November 2015","If I may caveat this review first. You know your children better than I do, and will know if they are able to handle the content of this movie.First, I don't feel this movie was well marketed. In fact, I found it misleading. I think they presented it as a typical child friendly animated movie with a goofy looking green dinosaur and his silly companion (human/dog) on an adventure. Certainly, Pixar films often include content that is oriented to older audience members, but have maintained a balance that appeals to all ages.The Good Dinosaur, however, fails at this. It is a surprisingly violent movie, and not a cartoonish violence. There is a flash flood that kills a character within the first 30 minutes, and a flashback later in the movie, with a second flood in the finale. It isn't unusual for the character of any animated film to undergo a trauma (e.g. the Lion King), but whereas those maintain an animated feel, the flash flood was very realistic. The whole movie is a strange contrast between the cartoonish green dino and a very realistic natural environment. The visuals are impressive to be honest. My son (6) found the flash flood and the thunderstorms to be terrifying, combined with the loud sound effects and darkened theater. There were also the ""bad dinosaurs"" that demolished a little furry mammal, and fought over the carcass. And a strange triceratops that tried to name the human/dog character by calling it ""murderer"" and other violent names. It was really bizarre.So as a parent, I give it 2 stars, because it was not age appropriate for younger kids, and I don't think there has been sufficient warning about the content of this film. I guess I can't let Pixar just slide by given its past work, and should try and find out more about their films before going. As I say at the start, your kid may not be bothered by the elements in the movie, and certainly older ones will be better able. If your kid has a fear of natural disasters, def. skip it.As an audience member, I might give it 5 stars. Beyond the really impressive natural landscapes they have created, the story is quite boring. It is a traditional, boy on adventure finding himself style movie. It has been done so many times before, and better.","

"dkbowzer","12 December 2015","I am still unsure if I enjoyed the movie, the wounds are too raw. It was an emotional roller coaster and not appropriate for children (or adults) with sensitive feelings. For young children there are several scenes that are intense and scary. The good dinosaur went through internal and emotional turmoil, feelings of depression and revenge. The movie follows him as he grows and matures but it is a painful process, even without much dialog. The good thing i can say about it is that the animation of the surroundings was beautiful, although they didn't spend as much effort on the animation of the characters themselves.","

"imadriaz-31418","7 December 2015","In one phrase....this is the most disturbing Pixar, or quite possibly any animated movie that I have seen till date. This movie glorifies death and killing in a way no movie has as yet done.Had the movie not been so colorful, I doubt it would have made a PG rating. Either that, or the censor board is starting to forget that animated movies are watched by 2-4 year olds ALSO!!Kids in the theatre were crying, my three year old kept asking questions that I had no answer to since I have never exposed my kids to such stuff. My only advice to parents - please see the Parental Advisory on IMDb before watching this movie. Lastly, I'm all for celebrating diversity and other religions, but never expected Pixar to start preaching hinduism as part of its opening short. Sorry - but thats a big fail in my book.","

"videokid-98-228406","4 February 2016","People are overreacting about this movie. I first read the reviews in this page and went to the cinema prepared for the worst, and let me tell you that it was not THAT bad, I actually enjoyed it, as well as the other people that were there, kids included. The scenarios are absolutely marvelous, they look so life like but still matches with the simple design of the characters. The plot is nothing new that we haven't see in other movies, is pretty simple and predictable, as the dialogues, but well. The movie has some funny moments and some other heart warming ones. I didn't see anything disgusting about this movie, maybe some people is a little susceptible. I don't find a bug without head or hallucinations something kids can't see or be traumatized by, the kids in the theater laughed a lot on that part and I find it myself the funniest part in the movie. That's my kind of humor, I guess that is not suitable for everyone but well. This movie is not as bad as I expected. Note: People complaining about the death of Arlo's father clearly never watched the lion king, right?","

This movie was pretty slow, and when various critters they show first as cute are suddenly eaten before my children's eyes, that was the end of the movie for us. This came after the scene where one character rips the head off another creature. My children were alternately bored and scared - definitely not what you expect in a Disney children's film. Not a film for little kids (preschool or younger) with some scenes that are guaranteed to give my young ones some nightmares and yet too boring with almost no comedy for children beyond grade school or adults.

"teachck","7 January 2016","Warning: Contains spoilers.I'd like to start off by saying I had high expectations for this movie. It seemed like a unique premise from the trailers and it was coming from Pixar which has its share of top-quality movies. Issue One: This movie was rather disturbing for young audiences The main character gets tricked into lifting a log that an animal is hiding under by vulture type dinosaurs with large teeth. The animal is then eaten alive! -The main dinosaur is told to kill a human boy by his presumably good father -A boy unintentionally pulls the head off of a massive insect, which dies (well, that was pointless) -The main character, Arlo, is visibly bruised and bloody in scenes -And his father dies in a flood -And his mother is show weak, and overexertedIssue Two: AnimationThe animation in 'The Good Dinosaur', I felt was very strange. The animation is very realistic in parts, and there are some gorgeous nature scenes reminiscent of something you would see from National Geographic. Sometimes I found it hard to tell if something was animated or filmed traditionally. And then there were poorly animated cartoon dinosaurs. The combination did not mix at all. I felt almost as if Pixar was showing off its animation skills without caring about character integration or plot.Issue Three: Yep, the plot.Pixar has had some really great ideas. The Good Dinosaur, however, had a ridiculously simplistic plot that seemed to cater to 6 year olds. A six year old plot, with 10 year old violence.Issue Four: Voices and dialogueThroughout most of the movie, the main character, a dinosaur named Arlo could be heard whining, complaining, or yelling as he got injured. Where are the nuances in the plot. Where are the communications and dialogues that make you really grow close to the characters (such as in Frozen or Up).Something was definitely missing from the Good Dinosaur. Hopefully, Pixar can get their act together. The movie started off well enough, with some cute scenes of Arlo's parents watching him hatch but then went steadily downhill from there.","

My 5 year old Grandson asked to leave because he didn't like it. He never has asked to leave before a movie is over. I expected the same quality as Toy Story, and Finding Nemo. Boy was I wrong!The opening accompanying cartoon was also very scary and definitely not for little kids.","

Can't believe how off the mark this movie is from Disney - Disney, shame on you!! Get some new writers who are in touch with children! And what a ridiculous story line. Seriously? A family of Apatosaurus dinosaurs who farm corn - Monsanto must have loved this movie - wonder if their corn was grown from GMO seeds? They really could have fed the whole world!! how many millions of years ago was this? Pathetic overall.","

"mblanchard-896-97582","8 January 2016","Whilst there are many people speaking out against the numerous polysemic cliff-hangers and plots, it is important to acknowledge that it is good that Pixar don't always create films that are wholeheartedly sweet. After all, nursery rhymes often include morals and hidden messages underneath their child-friendly exteriors. This film had me absolutely gripped by its excellent character development, where you absolutely invest in the protagonist. This could be one of the reasons why the film is such a roller-coaster ride: because you truly adore the main characters. Overall, I love the fact that this film is different, gritty (for a children's film!) and thrilling. One of Pixar's greatest.","

"atmommy","9 December 2015","This movie is completely inappropriate for young children. My three and five year old were very disturbed by the dark and violent plot. Half- way through the movie another child yelled out, ""I don't like this movie."" And many others loudly agreed. Between this and the scary short before, my three year old has began to have nightmares. It was just too intense. I wish I would have read reviews before basing my opinion on it through the trailer, which lends no reason to believe the movie would be inappropriate. *****Spoiler***** Like in many Disney movies, the parent dies. Not only do we have to sit through an intense scene watching his death, but we get to see it replayed in an even more upsetting manner. There also many violent scenes that made my children and I gasp- like when a creature pretends to save a cute little animal only to scarf it down psychotically. There are some sweet touching moments in this movie but overall the plot is not entertaining. Because of this, intense and violent scenes are thrown in to keep you on your toes. But for this mama, it just kept me stressed wondering how much of this would bother my children. And unfortunately, it left them very upset. If you have sensitive young children, just don't do it!","

"neil-476","4 December 2015","Following a disastrous flood, young dinosaur Arlo is separated from his farming family (parents and two siblings). During his long journey back to find them, he is accompanied by a caveboy who he calls Spot. Pixar's latest feature is somewhat of a disappointment. The story is a straightforward series of obstacles to be overcome, and the subtext is minimal and delivered rather hamfistedly – there is none of the subtlety of the Toy Story films, Wall-E, Up, or Inside Out. This is not to say that it isn't a perfectly good kids' movie, or that adults won't enjoy it – I did – but one has come to expect rather more from Pixar than is delivered here.The visuals are, unsurprisingly, amazing – the landscape is spectacular, gorgeous, and completely convincing. The trouble is that they may as well have used real landscapes, and perhaps they did. I don't think one should look at a CGI feature and say that it is indistinguishable from reality: that is one of the functions of CGI in special effects in (ostensibly) live-action movies. Having said that, beauty is beauty and merits credit where it is due.But, for me, this film does not join the list of Pixar classics.","

"Kareneo","27 December 2019","I think the reason this movie doesn't work is that it is VERY very preachy, and forgets the whole point of childhood is to first: have fun! The Pixar films that have fun as their central motivating force are the movies that work. This movie begins on the premise that you are not worthy of love unless you jump through the hoops the adults have set in place for you before you were even born. A nightmare of a childhood is when you are constantly told you must earn worthiness, instead of just being loved. A rather horrible film really. I do not recommend it.","

"danNQ","1 January 2016","I've never reviewed before but made an account just for this. My 4 and a half year old daughter was a mess after this movie, my 4 year old niece was worse. It was an emotional onslaught for the kids. Very few light hearted moments to break up to constant high intensity of it. Everything from parents dying, loneliness, everything trying to kill them and sad goodbyes. It was barely punctuated by any humour, and the ""happy ending"" was an afterthought after a sad goodbye that kicked my girl right in the feels and broke her down. I could hear kids crying all around the cinema through it and more than one family left early. At the end half the kids were in their parents laps, including my own. I can see what they were going for, but they fell short. Maybe for kids around 10, but for the demographic it was targeted at....no thanks.","

"dronzilla","9 April 2016","This is a very deep and thought provoking movie. It's not for everyone and that's a key reason why there are so many bad reviews. It's not a ''relax your brain'' type of entertainment. Instead it makes you ask questions and think.The movie is not about pure animation (which is brilliant) or music (also brilliant) or even plot (decent). It's about the message.I don't know what the target audience of the movie is intended to be - that's usually not important. But I think the target audience of the message are teenagers or kids that are approaching the age where its time to leave the parent's nest. The message is for them.The message is simple yet powerful: as you move out of your home, you will be on your own for the first time. It will be tough, you will make mistakes. You will be making right and wrong decisions, meeting good and bad people: some will act good but turn out to be bad, some will look bad (stereotypes?) but turn out to be good and become your best friends. The important thing is to not give up, continue to learn, grow as an individual. As you grow you will realize that you can do more than you've ever imagined.This movie reminds me of Meet the Robinsons. Another exceptional Disney cartoon with a great message. I highly recommend both.","

Here's the list in dot points. -Outrageously bland story. - Ridiculously boring and poorly designed characters. The scenery in the rolling credits shows what Pixar can do, yet the dinosaurs are blocky, ugly and one coloured. -NO NEED FOR THE CHARACTERS TO BE DINOSAURS. It's clearly just thrown in to drag in kids. Yet it's horrible for children considering all the unnecessary violent language. -Misleading title. Why is he even a good dinosaur? All he does is let a critter out of a net & proceed to go on murdering other dinosaurs. -Weird drug reference that is neither comical or relevant.Here's the story for you all so you can avoid it forever:Dinosaur is weak, Father dies, gets swept down river, finds way home. THE END. Not even kidding.","

"capone666","14 February 2016","The Good DinosaurIf an asteroid hadn't wiped out the dinosaurs than the Flintstones would have been the first reality TV show.Instead, this family-movie reimagines that non-extinction scenario as a cartoon.After losing his father (Jeffrey Wright), a naïve dinosaur named Arlo (Raymond Ochoa) is separated from his mother (Frances McDormand) during a flood and forced to find his way back home.En route, Arlo befriends a laconic cave-boy he names Spot, and receives guidance from an array of prehistoric predators (Sam Elliott, Anna Paquin, Steve Zahn) who may or may not want to eat the travelling companions.With unconventional character designs, mature themes involving loss and scary scenes of animal- on-animal violence, The Good Dinosaur is a definite departure from Pixar's predictably upbeat output.Unfortunately, none of these new elements help make this black sheep a classic. On the bright side, if dinosaurs had survived we'd all be wearing Velociraptor leather coats. Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca","

"shaypay-56239","21 December 2015","Let's be honest: We've all seen bad movies before. But, did you expect one from Pixar? I definitely didn't. I entered the theatre with my dear friend, eager to see a cute and hilarious movie about a dinosaur and his human companion. I was wrong. The short featuring the little, Indian boy was actually cute. I loved it! It was an adorable way to portray Hinduism. I was happy to see it, however I'm worried some kids didn't understand it. Like Inside Out, it was enjoyable for adults but not for children. Our story begins with a pair of dinosaurs on a farm. The movie seemed okay so far; good graphics and a good start. (Speaking of the graphics, they were probably the best graphics I have ever seen. I hope they stick to the hyper realistic style.) Anyway, three baby dinosaurs were born. One of the babies was the protagonist– named Arlo– and he was the smallest and wimpy of the three. Once again, it was a good movie so far. I thought my friend and I were in for a treat. But, everything changed when the dad forced Arlo to almost murder a baby human. What?! Is this a PG film anymore? The father drowns in a very graphic way and Arlo runs away from his starving family. ""This reminds me too much of the Lion King,"" My friend and I both agreed. This movie recycled plots over 2 movies! Then, some more kid-inappropriate scenes occur: Arlo is manipulated into saving a baby creature, to which another dinosaur eats it psychotically, Arlo's companion is nearly eaten alive, and Arlo and Spot (his companion) eat hallucinogenic-like berries to which they have a euphoric reaction (anyone get reminded of Dumbo?). How were these scenes even accepted into the movie?! Besides the inappropriate scenes, the movie was very bland and there were hardly any comedic scenes at all– and even less, comedic scenes that were actually funny. In fact, the movie was so unfunny that I found the audience funnier and more entertaining! Also, Arlo rejected Spot's desire to return to his family... what?! That's ridiculous! Anyway— though it did make my friend and the audience cry a little— please do not see this movie. It's the worst Pixar movie I have ever seen. You WILL be disappointed and you WILL leave the theatre thinking that you wasted your own money. Save your money for an actual good movie, like the Lion King.","

"hoanglyt","18 June 2016","I get that people are dismissing this movie because the story is simple and the character's design are not as sophisticated as the scenery. But that is the MAGIC. I watched this with my 6 year old daughter in theater and we laughed, we cried, we were terrified, and most importantly we were mesmerized. Prixar did not fail when it came to animating the scenery. Especially of earth 65 millions years ago. The water, the leaves, the critters were very realistic and it felt like I was watching Planet Earth half the time. Mixed with the sounds I swear I can taste the crisp of the fresh water. When it came to the characters it was designed more like a Disney cartoon with the big eyes and very simple lines. To me, it made sense because this is after all a children's movie and not Jurassic Park. Apparently this annoyed the adults. The story itself is a becoming of age told in a very old fashion way. Old fashion means it's not baby proof. The child must get hurt to learn. That is another no-no for (certain) parents. For me, it was a raw emotional roller coaster with an amazing backdrop for me to appreciate. The characters with large puppy-like eyes that expressed emotions that made my heart shadow it. The only complaint that I have was that I wished someone told me to bring some tissue!!!! I cried so much. I am a crier but this was really busting me up. I gave it a 10 because both child and adult got the message and were rocked to the core. Also because of so many negative reviews that it made this movie more of a hidden gem.","

"fourstringwizard","9 April 2016","For some reason, even though I don't review movies often, I was compelled to write a review on this one (probably because I was shocked that Pixar could even put their name on this, let alone after a movie as great as ""Inside Out""). I finally saw this as a Red Box rental, and when it was done, I was amazed...at how bad it was.So why was it bad? (My in-depth, spoiler-containing review is below), but to summarize, this movie was riddled with scenes that were either pointless, violent, or downright disturbing, and not at all appropriate for little children. The tone was all over the place, the characters were un-compelling, the emotions were forced, and overall it just wasn't fun to watch. If you're a parent and are debating whether to show this to your kids, my advice is don't. For my longer, spoiler-containing review: First off, I'll address probably the best thing about this movie: the animation. The background animation is stellar. It's so good, some parts look as though they're real footage. However, that said, the characters themselves look like they were taken out of a Gary Larson cartoon. It contrasts very awkwardly with the ultra-realistic backgrounds. I get that this may have been intentional, but it just doesn't work here.The context of the story is this: dinosaurs have evolved and can speak, farm, and build structures, and human beings are basically dogs. I have a really hard time taking both these concepts seriously, but I realize that's more of a personal thing, so that's all I'll say on that. For the main characters, you have Arlo (the dinosaur), who starts out as an unlikable wimp, and Spot (the human boy) who swings between funny and irritating quite often. As far as the tone, it's all over the place. This movie doesn't know if it wants to be tragic, sad, scary, or happy. But to make matters worse, it goes overboard on the dark/disturbing parts. Some examples of this:-The main character's dad getting killed in a flood (more on that later) -Spot ripping a giant bug's head off with his teeth -A dinosaur brutally eating an animal it had just pretended to rescue -Arlo and Spot eating a drug plant and hallucinating -A dinosaur bragging about drowning a gator in a pool of his own bloodYup, this all from a 'kid's' movie. Now, a lot of reviewers have compared the scene of Arlo's dad dying to ""Lion King"", and rightly so. There are a lot of parallels between the two scenes. However, the father's death in ""Lion King"" served a purpose. It was foreshadowed and served as the catalyst for the rest of the plot. In ""The Good Dinosaur"", however, Arlo's father dying is utterly pointless. The story could have turned out largely the same if he'd lived. And that's what this movie is full of - brutality just for brutality's sake. Even in the end, the emotions feel forced. The movie wants you to feel sad and emotional for how things turn out, but the emotion isn't earned (if that makes any sense). So in the end, I guess what I'm saying is, stick with ""Inside Out.""","

"grintemcstinger","1 March 2016","The Good Dinosaur is definitely an odd-ball among Pixar movies. What makes it stick out like a sore thumb is that it actually dares to drastically step away for your typical Disney/Pixar ""happily ever after"" formula. Especially for Disney which kinda are known for favouring feel-good cliché stories over harsh morals. This film goes for the later however in quite a few of its attempts, it falls flat because in some instances the makers did not understand how to go about it, which for a studio this big is baffling. I'm all for a kids movie dealing with death, mortality, morals and teaching them that nothing in life is granted - it's only natural. However, even when it isn't trying to teach things and is purely goofing around, there are always crass scenes like for example an giant bugs head being ripped off (while alive no less) which truly make my forehead wrinkle thinking ""what the fudge were they thinking!?"" Those scenes are frustrating and unnecessary it's almost overwhelming, and it's unfortunate, because it really makes all the good moments easy to forget and ignore. And there are fairly enough of them too. What to me started as a pretty bad movie, progressively got better toward the end, but it definitely required some tolerance along the way. And in the end it came of a solid film, but still I can see why parents won't be pleased with this one.Technically there is little doubt that this is state of the art. While the characters themselves seem pretty basic, the world around them is anything but. There is so much detail, various materials and elements (like water, earth...) behaving with incredible realism. Best landscapes too. They have set the bar higher with this one.Doing rough and harsh life lessons in movies aimed at younger audiences can be done right as some in the past have proved, but it's obviously not an easy thing to do and requires much finesse. ""The Good Dinosaur"" struggles in that regard and sometimes handles thing badly and inappropriate. Still there is also a fair amount of moments where it shines and manages to get the message across, and it shouldn't be judged sorely on the negatives. All said it's a decent one. It may or may not be Pixars worst, but it still isn't bad.","

"gavin6942","24 April 2016","In a world where dinosaurs and humans live side-by-side, an Apatosaurus named Arlo makes an unlikely human friend.This was a misfire for Pixar, and they know it. It went through development heck, switching plots and directors and dragging on for years. They released it at a time to try to maximize sales and still fell short of their goal. It was profitable, but by far the least profitable of any Pixar film to date.And it is easy to see why. The premise is somewhat interesting, with the comet (or asteroid or whatever) missing earth, thus leading to advanced dinosaurs and the rise of humans. That's clever. Some of the animation -- especially the water -- is also really good. But these are very flat characters and a very thin plot. We expect depth from Pixar, and this film has none. Comparing it to ""Inside Out"" and it is easy to see why one is loved and honored and the other is already -- five months after release -- forgotten. At the core of a good film is the character, and this film lacks that.","

"justincroman","31 January 2021","In my opinion the movie would have been much better if the dad had not have died, it was unnecessary to kill the father when there were so many other ways to come out with the same outcome. Also if he had still been alive the family reunion would have made a much interesting impact and really done what the movie set out to do.","

"ThomasDrufke","27 November 2015","Pixar doesn't make bad movies, they just don't. Brave, Monsters U, and now The Good Dinosaur are easily my least favorite from their lore. But by no means are any of them bad. Pixar pretty much hits 95% of their films out of the park, so when a harmless little film like The Good Dinosaur comes out that is just okay, I can't be mad. I enjoyed The Good Dinosaur but it's also a rehash of some of Pixar's and other animated films same plot points to drive home relatively the same story.Centered upon the far fetched yet still interesting idea of 'what if the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs never actually made it to earth?'. We find Arlo, a unique long neck dinosaur who is struggling to 'make his mark' within his own family, suffers a family tragedy and is stuck with a 'critter'(human) named Spot to find his way home. Taking some of the same plot points as Finding Nemo, The Lion King, and even Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, The Good Dinosaur makes its own mark with beautiful animation, even if the touching story has been told before. As Arlo and Spot travel through various obstacles and come across numerous other creatures, sometimes the story of the two of them creating a unique relationship, is lost in the shuffle as Arlo goes through his own troubles. Ultimately, that's one of the issues with the film. I really dug the quiet moments between Arlo and Spot discovering each other's own lives through non-verbal actions. But in reality, the focus is on Arlo's own struggles to overcome his fears internally. It's not as focused or fluid as most of Pixar's other films. I think this is one of those safer films for Pixar. They didn't take enough chances.But there's plenty of enjoyment to be had with the incredible animation, unique dynamic between two outsiders, and another great adventure story from Pixar. Similarities to other films may be too close for comfort and the lack of a big villain doesn't give the film the push it needs, but I think families and Pixar fans alike with enjoy this one.+Animation+Twist on the dinosaur story-But a few too many similarities to animated classics-Nothing too big happens, not enough chances taken7.1/10","

"wonderland23","22 January 2016","Children are not to be treated as lightly as children movies nowadays do. In my vision, this movie is extremely important to expose complex issues that have always followed us (like death, fear and drugs) to younger audiences. I read people complaining about how scary was the movie, how inappropriate it was to have a scene that made a reference to drugs and how loud the children cried during the movie's exhibition. I bet those ""concerned parents"" didn't look at their children's dazzled faces on beautiful and meaningful scenes like the one in which fireflies show the dinosaur that he shouldn't be afraid of the night. No, those parents rage about that one shot that brings the dinosaur and the little boy closer because of the fact that they share such explicit tragedies. Yes, your child will get sad, yes, they will cry. But this whole movie is about how scared and sad we can be and still fight it, it has, above all, an important message that needs the impact of those scenes to be carried to the public in the way it has to. Life is not a pink bubble, it's full of darkness and ugly monsters, and this movie shows kids that they can overcome them. C'mon, it's not nearly as violent as most children's TV shows, but is way more meaningful than all of them brought together.This movie is beautiful and necessary.","

"Chaokage","10 February 2016","I just logged in just to say these few words. I never had the chance to write a review about a movie before until I saw this one. Lots of people before me rated it poorly claiming many things that are not true at all. This movie may have a story we've seen so many time before but succeeds in making us get touched by the story of a dinosaur who gets lost and his journey into becoming worthy. In his journey, he makes a companion out of a little human boy and the plot is about these two and how in the end no one is ever alone. You may lose someone in your life, but that doesn't mean you are alone. I can tell you that this story related to the human part of us and everyone who rated this Pixar movie as a failure failed big time to be HUMAN. Do not listen to these people who claim things randomly thinking they know it all. I can tell you that when a movie fails to make an audience cry in a moment meant to be a sad moment is a failure. This movie succeeded and amazingly in each moment It presented. This movie is one of the best movie I ever watched. Thank you Pixar for this amazing work and shame on those who failed to be human!!!","

"SquigglyCrunch","20 June 2016","The Good Dinosaur follows a young dinosaur who, after being separated from his family, attempts to travel home along with a young boy, who has also lost his family. I liked the sets and backgrounds for this movie. They were beautiful and realistic, and really gave me hope that the movie might be less cartoon-ish and more different from what Disney usually does. Nope. The second the dinosaurs showed up my friends and I all started complaining and laughing. They look awful, especially with the realistic backgrounds. Seriously, what happened? Did the set animators and dinosaur animators work separately and just not communicate? Then when they put their stuff together Disney-Pixar just said ""Eh, screw it. We gotta get another movie out before the end of the year. We don't have time to reanimate this. It's not like the kids will notice anyways, and we'll still make buckets of money!"" Now what do I mean by it's a by-the-books Disney movie? Well, I watched a large portion of this movie in French. I don't even speak French, and yet I understood this movie perfectly. I did get vague translations, but everything is so predictable and stupid. It was like Disney- Pixar just took some of their most popular movies and copy-pasted scenes into this movie until it was made. There were a handful of other weird inconsistencies, like people switching between walking and crawling for no reason, and Arlo the dinosaur's neck stretching farther than physically possible. Normally I'd avoid complaining about these things, but there were so many that it just built up until I had to dock off an extra point. Overall The Good Dinosaur is a bad movie. It's just bad. Don't watch it. At best, it's the most average Disney-Pixar movie in existence. I'd say this is actually the worst Disney-Pixar movie I've ever seen. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, even if you like the studio.","

They have such an amazing track record of incredible animated films that they've really raised the bar on themselves. The Good Dinosaur while visually stunning is a bit bland in the story department. It isn't bad or anything, it's just remarkably unremarkable. Which, by Pixar standards, is a failure.Still, a meh Pixar movie is a decent experience and while I don't put this one particularly high on the Pixar list, it's worth watching, even if just for the animation.","

"oscaralbert","5 December 2015",". . . in this apparent prequel to THE FLINTSTONES. In THE GOOD DINOSAUR, reptiles rule the roost--NOT mammals--as even primates serve primarily as a food source. The reptiles here have tear ducts, and speak The Queen's English. People can howl, grunt, and groan, but that's about it in the way of human communication skills. It turns out that before their Great Cataclysm, dinosaurs were on the verge of discovering agriculture, complete with plowed furrows, mechanized seeding, personalized irrigation, and grain silos. They also were on track to develop domesticated fowl flocks and herds of mammoth-sized buffalo. (Though their Civilization featured many familiar professions, there's no hint here of Humanity's ""Oldest"" one.) Trade was very primitive; monetary systems seem to be missing. This Dinotopia is predicated upon Jurassic Park's Real Life Extinction Event being caused by a slow-moving asteroid (deflected here by some sort of Butterfly Effect)--NOT History's speedy meteor crashing into the Gulf of Mexico (causing BP's well to blow out a bit later, according to Team Trump).","

Every once in a while someone would say ""I hate being scared and I don't wanna be scared anymore."" It's best to say, the design used was just breathtaking/looked so real. Seriously, just take a good look, and the landscape... Just amazing. I personally don't think this movie should get too much hate. It's probably the best animated dinosaur movie to date. Though, as much as I want a sequel. I don't think it's going to happen because of how much hate this movie has gotten. Still I for sure will treasure this movie and put it in with the rest of the Dinosaur box to show my history of the past. Sure, there was a lot a violence and a lot of ""Mature"" conversations/arguments, but face it people it was such a great movie. Why do most of you have to hate?

Loved the nice scenes and music and loved the characters Spot and Arlo. So many over protective mothers and fathers gave harsh reviews because they are too sheltered and could not handle a realistic movie about the real life survival instincts of a few dinosaurs! Lol.Yes there were scenes of dinosaurs eating other living animals and dialogue from dinosaurs talking of their survival stories all of which was appropriate for the movies time setting which was 100 million years ago! The last thing i would have wanted to see was dinosaurs acting like civilized animals in a fantasy world where all dinosaurs ate nothing but GRASS and BERRIES! I think that would have been much worse and also very boring for the movie.Great job Pixar! look forward to seeing more movies of this quality and standard!","

"subxerogravity","25 November 2015","It's everything you love about a Pixar movie. The Good Dinosaur, explores a world where the dinosaurs never became extinct and centers around one name Arlo, a scared young dino who befriends a human cave boy while getting lost in the wilderness, and must survive a scary terrain as he finds his way home.It's a wonderfully done story about an unlikely duo working together, and bonding, as well as a story about finding the courage within yourself. The voice cast that they used was actually spectacular, especially the kids they used to voice Arlo and the rest of the young dinos. And that terrain was scary indeed. This movie had some creepy elements to it. Some so... ""interesting"" that I'm surprised it made it into a kids movie. Guess they justified it by saying this happens in nature. It reminds me of Disney animation from the 1980s like, The Black Cauldron.For those of you who remember the late 80's animated classic, The Land Before Time, than this movie is definitively for you. The Good Dinosaur is a Great Movie.","

"christian-larson","27 November 2015","The Good Dinosaur is Pixars second feature film, that is about a dinosaur that gets separated from its family and meets this kid that will guide him home. The Good Dinosaur is really not Pixars best movie, but it is really a really good story. However, the plot is kind of used already and you can predict what is going to happen. But is the beautiful scenery and characters that really makes this movie shine. The background is utterly fantastic, every single thing looks real and beautiful. The character Arlo, starts kind of weak but in time, he evolves into a real dinosaur. The kid named spot helps the protagonist interact with something, but Spot also has a backstory and he explains it in a heartbreaking way in a beach. There is also a scene where the T-rex's need to get to a herd, and it really is not that interesting and kind of derail the movie. But the part the dinosaurs wanted to tell Arlo, is that fear is necessary to see what really are you made of, but they tell it in such a rushed way, the message is really not clear. Also the first 15-20 min. are really not interesting but later it picks right up with Spot and Arlo and we get a really great story in between the bond they share. The Good Dinosaur is not nearly as good as Inside Out, but its really a good story and some really memorable characters. 8.5/10","

"xviagent-60306","6 January 2016","This film is cutely animated but completely warped in its nuances about human existence. Even from an evolutionary point of view it is ludicrous, assigning dog-like characteristics to early humans. Basically, the movie is dehumanizing nonsense not fit for a young audience, nor any other audience for that matter.Human characteristics are instead transferred to the animals, in particular dinosaurs. The human child (main supporting character) makes dog-like sounds and exhibits dog behavior, whereas the dinosaurs and most other animals in the movie take on human characteristics (anthropomorphism). Granted, the movie is fictional but it misses an opportunity to engage the audience convincingly because of this ridiculous notion. Give it a miss!","

It would have been a great direct to DVD animated movie, but for a cinematic release it lacked a lot of qualities that even Hotel Transylvania (1 and 2) had.... and that's not a compliment (though they didn't suck half as much as this movie). The story is weak, the character dept is lacking on all fronts, you can't get into feeling very attached or emphatic to the main character..... The visuals are nice, but there's too much landscape and too little story..... Still, the story has the classic Disney elements with the necessary sad part in the beginning, the 'Long Haul/Journey' in the middle, but it misses critical scenes that are worth remembering and the deeper elements that makes a movie 'classic'. It feels as if not enough effort was put into the story. And the end is.... well.... way to abrupt. Seems they just got fed up with the project and wanted to end it quickly instead of aiming to do something memorable... Which they maybe did to make sure budget didn't explode....Worth a watch on TV, not in a theater....","

"scottca075","18 November 2015","Another terrific movie from Pixar and Disney. Let's start with the easy stuff, the craft of the movie itself. It is amazing how far the state of the art has come since Pixar first started making movies. The animation is seamless and deep. The characters move with such dexterity and you can read the emotions with out the words or music. The backgrounds are equally magnificent.But as great as the animation is, the story, as with all Pixar movies is what makes it truly great. The story is familiar, a boy and his dog..... er dinosaur, and it is even predictable. You know how it is going to end (more or less), but what makes it great is how it gets there; how the bond and friendship forms and how they face adversity together. The movie has a lot of heart, that same kind of heart that they brought to Toy Story 3.Given the timing and season, I expect this to be a big hit, maybe not to the level of Frozen, but I think it will have legs.","

This is very very substandard for Pixar, there's a complete lack of story, plot, characterisation, creativity and most crucially imagination. It doesn't really show us anything that we haven't seen before in other movies such as The Land Before Time or even Disney's Dinosaur from 2000; actually, those two movies were way better than this one. Heck, it doesn't even have the usual Pixar charm to win you over, all the characters were pretty annoying - including the main character - he's just this moany, whiny, spineless weakling who's scared of EVERYTHING, and it's his chicken sh*t antics that get his dad killed. Oh, and the dad is annoying too - he's self-righteous and condescending, the siblings are obnoxious, and so on. The only character who was of any interest was Spot - he had more charm and more character than anyone else - and he didn't even say anything!","

"KineticSeoul","13 July 2016","To me, this movie was a real snore fest. I am sure this is my least favorite Pixar movie so far. There really isn't much at all when it comes to the narrative or any creativity. There is also nothing new to experience besides the very well crafted and detailed CGI when it comes to the background. Although the dinosaur characters are done very cartoony the background is pretty gorgeous with it's sceneries. So yeah, besides the CGI background, I was just completely bored with this and just wanted it to end after about 15 minutes in. It's one of those CGI family flick that I personally would not want to sit through again. There is few gross scenes in there that I didn't expect from a Pixar movie. I am not sure if it's to get a reaction from the audiences, but it just wasn't effective. This movie went through development and production difficulties and even switched directors. I though the message is good, but it has been conveyed better in other family flicks. It's like they had an idea of the story taking place in a what if situation. Of what if the asteroid missed earth and all the dinosaurs survived. After that they just didn't have enough materials or ideas to go off of after that. Sure, this might be a family flick aimed at the children. But I don't see how even kids could be drawn in and entertained by this movie. I would have just forgotten it as soon as I saw it. Because just about nothing sticks out about this Pixar movie. It's not a super awful family movie, but it's a very boring and forgettable family movie.4/10","

"roshan-245-24837","16 February 2016","Audiences worldwide have come to expect a very high standard from the folks at Disney and Pixar, so there is no soft way to say this but: The Good Dinosaur just doesn't hold up with the rest of their achievements. There is, however, something positive to be said about their masterful animation and graphics. There is no doubt that The Good Dinosaur offers something immersive and cinematically beautiful to the viewers. The environment that we witness is both enchanting and vivid, something that Pixar fans have become very accustomed to. Apart from the flora and fauna being so colorful and realistic (especially the water), the movie takes us into a relatively unique world where dinosaurs have evolved into the dominant, civilized species and humans (from our limited perspective) are viewed as little more than pets. Where the movie excelled in the animation, it fell very much behind in plot, depth, originality, general appropriateness, and entertainment. Rather than really explore this potentially interesting world, the film keeps us focused on the simplistic farm-life of one family of Apatosauruses. In particular, the experiences of the protagonist, Arlo. This is a young character who, from the very start of the film, makes it clear that he is at odds with everything around him. He is timid, unsure of himself, yet sweet and eager to prove himself. While this character may connect with children, older audience members may find him quite un-relatable and therefore feel somewhat alienated from the story. To its credit, the film does offer some truly touching and sentimental moments between Arlo and his Poppa (adequately voiced by Jeffrey Wright). The lessons learned during these moments may provide some credibility to the overall experience, but are still not enough to sustain the entire story. The film doesn't seem to know where to place itself in its story-telling. This is evident from the fact that it borrows heavily from the more classic Disney heavyweights such as The Lion King and Bambi. There are many obvious similarities between them, hence the lack of originality. Furthermore, within this somewhat deconstructed story, there are a number of images that just don't seem to belong in an animated movie aimed for children: slightly strong, inappropriate violence towards visibly cute animals, the only human character behaving in a feral and primitive manner (not to mention wearing a leafy loincloth, introducing the concept of shame), and of course a scene where the main characters are actually tripping out and hallucinating on psychedelic berries, followed by a pretty obvious drug-induced hangover. Moreover, the film appears to come up short in the voice department. Frances McDormand's soothing voice as Momma is quite nice during the beginning of the movie, and Anna Paquin voicing a cowgirl T-Rex is funny at best. But the only real treat is hearing Sam Elliot's distinctive cowboy drawl expressing his words of wisdom, which lasts all to briefly. All in all, The Good Dinosaur is a cinematically beautiful and pleasant film to watch. It is a warm yet unoriginal coming-of-age tale set in a relatively original environment. Although the story had a lot of potential at its core, The Good Dinosaur is unable to stand firmly alongside the long list of accomplished works by its makers. Leaving the viewers expecting much more.","

"drqshadow-reviews","6 January 2016","A lesser Pixar effort that's still meaningful and effective, swapping the roles of man and beast in a creative, interesting turn. Its tone is a bit conflicted, though, with a plot that's clearly aimed at younger audiences but several distressing scares and a harsh edge that might make it difficult for children to swallow. Thankfully, it's got a big heart, and an unexpectedly sharp sense of humor that often left me chuckling alongside my two young sons, so those frights were almost always immediately diffused. I didn't care for the overly-simplistic character designs, which call back to the stop-motion history of dinosaurs on film, but the landscapes are appropriately stunning and the big effects work is top-of-the-line. These guys know how to press their audience's buttons and provoke a visceral reaction, even in the midst a disastrous production with major seismic shifts behind the scenes. It's a good adventure flick, deep and expansive, with a nice message and a strong character arc, but there's still something missing. Again, I'd place it among Pixar's weaker films, but in that cellar it keeps fairly good company.","

"darrenrmuller","27 December 2015","Concerning the SanJay's Super Team bundling with the Good Dinosaur. As parents we are careful to consider the content of the movies that our Children are exposed to. I strongly object to how parents have no warning about what their children are about to be subjected to. I do not consent to my young children's mind being infiltrated with false gods and frightening imagery. My wife had to leave the cinema as our soon to be 2 year old daughter was distressed (as were we!!). My 4 year old son buried his head into the chair as I covered his eyes and tried to protect him from the disturbing voices and images. This is completely unacceptable to take away the rights of the parents. The 'feature' was clearly slipped in just before the movies appearing to be the start of the actual movie we wanted to see. My wife looked at me in shock with what was being portrayed and asked is this part of the movie. Clearly trickery to get people guard down and seize the opportunity of a captive audience. I was uncomfortable with the aggressive attempt to force my children to accept this as cool and somehow relevant to them. It is not and if this was in the movie we paid to see we would have simply walked out. Very concerned about these practices! How dare they?!! I can't fathom how this is okay?!! It seems to be to the point where we can't trust our own screening through watching previews.","

However, I would say the ending is quickly wrapped up, I loved watching it! I didn't feel it was slow moving at all- but I'm a 30 something. Funny and beautiful graphics (worth that alone). Definitely worth seeing and buying. It definitely is good for both children and adults. I think this movie didn't do as well due to being released at an unfortunate time, however my family loved it. Laughs and tears. I'd say it is up there with Up, Toy Story, and pretty much every other Pixar film. Great movie, great Dinos!","

"mattangley","2 April 2022","I know it's a Pixar film but it falls far short of expectations for a Pixar film. It's slow, boring, and misses the mark in. Even the name is misleading. You think Arlo is going to be some kind of angel that sets him apart from other characters in the movie. But it's really just about a scrawny, cowardly dinosaur that gets lost and tries to find his way home with the help of a came kid who acts more like a dog than a human. It's a weird film. The story is weak, there is hardly any character development, and a surprisingly little amount of dialogue to keep kids interested. My 5yo got up and started playing with toys about 30 minutes in. I feel like Pixar knew it was a bad film but they had already invested so much they had to finish the project. I'd save yourself time and just watch The Land Before Time, which is what I'm pretty sure this movie is trying to rip off of. This is definitely Pixar's worst film to date.","

"Animany94","22 September 2019","Inside Out was an amazing film and a tough act to follow even for Pixar whose films almost non-stop were instant classics with a few exceptions like Cars and its sequels, Brave and to a certain extent A Bug's Life. But this is also the lowest grossing of their works to date with only 332 mio. dollars globally.Not that the film is terrible, because it has its strong elements like the gorgeous background animation which shows a grand scale and photorealistic landscapes even if it's not anything special for a dinosaur movie. But that sadly leads us into one of the odd choices of the movie, because the cartoony style characters feel rather misplaced in these realistic surroundings and that works against itself.And sadly, that's not the only problem, because the studio that sparked our imagination with what toys could do when we didn't watch or what could be behind monsters hiding in closets set up this intruiging premise for this film about what the world would look like if they hadn't gone extinct, but spent so little time on it and gave a rather predictable coming-of-age story.Arlo is a dinosaur kid who is filled with fear and can't do what it takes to make his family proud, but one day he discovers a cave boy who ends up turning his life upside down when he gets seperated from his family and must survive on his way home. The bond they build is the strongest part of the movie, because of their similar goals and watching them travel together. They meet a colourful cast of characters who, yet again, are not given much screen time to be more than either an obstacle or a helper. That's sad, because they could hev been really entertaining or even more in the rather by-the-book story.Yes, this is not a ""Pixar-good"" film, but okay for casual viewing.","

"Skellons2-211-170992","11 April 2016","We are far too quick to judge things bad because they don't fit into a bracket we have created in our heads. All of the negative reviews of this film have centred around the 'Pixar make movies which do this and have this format' - wake up people...this is a beautifully shot film with a heart felt story that my four year old loves.Alongside covering the issue of loss of a loved one (Bambi, UP!) this films teaches that we can all overcome differences and be tolerant with those who don't fit our upbringing or morals/belief structure. The relationship between the two main characters is heartwarming and amusing as they move through their life journey together.Those people who are upset it doesn't have 'songs my three year old can sing' or fit the bracket of 'nice' Pixar films probably need to re watch this without their 'my child must be protected from the world' glasses on.","

"flavia_cj","5 April 2016","First of all, Arlo is the worst protagonist I have ever seen in an animated film. His design is uninspired, he's dull and boring. His fears are annoying rather than instil empathy. Spot is cute, but only one character isn't able to sustain a long animation.The world of ""The Good Dinosaur"" is dull and sparse. I mean, the premise is: ""What would happen if the asteroid had not hit the Earth?"" The animators had a great idea to explore, but in the end, we see very few dinosaurs in story, and dinosaurs living in isolation from each other. All this reinforces the idea of ​​a very sterile world. Dinosaurs also just copy the human lifestyle. Really? For a studio that created Toy Story, the writers and animators could have had more creativity, originality and daring.And someone please explain to me what the hell are these cartoon- dinosaurs with extremely realistic scenarios in the background? Yes, the scenery is magnificent, but it just doesn't match the look and design of the dinosaurs.""Cars 1 and 2"" are bad, but they ensure fun for kids and have some memorable characters - ""The Good Dinosaur"" isn't fun, nor is memorable. ""Brave"" also had a lame history, but the protagonist Merida was incredible and unforgettable, both in design and in attitudes - Arlo is simply a dull character and lacking charisma. Then yes, I really think ""The Good Dinosaur"" is the worst movie Pixar so far.","

"meydiana-65242","5 December 2020","Pixar Continues To Tug at Heartstrings. Don't Get the Bad Reviews AT ALL.I'm in my twenties and to be honest, I still enjoy watching Pixar films with my family. There's just something so genuine and beautiful about their movies, not to mention the endless amount of lessons one can learn.When I initially read the reviews about ""The Good Dinosaur"", they were all so bad. It didn't stop me from watching though and I do not regret that decision. This has got to be one of the most heartwarming Pixar films I've ever seen and it tugged at my heartstrings. I was crying throughout the movie especially towards the end.The thing about being an adult, we tend to overthink something so simple. The plot isn't something grand. It's not funny. It's cute. If you're looking for a film like the classic Pixar favorite ""Toy Story"", forget about watching this. It's a really simple storyline that focuses mainly on teaching the importance of family, dealing with fears and overcoming them as well as finding oneself or making your mark in this world. View ""The Good Dinosaur"" with an open mind and just be ready to enjoy the movie without reading too much between the lines. The good thing about Pixar films is that they remind you how wonderful it is to still be a kid at heart. This movie is no exception. In fact, I think this joins the ranks of ""Finding Nemo"",""UP"", and ""Inside Out"". Everyone has a right to their own opinion, but I can't help but wonder why majority just plain dislike this movie.If you're on the fence after reading one too many 1-star reviews, I say go ahead and still watch it. Judge for yourself. Be pure hearted like a kid and try to embrace the beautiful lessons of the film. Allow it to engulf you and touch you. If you have a kid/kids, this would be one of those perfect films to have a hearty conversation with afterwards. It's very inspiring, really.Give ""The Good Dinosaur"" a try. Oh and one more thing, don't be afraid to cry while watching this. I've seen this twice and still end up a mess every time.","

"redtownergm","23 December 2015","Why I watched this one? Come on.....this is a Pixar movie....and I have a 6 and 9 year old....was it possible for me not to see this movie? What is this one about? In a world where dinosaurs and humans live side-by-side, an Apatosaurus named Arlo makes an unlikely human friend.My thoughts on this one? DO NOT TAKE SMALL CHILDREN TO THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!! Yesterday my 6 year old had another 6 year old over for a sleepover. We thought it would be a good idea to take them to the latest Pixar movie...The Good Dinosaur. The 6 year olds survived the first tragic movie event pretty well....even at 6 they know that parents have a short shelf life in Disney movies. When they saw a creature get it's head ripped off and eaten they started to squirm. When they saw a cute furry little creature get saved, then eaten alive, and then watched some other creatures fight over the remains of the carcass they started asking when the movie was going to be over. When they watched our two heroes get stoned from eating some rotten fruit they were just confused. When they heard a story about how a T-Rex killed a raptor by drowning the raptor in the T-Rex's BLOOD (spoken in the best deepest Sam Elliott voice)...they were ready to go.So when the movie was gearing up for the relentless violent finale..they both had enough. In tears they wanted to leave the theater. On the way out the door they were joined by two more small crying children. On the way into the theater my oldest daughter (she's 21) and I saw a poster for Krampus...we joking said...""We should take them to that movie""....turns out that is what we did! This movie has been promoted as a great family movie...maybe for the Manson family....but not for my family! Last night my wife and I felt so bad that we took another parent's kid to this movie. Is this what Pixar was shooting for? A movie that would scare the hell out of kids....well if that was their goal....then they accomplished it with flying colors.Final thought: As for a review...the animation is excellent, the story is pretty plain, the characters are not very likable....though Spot was easily the best character. Pre-teens might like this movie....but kids younger than 9 should not see this movie...wait until it is on DVD.Ranked 38th of 41 movies on my Pixar vs DreamWorks Movie Ranking Page. www.ultimatemovierankings.com/pixar-movies-vs-dreamworks-movies/","

"leosmith-11166","25 December 2015","What can I say. I am dumbfounded. The Animation in this film is so awesome and lifelike, it's kind of creepy. The Mountains, The Rivers and the Trees are so well animated that it will twist your mind. The Story was great, but I heard complaints that it was to basic and slow. Well yes, the story is basic, but that's why it's so good. The films target audience is younger children, not 40 year olds. I agree that it was not even near as great as Inside Out, which was complex, charming and humorous. But Inside Out probably appealed more to adults and nostalgia Pixar lovers( me included), but it wasn't as big of a hit with the kids, due to the complex storyline. So with The Good Dinosaur, they tried to make a film that will make kids laugh and appeal to their minds. Even for an adult, the Good Dinosaur still has its emotional and humorous moments, and it has some really good messages that kids can understand. I know that it is no where near as great as Toy Story, Monsters Inc, Up or Inside Out, but it is still a very beautiful and magical film. Pixar once again deliver.","

I honestly don't understand what's people beef with this? If anything, this movie has got to be one of the most touching animated movies I have seen. There's a strong friendship built here, and we see this friendship bloom gradually. I cried watching this. And no, I'm not a kid anymore. This movie is very predictable and cliché-ish, nothing new. But this movie brings out the kid in us where we adore cute dinosaurs, cute kids, life in the forest, the flow of the river, etc. Arlo, the ""weakling"" Dinosaur, and the friendship he shared with Spot was very heartwarming that even adults can cry with this. I can never question the graphics because its Pixar. And they succeeded this time in making another touching movie. Its a one-of- a-kind journey of a dinosaur who faces his fears and realizes what real unconditional love is.","

I felt the weakest part of the film was the writing. I felt that Arlo, the good dinosaur, had a sad life. His relationship with the human critter was sweet and kind. I felt that the film could have been happier at times. I loved Sam Elliott who was the voice of Buzz, a fellow dinosaur. The other celebrity voices include Frances McDormand as Arlo's mother. The visual animation is first rate and high quality as only Pixar can provide today. It's a fine family film with some minor flaws. You can't help but feel for Arlo at times. I enjoyed the visual effects and animation with regards to the water scenes. When Arlo rescues his friend from large vulture creatures and the storm, it's quite an adventure. The film will be very popular among younger audiences especially.","

"Riley-H","15 April 2016","From my personal point of view, though the film is not the best one Pixar has produced, it was made with great effort. I've heard the hardship Pixar has overcome making up the plot and creating the delicate scenery. The story is not very complicated, but there are still several touching moments which made us all weep.The central meaning the film want to convey is as simple as bravery, family and friendship, which is very easy to understand. However, once accompanied by the beautiful environment and the background music, these simple concepts can get into our hearts really deep to let us feel, to identify with. I've heard from other reviews that some parents are not so satisfied to see their children cry while watching. But I don't think we can judge a film's quality simply by asking ""Is it amusing?"" As the previous Pixar film ""Inside Out"" pointed out, it's okay to feel sad. While a smile can only last a few seconds, some deep meanings in a film can be tasted over and over. The spirit of The Good Dinosaur does last in our mind.I'm a student as well as a film lover from China. I love it. My parents love it. My friends at school love it. And we all think there's a lot to learn from every Pixar film including this one.(Sorry about the grammatical mistakes this preview may contain. I am just an English learner.)","

"zetes","5 January 2016","Most definitely minor Pixar, but not bad Pixar (to date only Cars 2 qualifies as bad Pixar). It took me a while to get over my biggest gripe with the film, which is that the sauropod family at the center of the film represents, by far, the worst character design Pixar has ever come up with (and I'd be hard pressed to come up with any other uglier or blander animated characters in recent animated cinema). It doesn't help that the script is so straightforward, and I didn't immediately latch onto these characters. It does help that everything else in the film is gorgeous, and eventually the master/pet relationship between the protagonist, Arlo (Raymond Ochoa), and the human boy, Spot (Jack Bright), caught me. The story is simply that Arlo gets lost and must find his way home. There is a good message about overcoming one's fears. By the end, The Good Dinosaur becomes surprisingly involving. It's worth a watch if you're a fan.","

"umme4uke","18 January 2016","Just have to say, I've read a few reviews and it seems like people missed the point of this film entirely.Now, I'm not saying it's Pixar's best - far from it. But when you have animated flicks like Nemo, Toy Story 3 and Inside Out under your belt, it's hard to keep topping yourself. Yet the Good Dinosaur is not all bad and does tell a story, with a message, which I think has been overlooked.This film is about being the better person by forgiving and reaching out to the enemy. The little dino's dad said he was him and then some - the some was being able to befriend the human even though they had nothing in common.The dinosaurs were supposed to be us - and the humans were supposed to be either those humans we don't trust, or animals we don't trust, it doesn't really matter. The point was to give small children the moral message of bravery through understanding, forgiveness and being able to let go - perhaps a little deep but it is what it is.The other thing this film is is an awards tech demo. The scenery graphics were probably the best rendered on a computer yet.I won't deny that this was an uneven Pixar entry but I don't think it's as bad as some of the negativity applied to it.It was no more scary or violent than Lion King. Dad killed by nature - check. Wounded protagonist - check. Eating bugs - check. The difference is that the natural effects, like dangerous weather, were so well rendered that a child could find them disturbing.","

"dave-mcclain","29 November 2015","""In a world where dinosaurs never became extinct"" would be an appropriate opening phrase for the trailer promoting the Pixar-animated, Disney-distributed adventure comedy ""The Good Dinosaur"" (PG, 1:40). Most scientists believe that 65 million years ago (give or take a million years or so) a meteor struck the earth, changing its climate so dramatically that dinosaurs became extinct. (For more on that, check out Charlton Heston's opening narration to 1998's ""Armageddon""... or Wikipedia.) If that meteor, whose collision with earth seems so random, had somehow randomly missed the earth, dinosaurs would've likely maintained their dominance over our planet. It also stands to reason that they would have continued to evolve. Just maybe the herbivores would've become farmers and the carnivores, ranchers. Other species would have evolved too, and mankind could've appeared on the scene, but probably wouldn't have dominated the huge reptiles. That's the world in which this film immerses us.Meet the Apatosaurus family. They're large, green and have long tails and very long necks, which they use to push their snouts through the dirt to make furrows where they scatter corn seeds. Poppa Henry (Jeffrey Wright) and Momma Ida (Frances McDormand) work hard, and they're about to get some help. The couple is happily awaiting the hatching of their three eggs. Within moments of each other emerge Buck (Ryan Teeple / Marcus Scribner), Libby (Maleah Padilla) and the under-sized, overly-anxious Arlo (Jack McGraw / Raymond Ochoa). As the three young dinosaurs grow, Buck and Libby become useful members of this farm family, each rewarded for their labors with an opportunity to place a muddy footprint on one of the rocks that make up the family's corn silo. Arlo, on the other hand, tries hard, but is either too scared or to too clumsy to accomplish much and longs for his chance to ""make his mark"".Poppa does what he can to help little Arlo, but he knows that, eventually, Arlo's going to have to accomplish something on his own. Poppa gives Arlo the job of trapping and killing ""the critter"" which has been stealing corn out of the silo. The creature that springs the trap turns out to be a feral young caveboy who grunts and moves around on all fours. To Arlo, this is just an animal who steals the family's corn reserves, but he still can't bring himself to kill the critter. When Poppa finds out that the critter got away, he and Arlo give chase, but a sudden storm keeps father and son from catching the little guy. Arlo comes to blame the critter for everything that's wrong in his life. The next time the kid shows up, Arlo angrily chases after him, only to fall into the river, hit his head on a rock, get swept downstream and awake to find himself alone, scared and far from home – with no recognizable landmarks in sight.The rest of the movie involves Arlo's attempts to find his way home – before he is done in by the forces of nature or the predators that surround him. ""The critter"", which Arlo names ""Spot"", joins Arlo on his journey and the two end up friends, helpers and protectors for each other. On this journey, the pair encounter a Styracosaurus oracle / animal whisperer named Forrest Woodbush (Peter Sohn), a group of viciously predatory pterodactyls, led by Thunderclap (Steve Zahn), a family of Tyrannosaurus ranchers headed by Butch (Sam Elliott), and a gang of cattle rustling Velociraptors which includes a dinosaur named Earl (John Ratzenberger). Between the wild animals and the similarly violent and unpredictable storms on this alternate version of earth, Arlo and Spot making it back to Arlo's farm is far from certain.""The Good Dinosaur"" has much to recommend it to families and fans of animated movies, but lacks the inspiration that makes the difference between good and great family fare. (Revealingly, the film involved a mid-production change of directors and several postponements of its release date.) The story is original and fun to watch, but doesn't really have much to say. At times, you may even wonder what this is you're watching and why, but a couple magical scenes involving fireflies and the movie's spectacular computer animation (especially the scenes involving water) help hold the attention of kids and adults alike. The script is strong but not what I'd call special, and contains a mildly amusing, but rather odd scene of Arlo and Spot eating berries that make them hallucinate. The voice work is solid, even with an unusually large proportion of little-known actors in the oft-changed cast. This movie is entertaining enough to be worth a look, but has problems that make the adjective in the title more descriptive than the filmmakers probably intended. This Pixar/Disney release isn't great, but it is pretty good. ""B""","

"lgerbick","19 February 2016","On a whim, I took my 2.5 year old son to see this movie at a newly refurbished cinema in town, more to support local business and occupy our February vacation. I did not read reviews, but my son likes dinosaurs and we saw a trailer for it before Mickey Mouse Clubhouse so I figured it would be OK. He had seen Inside Out in theaters and loved it so I felt like this would be a fun rainy afternoon.The short beforehand was quite loud and scary. I appreciate that it showed a different culture and the story was sweet, but it was a bit intense. The feature followed suit. Even the parts that were supposed to be funny (like the chickens and hallucinogenic berries) were just bizarre and upsetting. The only time my son giggled was during the groundhog scene and he oooed and ahhhed at the fireflies. Otherwise, he did not enjoy it and spent most of the time nuzzled in my chest.Thankfully, the most disturbing parts went over his head, but another mom and I kept looking at each other like ""Is this happening?"" From the weird triceratops to the violent bug beheading to the flashbacks to a traumatic death to the terrifying pterodactyl Evangelists (which I found more than mildly offensive as a saved Christian) to the constant peril, I was just as uncomfortable as my son. I am glad we only paid $5 because I would've felt quite ripped off if we paid full price. Needless to say we will not be adding this one to our DVD library.","

"MisterAwesome","4 December 2015","First, let me mention that it being an animation movie doesn't necessarily mean that it is a children's movie. It's got some scary pieces and may not be suitable for everyone. That being said, in my humble opinion, this movie is really great! Sure, it's story isn't really original and might be a bit cheesy, but it is really well done. The characters are lovable and do evolve during the story and teach us some very meaningful life lessons in a very playful manner. The visuals are by far the best I've ever seen in any animated movie. Sometimes it was hard to tell if it was real world footage or animated. The art of animation has come a long way since the first Toy Story. The score was very jolly and uplifting and at moments very touching when it needed to be. The voice acting was excellent as expected. The movie has some similarities with the Lion King and Brother Bear and in the end, really touched me.It definitely isn't Pixar's best, neither is it it's worst. Coming after Inside Out, which set the bar extremely high, it leaves people disappointed for obvious reasons. Try to look at this as a movie apart, without comparing it to other Pixar movies which are incomparable. Go see it in the cinema with an open mind and enjoy the fun, emotional and visual feast of The Good Dinosaur.","

"raywrod","29 November 2015","Life is a cruel and merciless hell and you are lucky just to survive. I am not describing the theme of an existentialist French art flick, but of Disney/Pixar's ""The Good Dinosaur,"" which imagines a dystopic alter-verse in which dinosaurs have evolved to the level of eighteenth century farmers and ranchers and humans occupy the dog-like status we so richly deserve. The plot revolves around a pitifully under-endowed brontosaurus runt who is nevertheless pressured by his well intentioned parents into making his mark on the world. The result is a Job-like barrage of unprovoked attacks and misfortunes that seem designed, much like the 21st century American economy, to convince your children that they should never leave home. My son, who watched most of the movie through his fingers while sitting in his mother's lap, spent much of dinner that night asking about death. Thanks, Disney, for another night of QT with the family!","

"nogodnomasters","5 July 2018","The film starts off with a comical meteor head fake which gave me a chuckle as the movie starts out being funny on two levels. Unfortunately that was my last real laugh. This was the age when talking dinosaurs with knowledge of agriculture and architecture lived with feral humans. Think Dino and the Flintstones in role reversals. Arlo is the runt of his siblings wanting to make his mark. He is tasked with killing the varmint eating their corn...a human. Oh yes they live in temperate zone America...or so it seems. He is a scared Brontosaurus type who is awkward and has trouble killing the human, eventually named Spot, who acts like a dog. The film didn't turn interesting again until Sam Elliot enters the scene, but by then it was too little too late.I am sure the younger kids will like it while older ones may crave something else. It is something for family night.","

"virginiatilley","18 December 2021","I don't understand the negative reviews of this movie. I thought it was a lovely, moving film, with a plot that was even surprising, and an unusual story of characters finding each other in a wonderfully creative imaginary landscape. It's even bold in some places. (Where do we have hallucinatory drugs and a bug's head being ripped off in a children's flick?) The conceptual rendering of the imagined world of an early dinosaur civilization, that developed millions of years after the famous asteroid did not hit Earth, was fun and engaging. So what if it had some logical glips that strained the concept? Many highly rated fantasy movies have worse.As to not connecting emotionally, a common complaint of critics, they must brought strangely hard hearts to this film. A lot of reviewers have said they teared up over some scenes and so did I. It's a lovely coming-of-age tale. It helps also that the score is absolutely delightful. (The sound track in general - wind, thunder, crackling fire - is detailed and realistic.)Whether or not you're engaged by the story, the animation is simply jaw-dropping and not to be missed. This Pixar at its most brilliant, doing miraculous things it's never done before or since. Leaves quiver; dew drops sparkle; river currents swirl; grasses sway gently in the breeze. The more you look the more you see.Truly the only downside is the strange decision to depict the dinosaurs as green blow-up balloons, who, because of the naturalistic world around them, seem strangely disconnected from their environment. The lost opportunities there, for cool renderings of these fictional beings, are sad. I'm guessing this was either a marketing decision (easier to reproduce for merchandising) or just a holdover from an earlier stage in the production when the artistic aims weren't so very high.I feel sorry for those at Pixar who poured such loving care and wonderful talent into this film only to suffer such grim production problems and ultimately such dismal reviews. It's well worth watching and, for the superb artistry if nothing else, even a must-see.","

"ollievr","17 June 2016","I have little understanding of how anyone could give this movie a poor review. It may lack in outright humor that many expect in animated features, but its a coming of age story whose touch can be felt by viewers of all ages. Throughout, my heartstrings were being strummed by what felt like some kind of hair metal band. I think only Elly's death in Up! has made me cry harder. This one will stand the test of time to hang around with the rest of the all time greats. The animation is spot on and being that it's not set in any known version of the world, it allows the story to be the driving force of the film. It's a wonderful story too, following traditions, faithfulness to family, facing challenges, making friends, cooperation, loyalty, loss, courage, sacrifice, and in general love. That's a lot for one film to convey and it pulls it off so well. If you haven't seen this film yet, you're really missing out on something special. Pixar at its best.","

"Quietb-1","27 November 2015","Pixer does it again, another animated feature that will be enjoyed by the whole family. The Good Dinosaur"" is Arlo. An alternate title would be ""Arlo Develops Life Skills"". It is almost a dinosaur western.Great visuals, a simple story and the stressing of the value of family come together perfectly. There is humor and plenty of action. Some things may be too intense for younger children. The only thing missing was a song. The movie looks great on the big screen. Take the family to the theater. Following the theatrical run, the kids will watch it over and over on a home platform .","

"MartianOctocretr5","28 March 2016","What if that infamous asteroid of 66 million years ago zoomed right on by this planet on into space? What if that K-T extinction event never took place? What if dinosaurs were still around; would they still dominate the world?This movie could have had some greater fun with such a premise, but sacrifices creativity for time-worn animated movie clichés. The hero and his family are just a human family in dinosaur bodies, and don't shine any exposition on this modified Earth. Humans? Yes, they're here but developing slowly. They are primitive quadrupeds that can, but rarely bother to, walk as bi-peds.The story is just a perils of Pauline type thing, with predators and other natural disasters afflicting the heroes every so often. Oh, and humans act like dogs in this world, for whatever reason. Some characters die grotesque deaths at random times, just not a pleasant story. In the end, not much is accomplished, so all these deaths are for nothing, just like the story.Could have been a lot better; not sure why they settled for this.","

"matejkaarnost","24 June 2016","Saw it today and from start was surprised how it could be that it is from Pixar. Studio which so far had really nice storytelling, logical and poetic when needed with love and great mixture of things for adults and for children. This . this is for neither. From children perspective it is sometimes cute, then you see things which would be straight nightmares, vulgarities and non-sense. ""Story"" itself is more likely a bunch of ideas put together with very thing main plot with one vision only – at least that's how it seems – make money. Adults may find it boring, heavy in the way that you need explain lot of things to your confused children afterwards and mainly in many cases you just watching when it ends and you can go.From Pixar I would expect way more, this is I think the worst movie I saw from them and am very glad this time I did not see it in cinema as this one is not worth the money / time involved. Let's hope this fiasco bring Pixar clarity and get them back to quality.","

"stevendbeard","28 November 2015","I saw ""The Good Dinosaur"", starring the voices of Jeffrey Wright-The Hunger Games:Mockingjay Part 1&2, Quantum of Solace; Frances McDormand- Moonrise Kingdom, Aeon Flux; Raymond Ochoa-Mars Needs Moms, A Christmas Carol_2009; Jack Bright-This is his second movie, with Monsters University being his first and Sam Elliott-Justified_tv, Ghost Rider.This is a Pixar animated movie that poses the question, 'What if the asteroid that struck the earth millions of years ago-supposedly killing all the dinosaurs-missed the earth?' The dinosaurs might have evolved into more civilized animals; some might begin farming and raising crops while others become ranchers, with herds of buffalo. Jeffrey is the father Apatosaurus of a family including 3 kids. Frances is his wife and Raymond is the youngest of his kids. Raymond is a little on the squeamish side; almost everything scares him. Jeffrey decides to take him out for a walk and try to toughen him up but something happens and Raymond gets lost. He soon comes across Jack, a human boy that likes to howl like a wolf. They eventually become friends and look out for each other. Jack is kind of like a dog-I mentioned he likes to howl-and Raymond even names him Spot. They also come across Sam, a Tyrannosaurus Rex that is one of those afore mentioned buffalo ranchers. The main theme of the movie is about Raymond overcoming his fears and becoming an adult. All in all, the movie was very entertaining, with a good story and great animation. There was also an animated short called 'Sanjay's Super Team' that preceded the movie. It was entertaining, as well. I think most kids should enjoy the movie but it might be a little intense for smaller ones, because of some of the dinosaur action. It's rated ""PG"" for some peril, action and thematic elements and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes. I enjoyed it and I think my grand kids would also like it and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.","

"Andybor","27 June 2017","I don't usually write reviews here but I felt compelled to make at least a short one for this movie.The Good Dinosaur is a simple movie. We follow the story of Arlo, an Apatosaurus who got separated from his family, and needs to find his way back home, while in the process meeting a small human child and he creates a bond with him. I personally think that was one of the movie's strongest points. The bond between this two characters was so sweet and entertaining that it kept me invested throughout the whole movie. And it made every emotional moment hit pretty hard, and oh boy... two scenes in particular were directed so well that I was almost tearing up, which caught me completely by surprise.The other strong point of the film is the landscape animation: it looks almost photo-realistic. Absolutely gorgeous stuff. I do admit that sometimes it clashes with the character animation, which is more cartoony, but that didn't really bother me that much.Ultimately, even though I understand some people's disappointment with the film considering it is different from some other Pixar movies, I strongly recommend to people that haven't seen it to give it a go. Just know what you are getting into. You are gonna watch a smaller scale, character focused, humble movie, that doesn't shine because of it's concept, but because of its execution.The movie starts kinda slow, but I would say after Arlo gets separated from its family, and for the rest of the movie, is where it really shines.Also, it definitely has some intense parts and it is definitely aimed towards both kids and adults. One scene in particular actually shocked me and caught me by surprise. It took me a couple of seconds to remember I was watching a Pixar movie.TL;DR - Try to watch the movie and make your own opinion. If you go with standard expectations, and you appreciate the movie for what it is, I can almost assure you, you will enjoy it.","

"callum-mccolgan","26 March 2018","There are two scenes in The Good Dinosaur which stand out for their brilliance. Both wordlessly capture the longing for family and home entirely through a series of simple gestures. It's a great shame then, that the rest of the film that surrounds these scenes is so muddled, cloying and mediocre by comparison.The visual aesthetic here is strange. The vistas and scenery are astoundingly beautiful and the film itself is a technical marvel. Yet the puffy character design looks like something one would find in a CBeebies cartoon, and is ill-fitting when the ground they walk on looks so lifelike.The unfocused nature of the visual design carries over to the story as well. Following a young dinosaur on this journey to get back to his family after being swept away in a storm, learning to bond with a young human boy on the way. The plot points are all rather predictable, which is no bad thing if the writing is strong and characters interesting. However, The Good Dinosaur meanders back and forth through various scenes with no apparent thematic connection to one another. An early standout moment involves the two companions eating dodgy fruit and going on a drug-induced acid trip. No, really.Otherwise, this film is a fairly sub-par re-telling of a well-known story that doesn't really warrant any further mention. The tone lurches back and forth between the cloying and the gruesome; the main characters just aren't very compelling; and the lack of real wit makes the dialogue tiresome to listen to. Were this a silent movie, there would be real potential for something unique and compelling. As it stands, The Good Dinosaur just a below-average Pixar movie.","

"Filvies144","9 August 2016","In 2015, after the spectacular Inside Out by Pixar, I was looking forward to this film that would mark the first time Pixar has ever released 2 films in the same year rather than one at a time. However, I did not see it in theaters but saw it on a plane in February along with Hotel Transylvania 2 (I never get tired of movies on a plane since they are free, have you ever been on one of those flights?). But that's not the point. So once I saw this movie, I could understand how critical people were of this movie.First things first, the writing is complete garbage. It doesn't give us any new ideas by ripping off The Lion king, with Arlo's dad dying. It is also fascinatingly predictable since we already know from the trailers what's ahead for Arlo and Spot. There is only a little heart, and you don't feel for the relationship between Arlo and Spot because the story is so rushed. Because of this, the journey is underwhelming and the lack of length and many slow moments makes the ending too sudden. A good example of a film that has good pacing is Inside Out, not making it too fast for the ending to be this sudden and not too slow to make it boring (some may disagree though). I expect better writing from Pixar because this horribly paced, predictable, unoriginal, and fascinatingly underwhelming story makes DreamWorks writing look like Finding Nemo.For the characters, there is Arlo, who probably has the least development of a Pixar protagonist. Despite making friends with Spot, I don't feel for this annoying, foolish, and enamoring kid. The father is basically the caring father who is bland and we don't care about him very much. The same apply's to the rest of Arlo's family pretty much. Spot however is a fun and likable character who cares for Arlo. Thunderclap and his gang are the bland antagonists who have no other motives other than attack and kill Arlo and Spot. However I did like the caring and friendly T-Rex family. They were very good characters that cared deeply for our 2 protagonists, however they were wasted since they get very little screen time. So these are basically Pixar's weakest characters since Cars 2.The animation in the movie is nothing short of spectacular. The backgrounds look awesome and believable, the sound is great, and the characters are well designed. The only problem is the inconsistency, with Spot looking realistic, and the dinosaurs looking very cartoony. But overall, Pixar is better than ever in terms of animation.There may be some things done right, but this is not Pixar. Despite Great animation, the movie has awful writing, and a weak cast of characters. I even consider it on par with Dreamworks projects due to this. That is saying a lot because I think Pixar is the best animation company, not DreamWorks animation. Despite intense scenes Kids 7-10 will likely get a kick out of this. If you are curious and is older than that age range, I would recommend skipping it and checking out Inside Out, or renting it for just one night if you are very curious. It may not be a total waste of time due to the animation and a few good characters, but it really misses my expectations.","

"ferguson-6","3 December 2015","Greetings again from the darkness. Two Pixar films in one year? Earlier this year, the brilliant Inside Out reminded us just what sets Pixar apart from other animation studios  the film was intelligent, insightful, thoughtful, beautiful, funny and emotional enough to bring tears to the eyes of many parents. In other words, it's a tough act to follow – even for Pixar! Of course, 2015 was not intended to be a double-header for Pixar. The Good Dinosaur ran into serious production and story issues at the same time the studio was going through layoffs and reorganization. So the six year project turned into eight, as a new creative team was brought in (led by director Peter Sohn), and the story and characters were re-worked and re-imagined. The finished product is likely the most staggeringly beautiful animation to ever hit the big screen, while at the same time being some of the darkest and bleakest material ever presented by Pixar.The premise is pretty interesting: What would Earth be like if THE asteroid had missed, and the dinosaurs survived? That's about as sciency as the story gets, other than it does portray nature as a colossal adversary. We first meet Momma and Poppa Apatosaurus as they work their corn fields (?) and wait for their baby eggs to hatch. The runt of the litter is Arlo, who just can't keep up with his more active siblings and who feels inadequate in comparison to his majestic father. Arlo and nature are responsible for the tragedy that sends Arlo off on a journey that features the full spectrum: the importance of family, the sadness of loss, the strength of friendship, and the self-discovery that leads to independence. While there are quite a few laughs along the way, the fear and isolation that Arlo experiences takes up most of the movie, and could leave all but the strongest kids feeling anything but upbeat and happy. There is a life lesson about making one's mark, and the oddball friendship between Arlo and young boy (named Spot??) who is wise to nature, but this one lacks the charm of most Pixar outings, while at the same time reaching technical levels that are breathtaking to behold. It's difficult to imagine many kids wanting to watch this one again and again, but for all you Pixar nerds, you can rest easy  John Ratzenberger does make a vocal appearance.","

"danielharden","26 June 2016","In 2015 we got some great animated movies (Inside Out) and some less than satisfying blatant cash grabs (The Minions Movie),and amongst the good and the bad we also got ""the meh"" with The Good Dinosaur. With a disastrous ""making of"" spanning 6 years, and then also becoming the forgotten cousin to Pixars other release that year Inside Out, things didn't go too well for this OK family adventure.This is a Disney Pixar film for sure. Why do I say this you ask? Well its because this film follows the Disney Pixar formula to the letter, and constantly copy's from their own back catalogue. The Dad dies like Mufasa in Lion King, the protagonist encounters 3 hostiles like Bruce's gang in Finding Nemo and Arlo has to let the feral boy Spot go like Andy and his toys in Toy Story 3. Don't even get me started on the journey-back-home story line. The film is more or less a homage to Pixar and Disney and is actually rather sweet despite its unoriginality.The films voice acting I must say was quite poor. Jeffery Wright as Arlo's father I found particularly bad due to how severely patronising he was as if he was voicing a movie for newborn children. The voice of Arlo I found quite irritating especially his shout/ scream, but this is probably due to how often he screams in the film (like seriously, we get it, he's a wimp). I must also note cameos from Anna Paquin, Steve Zahn and Sam Elliot were pretty cool.Overall, the Good Dinosaur is a smart thief. It steals from the best and so creates a sweet movie for families to watch. Sweet but unoriginal is how I would sum it up in short.Its an okay film but its not Inside Out, on a positive note it's no Minions movie either.","

"captainmike-michael","27 November 2015","Simple, straightforward and predictable, the second Pixar's production of the year might not be creative as usual, appear to be familiar and formulaic plot but overall still has no problem to become a holiday enjoyment of the young and the old one. The main part of the story sets between human and the dinosaur based on a reversed formula which the dinosaur talks; it is a smooth A to Z educational animation which is filled with a lot of positive values that intends to influence the young adults. Presented in colorful photorealistic sets, it is visually stunning and there are certainly some beautiful scenes without any single dialogue, which effectively works well just like Wall-E, together with satisfying scores from academy awards winner Mychael Danna (Life of Pi). The adventure of grow and learn, cherishing family bonding and appreciating the value of friendship are the three major elements of usual Pixar's trademark, not only adorable, charming and family-friendly, but also emotionally engaging at certain times that might challenge audiences tear holding power.Short Film: Sanjay's Super Team Similar to the film, strong family bonding element in between the father and son, effectively presented without dialogue (except final scene), strong culture element and creatively featuring Gods as superheroes warriors.","

You need to click on the user name to see if that person does more than one review!! You click on their name & you see they been a member for 1 or more years but only have 1 REVIEW. That means the review is a bogus review!! People that are involved with Hollywood create these fake accounts for the simple reason or hyping a movie or trying to bring a competitors movie down!! So just check the reviewer before considering that review as one you might want to go by!!
That being said, on to the movie. The story and meaning of this movie is good, but that's where the good parts of the movie end!! This is an animated film & a kids film but that does not change things up. Kids learn from movies like these & that's why Disney was once the best in children's entertainment. Once I said but not now!! This shows dinosaurs were very intelligent & humans were dogs!! As we have been told, dinosaurs had pea brains & were not intelligent, being why they went extinct!! This movie has them being the more superior beings on the planet. The humans, as I said before are portrayed as DOGS!! They are even referred to as, critters in this movie!! Why I say dogs, the human boy walks on all fours like a dog!! Uses the bathroom like a dog!! Barks & growls like a dog!! Fetched like a dog!! Sleeps in every way like a dog!! Scratches himself just like a dog!! Even has a name fit for a dog, Spot!!! As we know, humans were not like that!! Aka, we did not evolve from apes or dogs!!! With the human being portrayed like that, tell me how then did he know or have the ability to make and wear a leaf pair of shorts? Then when you finally see other humans, they are standing up right, but still walk like dogs and howl!! They only walk at the end when they get the little boy!! You mean they got some intelligence that fast, wow!!! One more thing, when it rains a good storm, mountain sides full of LIVING trees turn into a landslide in the blink of an eye!! Making the river rise rapidly and form a huge waterfall!! At the other end of that waterfall, the water is CALM, lol!!! I don't recommend this movie for children at all!!

"lalybehappy","16 November 2017","This movie is about visuals. They put a lot of effort into showing the beauty of nature. They did a great job in that, the landscapes looked real, as though they went out into the fields and filmed it directly. But it's a flat story. I was unsatisfied by many of the interactions, especially at the end: the reactions were not natural, as though they didn't have time to add some feeling and movement to it other than smiling faces. Except there was actually plenty of space for it, they just didn't use it.The highlight of the movie for me was the portrayal of little critters, the worms, the bugs, and the dog-like behavior of the kid, those were done adorably! (Aka, the highlight was a side aspect of the movie.)The next best part were the lessons they made. Face your fears instead of running away from them. Work to earn your mark. Help others as others have helped you like a good Samaritan. Value your nuclear family. (But that's about it.) It felt as though the movie was mostly centered on the dangers of the moment. You can learn the lesson of facing your fears in their short ""Piper"" much better and in much less time than in this movie.All in all, it's not a bad movie, especially because it's aimed at kids, but I think kids are smart enough and strong enough that they can take Wall-E or even Leon the Professional, without a problem, those are nourishing films; basically, don't expect this to be anything more than something to pass time.I'm sad to give a mediocre review of a Pixar movie (also was skeptical about them joining Disney) but I'm hoping it's just the result of it being more of a Disney production than a Disney-Pixar one.","

"taryllsbaker","4 December 2015","The Good Dinosaur is Peter Sohn's directional-feature debut after his work on Pixar's short film 'Partly Cloudy (2009)' and stars Jeffrey Wright, Frances McDormand, Ramond Ochoa & Jack Bright.Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed free before an asteroid struck and changed the earth forever. This film tells a story that asks the question: What if the asteroid missed our planet completely? A young apatosaurus named Arlo becomes unlikely friends with a human and sets off on an adventure through a beautiful landscape with challenges and lessons along the way...It's safe to say, DisneyPixar are back from their slow and less-quality driven years of 2011-2014. With Inside Out and The Good Dinosaur being major successes, they have put themselves back on the radar.This film is stunning. The animators have really put in the time and effort to create these wonderful scenes and bring beautiful landscapes to life. The artwork is incredible. So much colour and life in every single shot, you find yourself asking: ""is this is animation or is this real?"" It's expertly crafted and so much emotion is poured on to the screen.The performances throughout by all of the cast, highlighting Raymond Ochoa and Jeffrey Wright as the leads, are outstanding. Convincing, dramatic and full of heart. It's feels so good when actors can portray feelings through just their voice, leaving it to the animators to depict their expressions. The original music by Mychael & Jeff Danna is an underscore of hope, sacrifice, love and friendship that carries the film through its deep and carefully thought-out screenplay. Using an array of instruments not so commonly heard in film scoring anymore, the Danna brothers have put together one of the best motion picture soundtracks this year. Go and see this film in cinemas. It truly deserves all of the money and support it can get. Huge thanks to the hard-working individuals that make these films so special to watch. Without you, I wouldn't be the same person I am today. I've grown up watching your work develop and evolve into these gigantic productions and it's always a pleasure to feel like I take something away each time.My verdict; The Good Dinosaur lets us know that anyone has it in them to face the hardest of challenges to succeed. The animation is incredible, and the story is touching. I'm still amazed that Pixar have the talent and skill to create these characters completely using computer technology, and still make us feel so much for them. Over and over again. The Good Dinosaur, 10/10.","

When the meteorite which was supposed to collide the mother earth but bypasses the planet and the dinosaur races still reigns the earth and develops a civilization. The story is about a young dinosaur named Arlo who lost his way back home befriends a human boy and they continues their adventurous journey together. The theme is new and animation is good. But the story is a mix mashup of previous animation movies like jungle book, croods, etc. the movie is interesting in parts and yawnful in the other areas. The kid looked cute. And the ending note was good. All total a just above average movie but its watchable for its joyful moments. I will vote 6 on 10","

"Hellmant","23 December 2015","'THE GOOD DINOSAUR': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new computer-animated comedy-adventure flick, from Pixar Studios; about an alternate world, where dinosaurs rule the land. It revolves around a young outcast Apatosaurus, who befriends a feral human boy. The movie was directed, and co-written, by first time feature filmmaker Peter Sohn. It features the voice talents of Raymond Ochoa, Jack Bright, Sam Elliott, Anna Paquin, A. J. Buckley, Jeffrey Wright, Frances McDormand and Steve Zahn. The movie (surprisingly) is Pixar's first failure at the Box Office, and it's only gotten mixed (to slightly positive) reviews from critics. It's a good flick, but it doesn't quite live up to what I've come to expect from Pixar. The film is set 65 million years after an asteroid, that caused the extinction of dinosaurs in our world, passes by earth. Dinosaurs are now the most advanced, and dominant, life-form (on the planet); and humans are wild animals. The story deals with a runt Apatosaurus, named Arlo (Ochoa), who befriends a human caveboy, he was supposed to kill, named Spot (Bright); after they both fall into a river, and are swept far away from home. The two bond, as they struggle to find their way back to their families.The movie is somewhat fun, and slightly emotional. I like dinosaurs (as do most kids) and I like the concept for this film; but it still feels like a bit of a mess. The animation is kind of sloppy, and unappealing, and the script just isn't very well thought out. The film doesn't feel touching, or special, the way that most Pixar movies do. It's still decently made though, compared to regular Disney animated flicks; it just doesn't live up to Pixar's standards!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/HX4VW0mIkCc","

"TxMike","25 August 2016","My wife and I saw this at home on BluRay from our public library. We found it interesting and inventive and enjoyed it very much. The animation gives a real personality to the animal characters, and the voice acting is first-rate.I had almost quit watching animated movies, so many of them have gotten so silly and frankly dull. So I only took this one home because it is on BluRay and with a hi-def TV and a surround sound system with powered subwoofer I figured it would be worthwhile. And it exceeded my expectations, it has a great sound track.The story starts off cleverly, we see a large ring of asteroids in space, one of them bumps another and it heads to Earth a few billion years ago. The asteroid that hit the Earth and is given credit for extinction of the dinosaurs. But this is a different take, the asteroid whizzes harmlessly by, and the story that ensues is ""What if the asteroid did not hit and cause the demise of dinosaurs?""So what we get is a focus on a dinosaur family, they actually farm high plains land in Wyoming with the mountains as a backdrop. And of course they speak English very well. The drama starts when dad and son, Arlo, are out on an expedition when a flash flood sweeps dad away right after he pushed Arlo up the ravine to safety. As Arlo learns to deal without a dad he has another encounter, what appears to be a small boy who does not speak and still walks (and runs!) on all fours. At first they are enemies but soon become friends. Later they encounter a family of T-Rex dinosaurs and help them round up their lost cattle.Any word description of the story will fail miserably, it cannot capture the fun of watching these fictional prehistoric characters deal with their world.","

"reid-91591","12 February 2016","All I can say is, who hurt the writers? Like what kind of sick, messed up childhood did they have? I'm 16 and I was terrified. I feel like this is worse than all the paranormal activities and Friday the 13ths combined. it was a stressful week so my family and I just wanted to watch something cute and sweet and so we decided on the Good Dinosaur. The trailer was sweet, Of Monsters and Men was playing in the background, and the animation was stunning. We started it, it was nice... At first. It went from 0 to five million in 2.5 seconds. It just got BRUTAL. But my family kept thinking, ""oh it'll get better"". It does not get better. It gets worse. So much worse. The end was nice, but just... I don't know how to explain it. I'd like to say that it was a sweet movie with dark undertones, but in reality it was a dark movie with dark overtones. Yes, I meant to say ""dark movie with dark overtones"". I'll admit, my family laughed at the dark parts, but we're all over the age of ten and it was the kind of laugh that students give out when they say that they just want to stand in the bus loop and wait until they get hit because there was a presentation or test or other unpleasant things that day. Don't waste your money on this unless you are emo and like pain or death and dying. If you are evil and want to mess up your kids, this is the movie. No need for the ""Himan Centipede"" the ""Good"" Dinosour will suffice. Needless to say I, a 16 year old girl who enjoys dark shows, will have nightmares. At least the scenery in them will be nice..","

"badoli","21 September 2017","That was a lame movie. Sure, it was masterfully done, but the characters are just cookie-cutter Disney. The only kinda creative move was the turnaround with the human being the ""pet"", everything else is Pixar-untypical bland.Something just rubs me the wrong way when i see dinosaurs being overly humanized. Several movies messed that up, most famously ""Dinosaurs"" in 2000. While we had humanized animals forever in cartoons, having cartoon T-Rex placed peacefully alongside herbivore dinos in a super-realistic world with all kinds of American accents, planting crops and herding cattle, is overkill for my taste. As characters they have nothing in common with dinosaurs.Add to that the story, which is a basic ""kid and his dog cross the wild west"" plot. It's a 60ies Disney-western, coming-of-age story, where each human character was replaced by a dino. Nowhere near the creativity of an ""Up"" or the colorful characters of ""Monsters Inc"".It's a good movie for small children and people with low expectations towards logic and realism. No tough topics like death and violence, just easy-going entertainment without any challenge. If you expect Pixar quality, look elsewhere.","

"ScribblyBug","8 February 2016","I'm amazed at how critical audiences are being of this film - and I'm ashamed to admit I had judged it so harshly. When I found out Pixar was releasing two films in fairly quick succession (Inside Out and the Good Dinosaur in 2015) I was suspicious. After reading so many negative reviews I assumed the latter was a flop and a quick buck for Pixar after the success of Inside Out.Having finally seen the film I can easily confirm it is far from ANY of the above. The Good Dinosaur has plenty of humour and heart to put Pixar back on the map, if only people would give it the chance.The Good Dinosaur provides an infectious amount of humour, with a heart breaking/warming narrative, and truly stunning visuals. The attention to detail is breath-taking, something the animators at Pixar should be very proud of. One thing I truly appreciate about Pixar is their attention to characters communicating through gesture, movement, and imagery. These moments resonate so much more than flat- out dialogue (take the opening sequence to Up, or the effectiveness of Wall-E.) The story itself is somewhat familiar but it works perfectly as a standalone film because the characters drive it so well. Now, I imagine a lot of people will dislike this review and assume I don't know what I'm talking about, but please assume nothing unless you've experienced this film. It's worth a chance. I'll proudly add this to my Pixar collection, and truly hope there will be more from director Peter Sohn in the not-so distant future.","

"ElliesWonder","20 March 2016","Watched: Probably in January or Febuary of 2016A nice movie, at least contains a complete and logical storyline, some cliffhanger and humor. Good enough to be a popcorn movie to relax. It showed a creative idea of a formed society if dinosaur did not extinct, and the movie setup in a dinosaur agricultural society. However the movie lowly hit my expectations, the story is so basic. Indeed some screen are very creative and funny, like the fireflies, and the tyrannosaurus. But the story probably made for kids not adults. The dinosaur boy Arlo and Human Spot dislike each other in the beginning, but bound together by accidents, as normal as any other story would have, main characters are doomed to form a team. Soon after, they became friends,and overcame different difficulties during their journey. Dinosaurs: Arlo overcame his fear at the end, and saved his friend Spot's life. (I was trying to type Alro became brave, but the movie did not show any comparison after he backed home.)Furthermore, I am confused about the footprint: why Arlo is allowed to put his footprint on the tower? In dinosaurs family, tower footprints represent honor, only capable individual who earn their living can desire this honor. It is like a ceremony of growing up. Yet Alro never showed his capacity of helping his family. Arlo was a trouble in the beginning, he did not finish any family tasks, moreover he was the main factor caused his papa's death. He had an adventure indeed, but he still missed his family works. He made no contribution to the family, why would he desire a footprint? Even more, a higher footprint, a better honor abovd his brothers? That is so unfair, the older brothers did all the unrecorded works when their papa and brother Arlo were missing, they worked under pressures.By the way, the death of Arlo's papa very surprised me. I thought Papa was rushed away by the river, and he would come back and have a happy ending. What a heartbreaking when Papa showed up on screen yet turned out it was Alro's dream. Papa already dead. :'(Spot's famil also unexpectedly surprised me. Spot's family was really dead, he is not a lost kid, he is an orphan. The human family at the end, who called him from another side of the mountain probably have no bloody relationships. Maybe they have, old people like inbreeding. However, I prefer they don't, they adopt Spot because they knew he is a same specs from them, and Spot is still a kid. Animal naturally like to take care of cubs. The reason I use the words - animal and cub, is because Human Spot has a human appearance, but he acts like a dog all through the movie. Human in this movie use noseto smell and identify things.When I was watching the movie, I wondered does Pixar trying to send any message be created a human into a dog. But I concluded this might be a hideb American film routine: children and dogs will never die, and dogs always human's best friend. If a dog does not exist in a movie, it always has another character behave like a dog. Just like the horse of Tangled; the snowman Ola of Frozen; Baymax of Big hero 6, etc. So human act dog's role is reasonable from society of dinosaurs. Lastly, artwork. Pixar always creates pretty artist work, fancy scenes, highly comprise to the landscape view. But what's wrong with the toy plastic characters? This is not Toy Story 4, how awkward to see a green dinosaur toy walks into all these beautiful landscapes.","

"bennettde","20 March 2016","My son is really into dinosaurs, so I got this for him, but I enjoyed it none-the-less. I'm surprised by the multitude of overly-critical reviews. It wasn't bad enough to warrant less than 5 stars, in my opinion, let alone those who only gave it 1 star! I think some people really got into over-analyzing this film while watching it instead of just watching it for the sheer enjoyment of what it was.I know my sister hated it, and her reason was because she didn't like the parallel it drew to the Lion King in one particular scene. Yeah, I saw that parallel and didn't really like how similar it was to the Lion King either, but it certainly did not ruin the whole movie for me.Some people are so critical that they fixate on minor flaws and let it ruin the whole movie for them. If you're not one of these people, you will probably enjoy this movie.My opinion was that the beginning was super cute. I loved how the developers asked themselves, ""If you were a dinosaur living on a farm, how would you manage it?"" and then showed how a dinosaur might water the plants, or feed the chickens, etc... Really cool stuff. I loved the personalities of the dinosaurs, too. My only complaint besides the Lion King parallel was that they made the human out to be too much like a dog. They could have really ...not. done. that.","

"lucasversantvoort","14 December 2015","Remember when the Coen brothers released Burn After Reading right after No Country for Old Men? Remember how Burn After Reading subsequently didn't become the hit people were hoping for? I believe the word 'overshadowed' was used. This is what's happened with Pixar, which has decided to release Inside Out and then serve up The Good Dinosaur, which unfairly--but inevitably--comes across as the dessert to Inside Out's main dish, albeit a very fine dessert whose only faults lie with predictability, a feeling of been there, done that.The film opens with the meteorite that wiped out the dinosaurs, except here it barely misses Earth. We're introduced to a couple of dinosaurs that own a farm near a looming mountain range. They have three babies, including the tiny Arlo who's a bit of a scaredy-cat. They grow up and do their chores. Dad makes a make-shift silo to store the food and tells the kids that if they work hard, they can literally make their mark on the silo (i.e. putting a muddy footprint on it). Eventually, Arlo is the only one who hasn't made his mark due to his anxiety issues. Dad tries to encourage him, but tragedy inevitably strikes and Arlo is swept along the river and wakes up in a place unknown to him. So begins his journey to maturity.This is the first Pixar film where I was reminded more than a few times of other Disney films, particularly Bambi and The Lion King. If you've seen those, you've seen The Good Dinosaur. When a herd of longhorns come running, it can only remind one of the famous bull charge in The Lion King. But the similarities extend beyond a few winks and nods. The entire nature of the story, Arlo's maturation, is right out of the book according to Bambi. All that's missing is a 'circle of life' metaphor.That being said, The Good Dinosaur is really well made. It takes a while to set things up, but it's quite engrossing once it really gets going. It's quite dramatic at times, though Pixar is careful to avoid showing any explicit deaths (despite the 'survival of the fittest' theme).One of the film's greatest achievements is the mute human boy, Spot, who Arlo ends up befriending. The keyword here is 'mute'. Pixar manage to fully realize this character, convey his thoughts and emotions, solely through facial expressions and movement, like they did in the first act of Wall-E.This single character made me wonder how impressive the film would've been had there been exactly zero dialogue. Pixar obviously knows how to tell a story and convey emotions in purely visual terms. In fact, some of the most gripping scenes here have no dialogue. A story about a dinosaur having to learn to survive and be responsible lends itself so well to visual storytelling and would reaffirm the power of animation. But I guess it would make Arlo's tale even more dramatic and we don't want to scare away the kids now do we...? The Good Dinosaur is a well-crafted play on familiar themes. Overall, it's pretty clichéd and predictable, but effectively told. It's got some creative humor and even though you see it coming, it still tugs at your heartstrings. Not one for the ages, but The Good Dinosaur definitely makes true on the 'good' part.","

"PrincessTarah","24 November 2015","It is with great sadness that I write this post. After seeing ""The Good Dinosaur"", I must admit that, for the first time ever, I am disappointed with a Pixar film. From start to finish, all I could think was:""Is this really a Disney movie?""*SPOILER ALERT*Today, I went on a journey. I left class early, rushed to get home, booked it to the theater, then drove to a different theater because the first one was having technical difficulties, all in a valiant effort to see the first possible showing of ""The Good Dinosaur"". I finally sat down in my comfy theater seat, and it all went downhill from there.Of course, the film has a lot of classic Disney elements: an unlikely friendship, heart-rending moments, inspirational quotes, and a parental death that will probably scar a lot of young children for life. However, many elements are definitely not in the normal Disney fashion. These included a scene where the main characters accidentally get high off of poison berries, the cutest animal on earth being viciously ripped apart ten seconds after it was introduced, and several more violent moments throughout the film.Now, let's get one thing straight: I am, by no means, squeamish. I routinely watch the violence and gore of ""Game of Thrones"" without issue. I am also a college student, and as such I have seen people gain the effects of poison berries via much less innocent means. The reason I take issue with it here is because ""The Good Dinosaur"" is a Disney movie, plain and simple. While these films can and should be enjoyed by people of all ages, they are principally made for children, for families. And anyone who has seen a Disney film can agree that the scenes I just listed above are out of place for the genre. Even if you only consider this film on its own, completely isolated from all other Disney/Pixar movies, those moments mess up the flow and take away from the overall story.Speaking of things that are out of place, it seems rather odd that a human family just happens to find Spot, and that they just happen to want to take him in, all within the span of five minutes. Even weirder is the fact that Arlo is completely on board with these strangers taking Spot away, without any knowledge of whether or not their intentions are good. You would think that Arlo would be a bit more cautious at this point, because throughout the entire film, he has been misjudging people's intentions. But hey, why stop now? (She said with heavy sarcasm.) As my mock trial coach would say, ‪#‎decisionmaking‬.Of course, we all know that these humans are the nicest people on the planet and will treat Spot very well. It's obvious, because it's a Disney movie. The problem is that we never see that develop. These people just show up, out of the blue, at the very end of the film, to claim Spot. While the familial sentiment is good, it is also totally random.Another thing I will mention simply because I found it hilarious: the majestic Tyrannosaurus Rex, running through the fields at sunset while maintaining a posture that would put princesses to shame.Overall, this film is just okay, which is why I'm so disappointed. I'm used to Pixar producing these life-changing films that melt even my ice-cold heart. But ""The Good Dinosaur"" just didn't. I didn't feel a connection, to the story or the characters. While the film is visually stunning, it lacks the essential element that Disney (normally) creates so beautifully: substance, depth, life. It was a good idea, and it has a good message (which it repeatedly beats the audience over the head with), but the execution is flawed.I didn't want to write this post. I didn't want to dislike a Disney movie. I tried so hard to enjoy it, to find the beauty, the depth, the emotion. But I just couldn't. I hope that this film makes a lot of people, both young and old, happy. As for me, I'll continue watching ""Inside Out"" until the release of ""Finding Dory"" in 2016. And I'll keep my fingers crossed that Disney/Pixar will melt my frozen heart once again.","

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","28 January 2024","What if the meteor missed?Right from the start, this sets up a version of Earth where dinosaurs(we follow an Apatosaurus) and cavemen(which can be very animalistic, somewhat similar to dogs in some ways) coexist, though they do not trust each other. And the former have actually developed modern agriculture - they use their heads, in particular their mouths, the way we humans use our hands. Not everyone's a farmer. Their society somewhat resembles the wild west, with different species being rustlers, bandits and such. As usual this allows for a lot of fun designs and world building.The animation is breathtaking as usual. Great use of color and shadow. Movement is impossibly fluid. It's amazing how much they can so clearly convey with nuance through body language. A lot of the nature seen, such as trees, rocks, wind and rain, is photorealistic. Like everything Pixar, it will break your heart. There's action, comedy and sweetness. The message of perceiving others not only through how their actions affect you but also why they end up doing what they do, as well as the one of overcoming one's fear, may seem obvious, but these are important for children to learn and they are communicated rather well.I recommend this to everyone. 8/10.","

"krahl-81949","9 December 2015","Animated films are Disney's forte, especially when combined with Pixar studios that has brought so much success to the trademark name. The Good Dinosaur is Pixar's 16th venture into animated film territory and brings all the experience and technology to the forefront. So does this iteration achieve the same heights that their other films have or does it fall to the bottom of their list of average films?I'm a crazy super fan of everything prehistoric, especially dinosaurs. Most of my childhood was spent on reading and absorbing all knowledge about these colossal awe inspiring beasts. Any films or documentaries related to dinosaurs, you can bet that I've watched it. While the animation industry hasn't seen too many films based on dinosaurs, the few that have been produced have been of decent to high quality. ""Dinosaur"" from the year 2000 was a wonderful Walt Disney film with realistic environments, excellent visuals for its time and a decent story while ""Ice Age: The Dawn of Dinosaurs"", was purely animation, delivering a fun film with a decent story. ""The Good Dinosaur"" takes Disney back to the same territory, but this time with Pixar in tow.Continue reading the review at my blog:https://microreels.wordpress.com/2015/12/09/the-good-dinosaur-film- review/","

"joshvonhousen","25 April 2016","The strength in Pixar's ""The Good Dinosaur"" lies within it's quiet moments. These moments show great maturity and pacing and everything that a film like this should have. These scenes are perfect. Unfortunately, the whole movie isn't like this. I know, it's a kids movie, but, who knows? Maybe a film with complete silence and atmosphere could prove to be successful! The two scenes that work are as follows. There is a part where the main dinosaur, named Arlo makes his family by putting sticks in the ground and then making a circle around them. Then, Spot does the same. Arlo buries the stick that represents his father and Spot buries all of the sticks besides the one that represents himself. The whole scene has very little dialogue and is very moving. The second is when Spot finds a group of other humans. Spot greets them, and Arlo lets him leave. But, then Spot comes back, but Arlo convinces him that he needs to be with his own kind. This scene is COMPLETELY SILENT and is the best scene in the movie. It's all reliant on the faces and atmosphere. The rest of the movie was just a typical road movie with bad voice acting. The landscapes look good, though.","

"morrison-dylan-fan","23 March 2016","With the Easter holidays coming up I started to look around for titles that a friend could enjoy with her family.After being taken by the mind-set of Inside Out I was happy to discover that Pixar's second film of 2015 has come out on DVD,which led to me getting ready to find out how good this good dinosaur could be.The plot:Not having a heart to kill a caveboy,an Apatosaurus called Arlo decides to set the caveboy free,which disappoints his dad Henry.Going on a search for the caveboy,Arlo and Henry get caught in a flash flood.Lifting Arlo to safety,Henry gets caught in the flood and dies.Returning home,Arlo helps his mum Ida,brother Buck and sister Libby to gather food for the long winter ahead.Whilst out gathering food,Arlo spots the caveboy and chases after him.Rushing after him,Arlo and the caveboy fall into a river which knocks Arlo out.Waking up,Arlo finds himself miles from home,with only the caveboy to keep him company.View on the film:Arriving with years of production ""issues"" stomping on it,(from the original cast and director Bob Peterson being sacked,to the third act getting emergency script-doctor work) the screenplay by co- writer/(along with Peterson/Erik Benson/Meg LeFauve & Kelsey Mann)director Peter Sohn keeps everything on the surface,which leads to Arlo lacking the emotional depth which appears to be on offer.Whilst keeping everything in clear sight,the writers spin a joyful buddy Road Movie,as the tenderness that Arlo develops for the survival of the caveboy,is joined by frantic dinosaur battles which go from a deadly group of pterodactyls to a cowboy inspired T-Rex.Backed by a shimmering score from Jeff and Mychael Danna,director Peter Sohn gives the Jurassic setting a lush appearance,with the earthy rough waves and fresh green grass giving the movie a tranquillity atmosphere.Standing out from the realistic backdrops,Sohn gives the lead characters a bold design,thanks to the light green of Arlo sparkling and the hairy caveboy darting across the screen,as Arlo reveals himself to be a very good dinosaur.","

"Ramascreen","23 November 2015","Hands down, #TheGoodDinosaur is the best movie of the year. It was a really tough decision for me because #TheMartian blew my mind, but THE GOOD DINOSAUR just hits all the right notes. It's fun, it's awe-inspiring, it's full of surprises and it melts your heart. I don't know how it would've been like had Bob Peterson still been in charge of it, but what Peter Sohn and his fellow screenwriter and the story & animation team at Pixar have crafted here is nothing short of a masterpiece.The film asks the question of what if the asteroid missed the earth resulting in dinosaurs and humans coinciding, essentially. But the other idea that THE GOOD DINOSAUR also presents is a switcheroo, by having the dinosaurs act and behave like humans and having the humans behave like your man's best friend. An Apatosaurus named Arlo lives with his farming family. Unlike his siblings, Arlo gets easily scared, so his dad, Poppa, tries educate him about courage, but Arlo ends up learning it by experience when he forms an unlikely friendship with a human as the two travel their way back home.There's a bit of ""Bambi"" and ""The Lion King"" element going on in THE GOOD DINOSAUR but I think it's because often times, coming-of-age or the rite of passage can only happen once the children are out of the parents' home and they apply the wisdom they've heard their entire upbringing. If you've come to get that good cry that most Pixar movies often deliver, you'll definitely get that and a bag of chips with THE GOOD DINOSAUR. And to add to that, this is also probably the most daring movie Pixar has ever produced, meaning that there are aspects about it that are not necessarily brutal or violent but Pixar pushes the envelope just a little bit further just to emphasize the harshness and the danger of the landscape that our characters have to venture their way through.I can't praise the animation enough, you'll be amazed at how real-like some of the sceneries look in this film, it's as if they took a shot from the national geographic segment and combined it, hybrid-style, with their already detailed animated characters. The designs are aimed to give you that sense of wonder and they also reignite your childhood love of all things dinosaurs. Speaking of the characters, you will fall head over heels for the friendship of Arlo and Spot, it's like watching pre-historic ""White Fang."" And the setting is the frontier, so the dinosaurs have their own jobs, there are the villains that hunt and scavenge, and the T-Rex's that happen to herd the bisons, so they're pretty much cowboys complete with harmonica and thick accent. These encounters will lead Arlo to becoming the dinosaur that can live for something larger than himself.Another thing that you're going to love about THE GOOD DINOSAUR is that if you're looking for a father & son story, you'll get that, if you're looking for a story about overcoming your fear and becoming courageous, you'll get that too, if you're looking for a story about coping with the loss of a loved one, it has that, if you're looking for adventures and death-defying thrills, it has those too, there's also a part about adoption, which is something that I'm very passionate about, so you can take any good themes off the book shelf and you'll find them in THE GOOD DINOSAUR.","

"Jerghal","17 February 2016","In the Good Dinosaur the meteorite that wiped out the Dino's misses earth and the Dino's become the dominant species on earth. And despite their lack of opposable thumbs they all become farmers with a sort of Texan accent. So they're stupid AND they can't work their tools. Awesome. But the humans strangely enough also roam the earth but they must have been held back by the Dino's or something coz after millions of years they still are Neanderthals despite having opposable thumbs and bigger brains. The creationists at Pixar must have taken over and had a field day with the script it seems. Anyways, the main character, the 'Good Dinosaur' which should have been called the 'Cowardly Dinosaur' coz he fears EVERYTHING loses his parents and has to find his way back home and learn to conquer his fears on this journey. Sounds an awful lot like 'The Land Before Time' another overrated piece of junk. Very original Pixar. Just give up and make Cars 3 already... I digress...so the main coward Dino is boring and I didn't like him very much. The dog-like critter child (on his back on the poster) is more fun but we have seen this before in 'The Croods'. Again with the stealing Pixar? I probably do not have to spell it out but I did not like this movie at all. It's a new low point since Cars 2 and I even liked 'Inside Out' better, that one at least had an original and engaging story. The best thing about this film is the almost photo-realistic scenery. Some shots almost look like live action photography. The Dino's on the other hand look like rubbery plastic toys (that's probably easier for the merchandising) which makes them stick out like sore thumbs. Maybe kids will like it (they liked Cars 2 so what do kids know right) but other Pixar movies appealed to adults too. So if you have to take your kids to this one take a pillow with you and take a nap. And if your kids have good taste it might be wise to bring their pillows as well.","

"masterekblasterek","21 September 2021","This movie could be a really good Pixar movie, but yeah... they tried to make something like Lion King, but...no just no. This movie I really weird a lot of scenes are weird or out of context. First of all why Arlo have to kill the thing that eats family's corn. That was too much for him. Then the scenes with this weird Triceratops, t-Rex cowboy scenes out of context. Main villain is weird and unnecessary. Also making a pet from a human is so inhuman. But two scenes where a really amazing and heartwarming.the first one is where Spot and Arlo show each other what happened to their families and when arlo comes back to family and his mom says his dad name when she sees him. Anyway still better than Cars 2, but anything else it's just bad.","

"kglovesdogs","30 March 2021","For my animated film, I chose to watch The Good Dinosaur, a 2015 computer-animated Disney-Pixar movie. The asteroid that was supposed to destroy Earth passes by and dinosaurs thrive millions of years later. Arlo, a timid dinosaur, has a trouble making his ""mark"" on the silo which his entire family has marked. He traps a caveboy but then lets him escape because he feels bad, so his dad leads him to try to find the caveboy. In a storm, Arlo's dad is swept away by a river and he is left alone. Arlo adventures through the jungle, finds the caveboy and names him Spot, then eventually travels all the way back home to be reunited with his family.Overall, I thought that the computer animation and voice over was incredible. For example, the opening scene displayed a beautiful pan of the landscape where the dinosaurs lived. It showed the river running over a bed of rocks and a field with tall grass. Here at the start of the movie, I was surprised and thought for a second that I was looking at a real field. Furthermore, the voices for each of the characters was very well chosen. Arlo's voice fits his timid character while his mother's voice is calm and mature as is her character.I would rate this movie a 7 out of 10. I thought that the story was quite average for a Disney-Pixar movie. The main character loses his father and has to overcome his fears to come out on the other end...pretty basic. But overall, I was impressed by the animation and how realistic it looked. I enjoyed watching the movie, and I was still entertained despite a somewhat simple plot. I heard that a few people cried during the movie, so I was expecting to as well because I'm usually an emotional viewer. Sadly, I never felt moved to tears.","

"scottshak_111","8 December 2015","""You are me, and more."" Disney and Pixar have been bringing the inanimate alive ever since they showed up in the animation arena. Their powerful CGI, splendid landscapes, heartwarming music, top-notch touching plots that complement their melting frames can hardly go unnoticed. It is as if you can feel the reality paint the big screen with their gorgeous animation. The Good Dinosaur is no different except you wish there was more to the story.Even before the movie begins, we feast on a lovely short called ""Sanjay's Super Team"". It glorifies a subdued Indian animator Sanjay Patel which was a first in the animation world. The story of the short rotates around his childhood shenanigans with a mythical backdrop to it. The gist of the tale is captivating and you almost begin to wonder if children should ever be deprived of a fantastical world they live in.SPOILERS AHEAD: The Good Dinosaur score slithers in the background with a brilliant fusion that is downright riveting. The movie begins with the genius of an Apatosaurus family, keeping in mind the what-if-the-meteor-had-never-hit-us circumstance and focuses on how they are trying to earn their livelihood whilst attempting to leave their marks by being good at things.Arlo is the most relatable creature, a protagonist trying to overcome his fears, whilst endeavouring to leave his mark too. A tragedy befalls him, a shattering one that breaks him to pieces, and flings his life into chaos. He meets an accident, gets lost amidst all the confusion and ends up in a foreign land. About the same time he meets one of the most adorable creatures, Spot, who is like a rabid-human who has lost his family and is wandering at large. Arlo befriends him in a quest to reach home and find his mark doing good to his friend.The first thing that blows your mind away almost instantly is the level of imagination the creators have. Then you perceive how much work they have put into making their fantasy a reality. The level of details they incorporate whilst making a movie is really commendable. You can see every droplet move, crops dance, animals react and watch water come alive. They make the inanimate breathe, which is simply out of the world. True creators they are! If you look at the plot, there is really not much to it. The movie being about the dino-era finds similar species to keep you entertained. Story and sub-plots seem to have been built deliberately and almost seem clichéd. The cute, snappy and slapstick humour of the flick however will constantly engage you in fits of laughter. Arlo and Spot are just adorable.The movie like every other Pixar movie is a lesson per se with brilliant thoughtful liners that escape from the mouths of different creatures. Screenplay is well written, at times however you wish there was more substance to it.A delightful movie about a thoughtful wonderful what-if!","

"lisafordeay","7 December 2015","I seen this yesterday in the cinemas alongside my brother who was dying to see this film and my mom tagged along too. This is Pixar's 16th animated film and their second after the Oscar predicting movie Inside Out(which I am sure is gonna scoop an Oscar next year). The Good Dinosaur is about a young dinosaur named Arlo(who was voiced by Raymond Oslo)who was the smallest of the litter of dinosaurs as he has two other siblings. Of course Arlo's father wants Arlo to be brave and strong as Arlo is a scaredy cat and his father wants him to stop behaving like this and sends him up a mountain where Arlo can face his fear. However a strong gush of water swept his father and his father tragically dies. Meanwhile Arlo later meets a Tarzan like boy named Spot(who behaves like a dog,which happens in a lot of Disney movies nowadays take Tangled or Frozen where the sidekicks were acting like dogs)and Arlo later befriends him,as Arlo too gets swept away on ashore and gets lost. So its up to Arlo and his new friend to find their way back home.Good: The animation in this film is gorgeous in actual fact I had NO idea that the backgrounds were CGI as I felt like I was watching a live action movie with CGI dinosaurs thrown in. The characters are very endearing my favorite has to be Spot and of course Arlo as they are very cute together and their back-stories was very good. As for the voice acting it was also brilliant. Like Big Hero 6 I had no idea who was voicing who until I seen on IMDb that Anna Paquin from X Men was in it or Frances McDonald from Miss Pettigrew Lives For A Day. With voice acting in animated films I also picture the actors in my head sometimes they work more times you just can't see them as their charcthers only the actors that voices them. Yes I know that I love Tangled and Shrek for example but I knew every single actor/actress in those films,here I didn't picture any of the actors in my head.Also there was a few scenes that had me choking up with tears. Myself and my brother just lost it near the end of the film and in another scene too which I am not gonna spoil.Bad: If I had to pick an issue it has to be the story. Now the story was very endearing and heartwarming and it was the ONLY Pixar film in history so far to make me cry my eyes out but you have seen this story before. Think of it as The Land Before Time meets Tarzan with a hint of The Emperor's New Groove & The Lion King and you get this little gem.Overall you should definitely go and check it out. Is it any better than Inside Out well Inside Out took us to a whole new level,this film was just a safe film.But overall I liked it and I will definitely be watching this one again.7/10Very Good","

"Red_Identity","27 December 2015","It's a shame that this film has rather come and gone like nothing. I don't think it's anywhere close to being the worst Pixar film. It's true that it's not as great as the best offerings that Pixar has given us, but that should not matter. The film should definitely be seen as a very good animated work, and as a very good film in general. It's very simple in its structure and plot, but it really highlights the best thematic issues that Pixar can do so well. The emotional engagement with the two lead characters is strong, to the point that it may actually be one of the strongest duos that Pixar has offered. It certainly doesn't hit the emotional depths or complexities that something like Inside Out did so great in developing, but this is still a strong entry in the studio and is rather underrated.","

"divyanka","5 February 2017","This movie had no diverse plot or character development. The relationships between characters wasn't in-depth at all, especially between the boy and the dinosaur. The main title of the movie depicts only them, but the movie does absolutely nothing to show that they mean anything to each other. Their friendship is undeveloped, but suddenly, they act like they would die for each other. The boy's inability to speak throughout the movie is annoying as well, and the illustrations aren't good. The movie is very simple and basic, with no real twists, turns, depth, convoluted plans, but just a very simple story line that suits very young children. For all the advertisements and trailers of this movie, it should have been much better. Some emotional parts were captivating, however, such as the father being gone and when the dinosaur has to save the boy. But other than that, it is lacking.*5/10*","

"americanodude","23 February 2016","This movie has received quite a bit of flack from movie viewers of all ages and creeds for quite a few reasons; While many of the reasons do, in fact, detract from the film in its entirety, this was not a ""bad"" movie by any means, it simply could have used a little better direction . So, I am going to break this down into 4 categories and give my two-bits on what I thought was done well and what could've worked better for the movie. FIRST, there is the animation itself. The animation was flat-out the best animation I have ever seen in a movie. The water, countryside, rocks, pebbles... it was all so realistic I could've sworn I was watching this on a live-action background; The beautiful tapestry of that background did so much for this film and actually made me want to pay attention to that rather than what was happening plot-wise. With that being said, it bridges over to the negative aspect of the animation which was the characters. Perhaps Disney/Pixar wanted to go with a more ""kid friendly"" aesthetic, almost like play-doh, that would make it easier to market/ship for children. While I can respect that decision, the fact that the beautiful scenery when compared to the characters made them all the more bland. It would be akin to having a steak dinner where the steak looked overcooked and tasteless while the side dishes were exquisite. SECOND, the story itself. While the story itself was campy and a bit misguided, it had everything a plot needs and was executed decently. Kid lives on a farm with his family (Beggining), Kid gets lost (Conflict), kid must traverse a large terrain whilst conquering his fears/the elements(Middle), kid finds a home for spot and also gets to go home to his family(Resolution). So while it has the basic elements to a story, I feel the translation of the story gets lost in it's execution with how it played out. The bits where he meets other dinosaurs that all have distinct societal groups (herders, farmers, hippies, scavengers) felt like they all were rushed through and never quite came to fruition. Rather, if he had made the journey alone or with only spot at his side it could've cut down on the cliché side-characters and added more to the inner feelings, movement of Arlo's character. THIRD, the characters. The only character that ever really felt ""real"" seemed to be a Arlo. Sure, the other characters had personalities, but from what little we did get to see of characters' personalities was a very small and cliché renditioning of the type of character they were. For example, the father T-Rex was a grizzled, scarred herdsman with a mouth that, from which, only wisdom and a deep, somber voice could be heard. The only other character that I felt had anything else about them was Thunderclap (the pterodactyl leader), if only for the blatant religious extremism that he portrayed, which was at least interesting to witness; Overall, however, his fanaticism did little to save the integrity or give the other characters any form of real importance or meaning to the movie as a whole, if this film had another dynamic character (not counting spot because what does he learn? Essentially nothing, he is the same character at the end of the film as he was at the begging the only difference is he has a new friend and a family) it may have had a better character resolution than what the ending provided. Speaking of which, that transitions into the FINAL bit, the ending. I think the ending is where I draw the line between a 6/7 for this film. The fact that Arlo jumps into the water AND goes down the giant waterfall without at least himself or spot being severely injured is just the big, painful stroke that puts the final bad taste of bland steak into your mouth. The whole scene just throws everything out the window and makes most viewers ask the question, ""If Arlo, small, tired, and weak as he is, could survive that experience, then why couldn't his father who was stronger, healthier, and not to mention 3ish times Arlo's height and at least 10 X his weight survive it as well?"" It just stumps me how they let that bit play out given what happened at the begging of the film, but I digress. THE POINT: This movie is flawed, filled with useless characters whose animation paled in comparison to the scenery, a run-around plot, unneeded and out-of-place moments, and has a horrible ending. However, I still came out of it with a positive enough reflection due to: the more depressing scenes tending to hit their marks, the astonishingly amazing scenery, and a wholehearted feel that still kept me entertained throughout the entirety film despite its flaws; Solid 6/10 and I would say is worth your time if you have a free hour and a half.","

"kindtxgal","30 June 2016","It is clear within 30 minutes of the film why it has a PG rating. Bugs are having their heads ripped off and a cutesy animal that is rescued is devoured (on screen) by carnivorous birds. Not exactly the type of viewing a child, particularly younger ones, are prepared to see amidst a ""good"" dinosaur that's fearful of just about everything in his young life. Arlo, the star character is a runt dinosaur afraid of everything who has yet taken the opportunity to do something outstanding so he can leave his mark on the family silo. He is cute as a button, as are many of the characters, but I simply don't think it's appropriate for youngsters to be subjected to heads being ripped off bugs and a Furbie-like looking mammal, newly rescued after Arlo helps save him, to be then jolted into its demise. Cartoons, particularly Pixar and Disney are meant to be child-friendly, not delve their spirits into death and devouring in full animated glory. That's my biggest complaint. I really can't wrap my brain around the concept of dinosaur ""farmers"" and dog-like humans. There's nothing in our culture or collective knowledge to help make these ""gags"" palpable and cute or clever. The animation artwork is quite stunning however, but I would not recommend this video for a very young child under seven as they're sure to be upset with the in-their-face animated demise of a cute, cuddly mammal. It's just too harsh for them in a cartoon setting which are historically comforting, safe-feeling, and innocent. I would not be able to show this film to an elementary class below the age of fourth grade and that's a stretch. Deeply disappointed & surprised Pixar chose the path of sensationalism & death in at least three scenes in the film. And what was the first five minutes supposed to be saying? It easily could have been left at as it doesn't seem to connect with any of the following scenes.","

"DavidLindahl","6 April 2016","Pixar released two films last year, Inside Out and The Good Dinosaur, the story about the little dinosaur Arlo. Here Pixar plays with the thought of what would have happened if the meteor that exterminated the dinosaurs years ago would have missed and the giants would have survived and lived on. Now they are intelligent creatures that can run farms with crop and move large herds of animals around. A fun little idea from Pixar who quite often comes up with interesting post apocalyptic half worlds. The dinosaur Arlo loses his family and is forced to find his way home with the help of his companion, a small dog like human boy.The Good Dinosaur contains the classic child becomes adult concept. Arlo is the weaker one in his family and not the one they expect great things from. Naturally, when he suddenly is left for himself, he must confront his weaknesses and overcome them. Talking dinosaurs is nothing new and names such as Disney's Dinosaur and The Land Before Time, comes to mind. Arlo faces a lot of danger on his journey, and surprisingly not just the classic one, the largest dinosaur is the most dangerous one, but also nature and the adventure in itself is a major obstacle for Arlo.The Good Dinosaur is a pleasant little family film which I definitely recommend. The animation is at times the best I've ever seen and the music is just beautiful. Pixar continues to deliver these special stories, preferably with some kind of twist. The film was apparently hard to complete and it does from time to time lose focus, especially in a scene where they experience hallucinations from a drug like plant. Strange considering that it is a film for children. But all that aside, The Good Dinosaur delivers when it should.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se","

"jadepietro","9 December 2015","(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is recommended. In brief: A mammoth undertaking that entertains even if it is woolly at times.GRADE: BThe new animated film from Pixar, The Good Dinosaur, bases its existence on a what if theory: What if that deadly asteroid missed the earth millions of years ago and dinosaurs went on to rule the world? Granted, it is an interesting enough premise that stirred the imaginations of its filmmakers. But perhaps a better what if question would have been: What if we would have taken more time to rewrite the screenplay? The film does suffer from some script issues and plot contrivances, but the animation still impresses and the film has its share of poignant moments that are emotionally attuned for adults and children alike. Solidly directed by Peter Sohn (who took over for Bob Peterson), the film is always entertaining and engaging.￼We follow the adventures of Arlo, the runt of the litter who fears everything in his world. To him, and many of the young audience members, this world (and film) is a real scary place. Forced to fend for himself due to the inexplicable forces of nature, our hero learns to survive the deadly food chain with the help of a wild child that he befriends and names Spot. Their friendship becomes the crux and guiding force of the film.This boy / dog theme is a major plot device that works very well, as does the idea of the importance of family in one's life, even if the script by Meg Lefauve makes some bad choices by adding some scenes that do little to advance the plot (a hallucination-induced bout of poisonous berries, a western-themed sequence involving rustlers, a dream episode involving father and son). These detours seem like filler and veer away from the central storyline and its impact.￼The main character, Arlo, is also in need of some revision, as it is renders. It comes across as too cute in a clumsy Gumby sort of way. In fact, most of the characters lacked refinement and are too simple and cartoony. (An exception to this complaint is the pterodactyls that are slight exaggerated to maximum effect and filled with glorious menace and the facial reactions and movements of Spot the Boy Wonder.)￼But Arlo and the other creatures lack the necessary details to be memorable characters, especially when viewed against the photo-realistic backdrops that are truly astounding. The vista and panoramic scenery are the film's most stunning accomplishment. The lighting and textures are remarkable in their state-of-the-art visual expertise (more so than their character counterparts). The layered backgrounds continually capture the beauty of nature that is awe- inspiring. (The firefly sequence is memorable for its lyrical splendor.) These surrounding landscapes are handled with pure artistry even if they completely upstage the characters and story. ￼That said, The Good Dinosaur, has much to recommend. The reviews have been overly unkind to this film and undeservedly so. While it may not be one of Pixar's best, it certainly was a noble effort that is worthwhile viewing for the epic vibe alone.

"Reno-Rangan","4 March 2016","To be honest, I have been looking forward this since the day I came to know about it. But it took so long to come out, even the Windows OS has upgraded thrice since then. After all these years, now I feel this is not what I wanted. It should have been different, especially the story. It was a fine animation, including all the technical aspect had no issues, but the story was not convincing.Seemed just like another version of 'The Croods'. In fact, crossover between these two would be awesome like the boy from this and the family from other title as an original family who lost each other for some reason. But the trouble is, both are from the different production house and coming together is a tough task.The civilised dinosaurs? That's kind of weird, but in a children's story and animation, all are fair. So I turned into one and enjoyed it. Apatosaurus are farmers, T-Rex are cowboys, yeah whole new perspective, apart from the humans who are still in lower on the chart of dominance and intelligent.In my opinion, I'm being honest with what I felt. The theme about self discovery and to throw away fear is inspiring for the little children. At a same time, it is not a freshly developed story, kind of reminds 'The Lion King'. I know they're not same, but the initial parts are, between father and son. You can watch it once or twice, because it is not a boring film, but not the best.7/10","

"jarnewillems","5 April 2016","Being on a plane for 10 hours and not having a lot to do, I came up with the idea to watch one of the free movies you can watch. My eye immediately fell on ""The Good Dinosaur"", which I've wanted to see for a long time now; the reason I hadn't seen it yet is because I wanted to see the original version in 3D, but I couldn't hold myself any longer: on a tiny screen in a plane it was :p. In the movie, we learn about a dinosaur named Arlo who is growing up together with his parents, brother, and sister on their farm; until, one day he meets a human boy: Spot. This will set the tone for the adventure we experience together with Arlo and Spot.The movie's storyline is pretty simple and filled with clichés. I can see why people wouldn't like it. I, myself, personally did though. I did, I loved it and I think many people will. I will tell you why. The story isn't a masterpiece, but the movie is. The execution makes the watch totally worth it and makes you love the characters AND the story.The movie starts of and ends with the reason why i wanted to watch this movie: cute dinosaurs. These creatures are pictured so nicely i could watch them for hours, and i don't know if i could resist to buy a dinosaur plushy now if i'd see one now. Especially Arlo is cute as f***. Really. But not only the cute dinosaurs are making this movie good. It is beautifully animated. Some scenes were breathtakingly beautiful. Especially landscapes made me wish i was watching this on a huge screen in 3D, but it was beautiful anyway ^^. As I said earlier, the movie is filled with clichés and the characters' actions aren't exactly surprising. But i don't mind, personally. It's what makes the Disney movies so sweet and I totally love it. The movie did make me cry at some point, but I won't spoil ^^. It just gets very emotional :p. If you like cuteness and heartwarming Disney-dinosaur action, you've found a new favorite, just like I did. Astonishing visuals and cute dinosaurs make everything you see worth every second. Thank you, Disney , for one of the cutest movies i've ever seen, and i will definitely watch it more than this one time.","

"jenflynn","26 November 2018","I have enjoyed many Disney Pixar movies, and this one still stands out. There is a huge moral of the story, if people are willing to actually SEE and HEAR it. Arlo was the runt, never being able to catch up to Libby & Buck. Throughout the movie, there are several points in which Arlo is put to test his ability to overcome obstacles and serious fears. This is about trust, about making a friend who you may not have otherwise. Arlo and Spot are enduring. By the end, they truly care for each other. And we see Arlo finding his voice, his courage, and strength, to follow in his Pappa's big feet. And when I watch my 3 year old granddaughter, this is the movie she asks for first. (Then Frozen, of course).
Watch it with a child's eye. I have seen this about 40 times (seriously) and it still makes me tear up a bit. Besides the absolute beauty of the cinematography, the story is wonderful.","

"flamingblok11","29 November 2015","DisneyPixar insists that you call this movie The Good Dinosaur. However, my snark tells me that a more appropriate title would have been The Pedestrian Dinosaur.The newest offering from the beloved animation studio that gave us the Toy Story series, and most recently Inside Out, features a figuratively yellow and literally green dinosaur named Arlo (Raymond Ochoa), and his pet human, Spot (Jack Bright). The pair, separated from their families, go on an all too familiar adventure to find their way home.The film, helmed by rookie director Peter Sohn and penned by sophomore Meg LeFauve, can't help but feel like lesser Pixar fare, on the level of Brave or the Cars films. The uneven tone and poor pacing, coupled with the less than taut script, give the film a mediocre quality, especially considering the greatness we've come to expect from DisneyPixar.It isn't a mortal sin to be predictable, and not every film needs to revolutionize the industry. That being said, The Good Dinosaur can't escape from out of the shadows cast by its better, more innovate older siblings, like The Lion King. From Dumbo in particular, the film borrows a lot, including: the themes of family, belonging, and finding one's self, a smaller, braver sidekick aiding a young pariah of an animal, and a strong mother/son bond. The film even has its own pink elephants-esque sequence in which Arlo and Spot eat fermented peaches. It is hilariously out of place, albeit exceedingly brief.I don't mean to say that the film is offensively bad; it simply isn't particularly remarkable. It attacks its subject matter from a juvenile perspective, without offering many laughs or interesting details for anyone older than thirteen. The voice performances aren't especially strong, and the characters aren't memorably cute. Arlo and Spot are no competition for the likes of Mike and Sully.The film seems to exist as a glorified tech demo. One that DisneyPixar didn't feel like tinkering with anymore, but decided to wedge a story into and bill as a feature-length movie for very little children. The scenery is absolutely breathtaking and majestic, and special attention seems to have been given to the water effects, which are inarguably the best ever seen in an animated film.The photorealistic landscapes are in stark contrast with the oddly cartoony and largely undetailed characters, further strengthening my idea that the movie itself was merely an afterthought. If you took Arlo and Spot out of the film, nearly any frame could be hung in the MoMa without much backlash or argument.Feel free to watch the flick on ABC Family in a couple of months, if you really like Pixar films. If you're just looking for a cute, short, animated story, try to find a theater that's still playing The Peanuts Movie instead.","

"r96sk","5 February 2020","I was fairly surprised by how much I enjoyed the 'The Good Dinosaur'.It features some real touching scenes, which were helped by the solid voice cast and strong animation from the Pixar team.I do have a few grievances, I felt the film copied a few things from other productions. One being the way Poppa Henry went out, while Spot was basically Donnie from 'The Wild Thornberrys'.","

"clearthinkernow","13 August 2017","I am so glad I didn't spend any money on this movie, I borrowed it from the library. Used to be the name Pixar meant quality. Now that is no longer true. When it got to the end (finally), I thought to myself what was this supposed to be about. What was the purpose of it? How many of you knew when Poppa and Arlo went out that Poppa wasn't coming back? Too often done in these ""children's"" movies, do you think? Then the poor grammar--what's the point of that? That animals aren't smart enough to speak properly? Really? Cavemen here are so dumb that they can't even speak at all and likewise they can't walk upright either. Tired of this indoctrination to children. If cavemen were that dumb, they would not have survived and we wouldn't be here.","

"WalkdenEntertainment","10 January 2019","Brought to you by the skills and talents that created Toy Story, Finding Nemo and Inside Out is the latest film ""The Good Dinosaur"".Early on we see our main character ""Arlo"" hatch from an egg and begin to enjoy family life with his Father, Mother and two other siblings. As you expect for a Disney film, Arlo stands out from the rest of his family, suffering from fear of the world. His fear slows him down from completing his daily chores that are necessary for the family to survive.One day while Arlo is protecting food on the family farm he sees a small human child (who really acts like a dog) stealing his family's food. Arlo's father decides that enough is enough and decides to challenge Arlo in hopes to try and make him grow as well as also overcome his fears. It is during this something moment that something tragic happens... (Classic Disney)Arlo returns home but shortly afterwards he sees an opportunity to complete the task his father set him.During Arlo's big adventure into the wild there wasn't a single character that I enjoyed and I hoped see again. Every character is forgettable and not memorable, some even being mean and silly. None are funny or show the exciting, fun side which you almost expect to see in Disney films. Other characters included a Rhino, T-Rex's and Pterodactyl's- even with cool animals like these and more I feel all of them are annoying and even painful to watch.To be very honest, this was a Disney movie I really disliked. This Disney title provides outstanding visual and stunning audio details (As if Pixar could ever fail at that) but this film overall is sad and easily forgettable.The film starts off very sad and at some points it feels like the level of sadness keeps building. Alro does team up with a side kick, but when the sidekick is a boy who acts like a angry puppy dog it feels as though there is a lack of depth. With these two Disney characters I feel we are seeing many missed opportunities.Forgive me if I sound harsh, but to be positive there is one stand out scene where our two leads share a fantastic scene communicating about family and their parents (again it's all very sad).By the time the credits rolled I was so curious: how on earth did this film (in 2015) have the final results considering its Pixar? With light googling I discovered this film had many issues during development, including the story writing, casting changes and finance issues. When you watch this film all of these issues feel evident given the end result.The Good Dinosaur overall has all has stunning animation (which always amazes me) & includes a 7.1 HD track which will really let the neighbours know you're home. But the pain in this film is the story and it's characters. To this day I still quote Many Pixar films and long for Nemo 2 & Toy Story.
This film I have forgotten already and there are no characters or quotes worth remembering here.4.8/10

"leonblackwood","27 March 2016","Review: This movie has a sweet storyline with brilliant animation but I was left feeling empty at the end. I would have preferred the movie to be about Spot than Arlo, because his character was much more interesting and you never get to find out how he ended up in the wilderness, away from his family. When the two, lost souls, meet up in the middle of nowhere, it's great to see how they build there emotional relationship together, even through Spot can't speak a word of English. I also enjoyed the farming scenes at the beginning of the movie, with Arlo's father, mother and butch brothers bonding together but it all seemed a bit safe to me. Like many Pixar movies, the animation is spot on and the attention to detail is truly amazing and there are some touching moments, like when Spot reunites with his family and when Arlo loses his father, so you can tell that the director really did concentrate on every aspect of the project. The downside of the film is that there isn't enough characters to bring different elements to there amazing journey and you know from the very beginning that Arlo is finally going to get his paw print on the rocks. With that aside, I still enjoyed the film and I'm sure that the kiddies will love it but it won't go down as a Pixar classic. Enjoyable! Round-Up: I can totally understand why it takes so long for Pixar to release a film, because of there in depth graphics which take a long time to render for the big screen but with such a big workforce behind the established production company, the anticipation that is felt whilst waiting for there movies, is beginning to wear off. With big studios like Sony and Dreamworks releasing profitable animation movies like the Hotel Transylvania franchise, the successful Kung Fu Panda franchise, the How To Train Your Dragon franchise and the Madagascar movies etc., Pixar really need to go back to the Toy Story/Incredibles storyboards to get back there untouchable reputation which produced unforgettable movies. Anyway, this movie was directed by Peter Sohn who also made the Pixar short, Partly Cloudy. This is his first major movie for Pixar but he has supplied his animation skills for the Iron Giant, Osmosis Jones, Finding Nemo, the Incredibles, Ratatouille and Brave. He's obviously got a history at Pixar, so he's not totally new to the game but it still felt like there was something missing in this movie, because it's not one that I will be rushing to watch again.Budget: $175million Worldwide Gross: $321millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/adventure/comedies voiced by Jeffrey Wright, Frances McDormand, Steve Zahn, Sam Elliott and Peter Sohn. 5/10","

"cto-27427","13 February 2016","Our family loved the movie. Yes it had some issues that need to be explained to a child but that is the reason for the movie. Fear, anger, sadness, lonely, family, lost etc are all things that need to be explained to children at some point. My whole family loved it and laughed and asked questions. Ages are 6, 7, 8, 13.There is no reason to hide these subjects from a child. It is best to learn them and understand that they are real and how to deal with them like Arlo does. The landscapes are beautiful and the characters are a little cartoony on purpose. Spot is spot on. Love that little guy.","

You know Pixar? The company that made Cars, Up, Ratatouille, Toy Story, etc? Well WTF Pixar? Little warning next time? First of all the short that appeared before the movie was way too scary. Our daughter buried her head into her mom and covered her ears thru much of it. In the main movie dialog like the crocodile died by drowning in my own blood? Let's name the boy Murderer? Let's have the birds eat the cute little animal just to prove they are bad guys. Sure! Why not! Writers, do you not have kids or do you have older kids and forget what little ones consider entertainment? Mine loves My Little Pony for instance and even can get nightmares from that never mind watching the fathers face as he's taken away from a torrent of water. you know this isn't being watched by adults right?Movies for adults are so violent these days, is this meant to prepare them? Seriously disappointed. The darkest Pixar movie to date.","

"Vartiainen","29 February 2020","The Good Dinosaur is the story of Arlo, a herbivore dinosaur, who gets pulled far from his home by a storm flood. As he travels back towards home, he's joined by a young human boy, who he names Spot. You see, in this movie dinosaurs are the dominant lifeforms, and humans are more akin to wolves or something along those lines.So it's basically a ""boy and his dog"" story, but with dinosaurs and human animals. And sure, that could work. That does work. To a certain point. While I do like Arlo and Spot as characters - Spot especially - it cannot be denied that they're very clichéd and not much is done with them beyond what you'd expect.The world of dinosaurs is also odd and filled with discrepancies. Like there are these T-Rexes, who are supposed to be cowboys and they talk about riding out and such. You know, typical cowboy stuff. Except there are no horses... So why are they talking about riding? It makes no sense. Stuff like that.I also really hate the whole ""making your mark"" plot point the movie sets up. It's such a forced metaphor and it serves no need for the story. We could reach the same emotional impact without it being shoved down our throats.That being said, the movie looks ridiculously good. Especially the backgrounds. I mean, they're downright photo-realistic. Pixar must have cheated and simply sent a crew to film in Yellowstone. That's the only explanation. Filthy cheaters, the lot of them.The Good Dinosaur is by far not the best effort we've seen from Pixar, but it's a cute, inoffensive little tale about a young boy learning to stand on his own four feet. I can dig it.","

"MrDHWong","26 December 2015","The Good Dinosaur is the second of two Disney Pixar films released in 2015 (the other being Inside Out). While I enjoyed it for the most part, I didn't find it to be on the same level as Inside Out. It has great visuals but a surprisingly predictable story.The film takes place in an alternate universe where dinosaurs never went extinct and live alongside humans. A young and cowardly Apatosaurus named Arlo ends up getting swept away by a torrential river while trying to catch a feral caveboy trying to steal Arlo's family's food storage. After finding himself a long way from home, Arlo eventually catches up to the caveboy and befriends him. Arlo later names the caveboy ""Spot"", and the two set off on a journey to find their way home.Filled with amazing visuals, The Good Dinosaur is so far one of the best looking 3D animated films that Disney has ever made. The soundtrack was great too, it perfectly complimented the most sweeping scenery the film had to offer. Unfortunately the story offers nothing new. It's the usual ""face your fears"" and ""journey home"" type of plot, which is fine but if you're expecting something deeper and more philosophical then you'll probably be disappointed. Overall, it's a pretty decent entry into Pixar's already expanding library of films and worth at least one viewing for its visual style alone.I rate it 7.5/10","

"almightyminiman","23 November 2015","I went into the movie thinking that it would be a little too childish for me. But it was much better than I expected. What really drives the movie are the interactions between the two main characters and the amazing visuals.The story is a bit lackluster, which is the main downfall for the movie. It is predictable and pretty simple and unoriginal. But the interactions between the dinosaur and boy are amazing and genuine. They hit the comedy right, and do an exceptional job at the drama. Though the uninspired story holds it back a bit, the strong characters make up for it.The visuals are stunning. It almost feels like they made the movie just to show off the scenery, effects, and animation. It really is top quality.Music is fitting, though no particular track stuck out to me. The focus was more on the characters, and the music simply reinforced it.Overall an amazing movie. Highly recommended!","

Both did not find it scary as others have said, they laughed and they got emotional at parts and at the end even my littlest totally got the meaning behind it-but I'll not spoil that. Not a bored moment whatsoever and I hope pixar do more like this and ignore the ridiculous negative reviews. Highly recommended to give it a watch and just enjoy it for what it is. Yes, it's a little different but it's such a precious, emotional yet also very fun story to watch. All you could want in a family movie.","

"andrewchristianjr","8 November 2021","The Good Dinosaur was okay. It does have beautiful animation in the backgrounds but the animation with the dinosaurs themselves is really out of place. Also the story can become quite predictable. Also the characters Arlo and Spot aren't that memorable as the other Pixar characters. There's honestly nothing really new to Arlo to make him stand out like the rest of the main characters. Another thing is that this movie is really forgettable and if can be hard to like the film for Arlo's adventure of being brave while there are so many movies that do it better.","

"elgriego-07772","12 February 2016","One of the best animated movies I have ever seen. Yes maybe it is not a comedy and maybe 3 years old may prefer Toy Story and Cars. But this movie teaches so much more than living into a bubble of naivety and ignorance. It introduces concepts that may be harsh for little kids but no more harsher than Lion King where the concept of the loss of a father is also present but everybody loved it. Plus fantastic/absolutely out of this world(literally) animation and rendering that is next to none. I have never seen water and generally the environment been rendered so realistically. I was blown away. And what a great opportunity for parents to explain several concepts of real life to their children. I remember the first time I saw ""The Rescuers"" I was 8 years old and I started crying as I was introduced to darker concepts. It was one of the most amazing animated movies I will never forget. Crying isn't bad when you have your parent to help you through the emotions. Pixar and Disney have produced a marvel and I would like to see more.","

"TheOneThatYouWanted","24 March 2016","I'll just cut to the chase here because I checked the spoiler box; the Good Dinosaur has a hand in his father's death and almost doesn't release his pet human. Not sure if you should call him good or not. I wasn't a fan of him, in fact after his father's death I didn't even want to finish watching the movie. I just wonder if this was based on a book or something because the director should have change it. It would have made for an easy fix to have had the Good Dinosaur get lost into the river and start his journey back from there. It would have been a better movie for it because we would have gotten more of the good things about this movie, like him interacting with strange dinosaurs and etc. I understand the message behind this film about fear and all but I do not think any child under the age of 6 needs to see this kind of movie. The animation was well done and a few of the dinosaurs were funny for a few second but other than that, not worth passing up other Pixar movies for..","

"aidanratesmovies","11 April 2020","Although it is beautifully animated, The Good Dinosaur proves to be nothing more than a bland Pixar Ice Age ripoff, and is quite honestly the worst to come from the animation company yet. The plot and story is quite generic, and even though the runtime only clocks in at about an hour and a half, it can be pretty boring. The film's world seems incredibly dull, and the characters for the most part seem incredibly played out. There are a few characters that are better than most, and prove to be more than average. The film never really earns any laughs, and instead feels far more fit for younger audiences than families all together. It has some good messages, and some good performances from voice actors involved, even if the dialogue and characters themselves are rather thin. In the end, The Good Dinosaur is nothing more than a generic prehistoric attempt from Pixar and the gang, and proves to be nothing more than a bland disappointment.

"cartoonfreak1989","29 December 2015","Imagine the most brilliant children's picture book ever. The visuals dazzle the eye, the characters seem to almost leap off the page. The story is nothing special or complex, but it's shown so well that one cannot help but be charmed by it, even with the knowledge that it was never aimed at you.That, in a nutshell, is The Good Dinosaur. In theory, it's a tale we've all seen many times before: the story of a boy and his dog (or, in this case, a dinosaur and his boy), and it does little to subvert or avert the tropes of this rather specific genre. What sets this movie apart, however, is the presentation.The film is set in an alternate timeline (fans of the Pixar Theory will struggle to fit this in) where the dinosaurs never became extinct, and instead evolved, mostly in intellect, to form a primitive, human-esque society. T-Rexes herd cattle as a relatively stable food source. Herbivores, like our protagonist Arlo and his family, grow crops on the family farm. Such things are realised in clever fashion, using the size and abilities of dinosaurs to great effect.This is not, however, some sort of idealised, stereotypically Disney form of nature. This is a world where characters struggle to survive, and a world where even an Apatosaurus like Arlo can seem small. The runt of his family, our protagonist appears from his very first scene to be a perpetual coward. While his siblings are able to use their own strength to make a positive contribution to family life, Arlo only manages to make things worse. After a spectacular failure to capture a thieving critter, tragedy (of the entirely predictable sort for this type of film) strikes. Soon enough, Arlo is lost, far from home and with the critter – a primitive human whom he names Spot – as his only companion on the way home.So yes, fairly standard stuff on the surface. Take a liberal helping of The Land Before Time, a dash of The Lion King, and a sprinkle of The Jungle Book, and you would appear to have The Good Dinosaur.This description fails to do the beauty of the film justice. To put things simply, this is easily the best-looking film I have ever seen. The backgrounds are so detailed and grand in scope that I found it impossible to keep my jaw from dropping. Many people raised concerns about how this would gel with the cartoony character designs. To my pleasant surprise, it never felt out of place, for reasons that people smarter than myself could no doubt discuss. Each character moves beautifully, Arlo in particular being the perfect representation of a creature constantly on edge.The voice acting is an unexpected treat. Raymond Ochoa nails Arlo's voice, capturing every emotion while always keeping the character likable. Jack Bright does a great job with his wordless performance as Spot, hitting every sound with just the right inflection, finding the balance between human and animal that the character needs. The secondary characters are a nice blend of cinematic actors, Pixar veterans, and director cameos. Sam Elliot steals the show as Butch, a grizzled old T-Rex cowboy who provides some of the film's best lines.With that said, the film is light on dialogue, with many scenes moved along purely with visuals and the power of the moving score (I downloaded the soundtrack as soon as I got home from the cinema, and it's been on a near-constant loop since).As much as I like the movie, it is not without its flaws. Some early scenes do drag a bit, with one in particular that could have been eliminated entirely with only a minor rewrite. The film's road-trip structure leads to a heavy reliance on coincidence. Arlo and Spot bump into character after character with only the flimsiest of reasons. The world is at once the most sparsely populated and densely populated land in existence. Still, if you don't mind the road trip structure (and there's a lot that can be said in its favour), you will probably not mind it here.In conclusion, The Good Dinosaur will probably not top anyone's list of Pixar's best. While the themes and emotions are powerful, it lacks the depth that defines the studio more than anything else. Where films like Inside Out or Up are arguably as much for adults, The Good Dinosaur is undoubtedly a children's movie. In all honesty, however, that is not a bad thing. Sometimes, one just wants a simple story that doesn't talk down to children, and in this regard, The Good Dinosaur is a roaring success.","

"goolizap","9 December 2015","You can't blame Pixar for anything really. It's tough to find things, but honestly they're there. The films almost always follow the same signature moves: the long journey home, the unlikeliest of friends, the conceptual antagonist. And then they always include the signature Dumbo effect, where they just hand you a character who is so cute that you can't help but love them--and, in turn, the movie. But no other film does these more blatantly than The Good Dinosaur. Let's face it, you can attribute much of Pixar's success to these attributes. People fall for them. However, when it becomes this obvious, you start to take notice unlike ever before. And with this film, it's more evident than ever that the studio's biggest pitfalls are what have made them the powerhouse that they are today.The film follows Arlo--the runt of the litter of talking dinosaurs--as he tries to discover what his true mark on this earth is. After a series of events finds him extremely far from home, he must figure out his way back with the unbidden assistance of a feral, dog-like child, Spot, who is actually inadvertently responsible for a few tragedies in Arlo's life already.The Good Dinosaur is the most Pixar-iest Pixar movie thus far. So much so that it's becoming increasingly more obvious what they're doing and why they're doing it with each film that comes along. This one's a ""journey home film"" in the strictest way possible--not really playing around with that concept a whole lot like they do with Toy Story or Wall-E. Of the 16 films made by Pixar over the last 20 years, I'd say all but three of them are about the characters finding his or her way back home. And I understand why--mostly thanks to this movie--because it's easier to find conflict. Throughout the film, there is mishap after mishap, without much room to breathe or develop it's own organic voice. I wouldn't say it's predictable, but it does have a tendency to be by-the-numbers a bit.It also may be the weirdest Pixar movie to date--which actually helps set it apart from the others. In one scene, we see Spot literally rip the head off of a live bug that's the same size as he is. Another has a pterodactyl eating a cute furry little creature. In perhaps the most odd moment of the film, Arlo and Spot eat some hallucinogenic fruit and proceed to trip out with much detail.But it's not to say that I didn't like this movie, because it's actually very pleasant. I mean, he humor is just middle of the road--I probably laughed the least amount out of any Pixar film. But I was also smiling throughout a lot of it. Also, the visuals are spectacular--a triumph in its own right.The depth of the characters are another highlight, as both children and adults will be able to relate. Arlo is likable, but not Disney perfect. He shows hints of selfishness and stubbornness, which round him out well.You'll hear pleasant echoes of City Slickers, which is perhaps the movie's most unique quality. It's not as tight nit as you would expect. It starts off painfully slow, but mostly picks up after about 30 minutes. Also, there is not a lot of tonal balance found. It makes jarring leaps between comedy and sheer terror in a few instances.We see your road movie, Pixar. We're just curious if you're using it as a fallback now. Try moving away from it more often. 2012's Brave was awesome. It felt like one of the most unique films to come out of that studio.While The Good Dinosaur is actually a really good movie, and I like it way better than Inside Out (yeah, for real), I still think that Pixar can do a whole lot better. At least with this film I can watch it multiple times and not get frustrated doing so.In staying the same, it's safe to say that Pixar has devolved a little bit with The Good Dinosaur, but nonetheless, it's still way better off than what most other studios serve up as their animated offerings.Twizard Rating: 91","

"nameslump","25 March 2022","This movie was a one hour and thirty minute tec demo of how well pixar can make breath taking water mountains and trees and make it look so realistic and then they smack some cartoon dinosaurs that move like they have broken limbs sadly that's all the positives the story feels like they are trying to subvert your expectations a lot in this movie just so the audience thinks oh no will they really make it out ok and they do it doesn't work because it's a Pixar movie not a Stephen king novel they have a lot of death talk in this movie witch they try to shock the audience with and falls flat the dad dies witch kinda isn't a spoiler because you only know hime for twenty minutes before his death and if it wasn't for arlo complaining about it this whole movie I might have forgotten about it and the last negative is arlo complains a lot in this movie witch he is justified in most the time other than when he blames spot for his dads death witch was his own fault but nevertheless all his complaints and whines get really tiresome.Overall:
If you need to pop in a movie to make the kids quite you could do worse than this movie and if you think you might wanna watch this movie give it a try at least to the thirty minute mark before deciding to turn it off and if you think this movie will be bad or boring your feelings probably won't change as this movie goes on.","

"Enchorde","3 December 2016","The Good Dinosaur must be one of the most beautiful animated movies I've seen. Some scenes, i.e. the fireflies or a few shots of golden sunlight reflecting in water are just incredible.Beautiful as it is it is somewhat lacking in script and comic finesse, which Pixar and Disney usually excels in. This is more of an adventure movie than comedy. More of a western for kids than something funny. Sure, there are quite a few funny moments but not so much haha than it is cute. There are few jokes, and those that Pixar otherwise do so well, the jokes that work for both adults and kids are very rare. It is still a good movie, but it isn't one of Pixar's best. Keep your expectations reasonable and you will enjoy it. And be amazed by its stunning graphics.7/10","

"Gin225","17 March 2016","I rated this a 6 because although I didn't like this much, my 5 year old did. The movie was slow and pretty much humorless. It developed more of a plot and a pace towards the middle through the end. I only liked the cowboy dinosaur voiced by Jeff Bridges or someone that sounds like him. If you have a timid child or a toddler or a young girl, they probably won't like this movie. Which is confusing from the poster and trailer. It appears to be a young children's movie. The background animation is incredible, the main protagonists/dinosaurs are drawn rather childish. Quite a difference. The situations that occur, well you have to understand, this is a dinosaur world. So in that world, it's eat or be eaten. Why would any parent find that disturbing. (I read some of the other reviews) My favorite character is the young boy. But again this movie is from the dinosaur perspective. So the main protagonist for me was boring and I didn't care for him till three quarters through the movie. My son liked the gross parts, the relationship between boy and dinosaur. The adventurous parts. He didn't understand certain situations. And he was overall happy with it.","

"owen-watts","17 July 2023","Pixar's first bomb is a strange sort of a thing - and definitely feels like a narrative desperately panel-beaten into shape with a massive amount of self-doubt. There's a lot of needless stuff, odd tangents and weird choices. A big narrative pay-off only makes sense when you see the deleted scenes. It really is a tangle. To compensate, it looks like they poured all their time into making the environments utterly stunning, which makes the cartoonish (almost Aardmany) Arlo look really out-of-place. There are a series of vignettes in the middle, with Arlo and his little wolf boy, which are genuinely lovely - and it feels like the film should never have been any more than that. Pixar are so good at short films, it's such a shame that their first big flop was something that should really have just been one.","

"jfj1","17 April 2016","We were looking forward in seeing this movie, we saw walking with dinosaurs in the cinema, and my kids love all about dino's. However this story is very boring and disappointing. it could have been awesome but it isn't. Kids wanted to stop seeing it half way but somehow we managed to finish the movie and were eventually happy it was finished. Do not expect too much of this movie. Take a hughe bag of chips, preferbly more than one as you need it to distract the kids and adults that are watching the movie. The story itselve is outdated an not exiting enough to keep the kids attention. Somtines it boring and too long.","

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","19 May 2019","Because ""Jurassic Yellowstone Park"" would have been too confusing of a title, we find ourselves with ""The Good Dinosaur"". I honestly did not expect this to be a western, but that's what we have here: incredibly beautiful scenery, living off the land, and cattle rustlers. Although, to be honest, I would pay to see this exact same movie without the really cartoony-looking characters and just all the amazing scenery they were able to produce with computers.
But seriously, the plot seems tried-and-true, but with the characters reversed (the human is the pet), which is unique in that sense. And, as all Pixar films do, I did find myself as a weeping mess by the end of it.","

"aciessi","13 July 2020","The forgotten Pixar movie. But why? Why did it fall to the wayside? Overshadowed by Inside Out? Yes, and maybe rightfully so. Is it Pixar at their very best? Maybe not. But as a product, it's pretty good. The backgrounds are stunningly photo realistic. The story is touching. It felt like a throwback to The Land Before Time. Surprisingly, it's also part comedy and its hilariously funny. It's on Disney+. Worth discovering.","

"billygoat1071","28 November 2015","The Good Dinosaur is another high concept from Pixar, asking what the world will be like if the meteor never hit Earth and dinosaurs continue to rule the world. The film's theory is dinosaurs will talk like people, farm like people, fear like people, etc. While people themselves are now their vermin. To sum everything else up, this is survival tale with a total Western vibe, except with dinosaurs, and it is an unlikely result to an intriguing question that it was trying to sell with the audience. And it's strange since the origin of this world seems more interesting than the conceit itself. However, this is a pretty old fashion animation that shows innocent nature while going through darker situations, mostly told by visual storytelling. The best thing to say is nothing's particularly groundbreaking about this movie, though it's quite an admirable film when there isn't much dialogue and we see these innocent beings interact during tougher times. It's quite lovely, even if it keeps stalling to cute moments, but despite of its flawed narrative, the movie manages to flourish its charms, anyway.The film is mainly about a young apatosaurus dinosaur, Arlo, who is learning to fight his fear after being lost away from his family. He is also stuck with a feral little human boy who was once their farm's pest and now forced to be together as they both face the same situation. And despite their bond is more about finding food and fighting other strange creatures, it's quite endearing how nearly wordless and expressive their smaller moments are. Some moments may really seem just stalling, allowing the visuals to bring something cute or gorgeous on screen, but it does earn something a lot to the experience. It may not always mean something, but think of something like Bambi or Disney's Snow White; even though there are moments that don't always move the plot forward, it's still an affectingly wonderful moment that you don't usually get from many animated films nowadays, but would love to remain settling with it.The plot itself is just stumbling into one place to another, meeting another set of characters after another set of characters, despite that these characters have more dialogue than the interaction of the main two, they're rather forgettable and that is odd for a Pixar film. Whether you like the movie or not, whether they're the main characters or just secondary, they always have a place on your mind and even heart to remember from a punchline or just personality, but here, they're just, again, forgettable. But I guess Arlo and Spot are good enough characters, though it's just strange that the others exactly aren't. But it sure is visually dazzling. Despite that the dinosaurs are obviously fake looking, the backgrounds are just amazing. That alone could already be worth the price admission.The Good Dinosaur also has been in tougher developments which we could see what's lacking in the story, but the movie manages to gloss it over with stunning imagery and delightful and heartwarming moments. There's also a scene between the two lost kids which doesn't quite need a lot of dialogue to express what they're feeling, it's just a quieter warmth that used to define the old Disney animation and that's kind of a refreshing experience for a while. You may not find enough depth in here, but for what it is, it's a kind of a beautiful film; about surviving whatever is up with this world and trying to find empathy towards something that is supposed to be a common enemy. It's not even close to the quality of another Pixar film this year, which was Inside Out, but there is still a lot to like in The Good Dinosaur.","

"antoinedb2001","25 November 2015","The Good Dinosaur is another Disney Pixar film released in 2015, the first one being Inside Out. after watching the movie on opening day with high expectations, I got what I wanted. It is a fun family film with good characters, a good story, and great animation. so what's good about this movie is it a hit or a miss? well we will see after the review.The good stuff: I have to say that first off the animation is INCREDIBLE! everything has it's own little detail, plants, trees, bushes, rain, etc. even the environment that the dinosaurs live in is breathtaking and it is beautiful to look at. the character animation isn't bad either, every character in this movie has some great animation to them. I like the characters in this movie. they have good qualities to them and are very well voice acted. the human cave boy named spot and his relationship with the good dinosaur himself, is where the heart of the movie is. there is not a dull moment whenever the two are on screen together. The father of the good dinosaur is a good character and you learn to like how much of a good character he is until he dies early on in the movie. The bad stuff: the story at times seems to drift away from the movie a bit and we run into characters that we never see again. there is a scene with a triceratops where he tries to keep spot after seeing him in action and after the good dinosaur gives him a name the triceratops just runs off when one of the animals he carries decides to run away. there is also a scene with a family of tyrannosauruses that take the plot to a different story. while a good segment you never hear from them again or see them.some parts of the story has been used before in a Disney movie. but it's used well here.Final verdict: the good dinosaur in terms of story is not their greatest attempt, with some unique characters, some great animation, and a well executed coming of age story, this is a family film worth viewing this thanksgiving.8/10: pros- great animation, good characters, well executed plotcons- certain points of the movie draw away from the main narrative, used clichés.","

"datautisticgamer-74853","18 June 2016","The Good Dinosaur is one of the few Pixar movies to have highly polarized reviews (alongside Cars 2, though faring slightly better) as a result of how for most film companies, it's amazing, but for a big studio like Pixar, it's a disaster. The story takes several elements from other movies such as The Lion King, including the death of the protagonist's father and the return of the father as some sort of spiritual reincarnation. Despite offering some funny and scary moments, it makes the film moderately predictable in many spots. The main plus I will give the film is for its animation and rendering; even though the characters look somewhat more cartoony than Pixar usually does, the backgrounds are nothing short of exquisite. I actually think that it's better than the animation in Inside Out when it comes to portraying its setting. The characters are the most polarized of all: some are stereotypes but are still sufferable due to their actions, even if some are highly questionable (how can bug wings be used as a harmonica?). I took notice of Spot being quadruped very swiftly, and the way that prehistoric humans (which is an assumption, by the way) have behaviors more similar to wolves than apes. Arlo is obnoxious in some ways but does learn some valuable, if cliché, lessons by the end. Overall, The Good Dinosaur is a middling movie as just a movie, but among Pixar's worst films. It's watchable but highly monotonous, so think deeply before you consider watching it.","

"ravsten428","6 April 2016","I had huge doubts about watching this movie. I saw some clips of it on YT and thought it didn't look very good.I was wrong! Naturally watching only a few snippets from a movie doesn't justify it. You have to really watch the whole thing to get your opinion.The Good Dinosaur was a good film. It is different and edgy and I love that kind of thing. A lot of people don't and I understand not everyone loves this film. For the people on here bashing all of the bad reviews I say this, everyone has a right to their own opinion whether you agree or not.On to the movie.This movie was great! There were a few things I didn't care for such as the many references to killing things. The biting from Spot was unnecessary! And don't get me started on the berry scene. Other than that the movie was great. Nice color and animation. Although the T-Rex leg movement was not the best for running. Very colorful and captive to the eyes. Thank you Disney/Pixar for this refreshing change of pace.The Good Dinosaur has my mark of approval!","

"Genti26","3 May 2016","The Good Dinosaur is an animated comedy-drama adventure film and the 16th Pixar animated movie. It is directed by Peter Sohn and written by Meg LeFauve. The movie asks the question, what if the asteroid that supposedly wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, missed ? The main character is Arlo, a young dinosaur who lives with his parents and two siblings at a farm. After a tragedy occurs with a close member of his family, he then has to go on an adventure, where he will learn many things and even befriend a human being, Spot. This movie is just great in every sense of the word. I genuinely do not get all the hate that this has received, I mean sure it got a very good and certified fresh 76% rating on Rotten Tomatoes but many people are calling this as a disappointment simply because it is not the next Toy Story or whatever. Grow up people, cause not everything Pixar does is going to be perfect, and if you can't accept that then the problem is with you, and not the movie. This is definitely one of the best looking animated movies ever made. Sure the characters are not as real looking as the landscapes in the background but you have to remember that this is an animated movie, and usually they are meant for kids who really do not care if a movie looks perfectly real or not. If the character designs are your problem that you're definitely just nitpicking. The voice cast is brilliant all around, and maybe it doesn't have stand out voice performances like Inside Out does but then again, Inside Out is one of the best animated movies ever made so you can't really compare these two simply because they were made by the same production company. The Good Dinosaur is also very touching and heartfelt with a very good message, plus it is for adults too with many jokes that kids will surely not understand but the older can enjoy and appreciate. So basically there's something for everyone here and yet again it made the least money for any Pixar movie ever, which is just stupid. I hope people buy this more on Blu-Ray and DVD so that it does not continue to be as underrated as it as right now.","

"dsruss-770-941629","23 December 2018","One of the strengths in the Pixar canon is their ability to tell stories of facing fear and how this can make you stronger, how being scared isnt a weakness but a chance to grow. This is Pixar at it's most literal in that regard. A simple tale told in gorgeous panoramic chapters about family, friendship and the journey from childhood to young adult. And honestly, as a parent, it's a meditation on the rush we sometimes place on this growth for our own convenience. Heavier themes than some reviews give it credit for, but they are there nonetheless.","

"tjgoalie13","6 December 2015","The Good Dinosaur is a good film from Pixar, that suffers from the heavy expectations of being a Pixar film. If this film had been made by any other studio it's reviews may have been a little more positive, but considering the pedigree of Pixar this film falls slightly short. The Good Dinosaur is funny, gorgeously animated, but suffers from a slightly weaker story than has become expected of Pixar. That being said it's still a very enjoyable film, that kids are sure to love.As with many other Pixar films, The Good Dinosaur does have a few of the studio's cornerstones. The Good Dinosaur features a great sense of humor, and a fun overall tone. The film also has a lot of emotional depth, in that department The Good Dinosaur feels very much like a Pixar film. The reason that The Good Dinosaur has such a good emotional depth, is the character development of the main characters. In all of those ways The Good Dinosaur lives up to the expectations of Pixar.The animation in the film is gorgeous. While the script may be a little weaker than some other Pixar films, The Good Dinosaur may have very well broken ground in animation. The animation looks real, is meticulously polished, and flat out looks real. The score, large panoramic backdrops, and certain plot elements make The Good Dinosaur feel a homage of the classic Westerns. However, this becomes an issue as the film progresses.The main problem of the script is that it's unfocused, which is surprising, because most Pixar films are extremely focused and groundbreaking narratives. At times The Good Dinosaur feels like a western, at times it feels like a comedy, but no one overall feel is kept, the film switches erratically. Another problem is that the pterodactyl characters are poorly developed and they drag the film down. They don't have real motives, they just appear and act like a mix between stoners and storm chasers.In conclusion The Good Dinosaur is a good film from Pixar, but falls a little short of their normal standards. While the story is weak for Pixar's standards the film is still very deep, and features glimmers of classic Pixar. Still kids will probably have a good time with this film, as it's funny, beautiful, and emotional, just not the strongest thing Pixar has made.","

"ajoftexas","12 July 2016","When I first saw pixar's latest film, I expect intense action and some hilarious moments, but instead it ended up as a boring standard dinosaur movie. Arlo is okay. Spot was okay and the other characters....most of them didn't get much screen time but there okay. If it were a Pixar short, it would have been better. The movie didn't get my attention at all. I mean this is Pixar, Disney's cgi animation industry. They always get my attention with comedic jokes and moments that makes us cry, most of the time. ""cough"" ""cars"" ""cough"" the movie tries to do that, but failed hardly. All I want to do when is see this film is just fall asleep throughout the entire thing. Good dinosaur is the most standard animated film ever. Everything is just okay to the maximum including the new stuff as well. There is nothing that this film has to offer considering the characters, most of the animation, and the story behind it. This movie is just nothing but....okay.","

"Marwan-Bob","12 February 2017","Pixar and Disney's latest is an animated adventure based on the premise that 65 million years ago dinosaurs never went extinct and are more advanced than the human race. When a rainstorm washes poor Arlo (Raymond Ochoa) downriver, he ends up bruised, battered and miles away from home. Good fortune shines on the frightened dinosaur when he meets Spot (Jack Bright), a Neanderthal boy who offers his help and friendship. Together, the unlikely duo embark on an epic adventure to reunite Arlo with his beloved family. The photo realistic landscapes are breathtaking and the film has real heart and a few scary moments young children might find a bit too much. It's a great family film and definitely recommended.","

"ayoreinf","7 December 2015","After the chameleon Rango took on spaghetti westerns, the thunder lizards are doing the same for the other sort of westerns- the stories of the pioneers of the west. We even get both versions of pioneers, the vegetarian dinosaurs representing the farmers, while the meat eaters are the cowboys. And both are getting a favourable treatment.But lets forget the trivial details. It's not a story about what if the famous asteroid didn't hit earth neither an exploration of humans as would be pets. It's a heart warming coming of age story using dinosaurs and humans and other animals to demonstrate the universality of these issues. As is, it's very well done animation, with great characters, and great characters' portrayal by all involved. Loved the visual brilliance of it all, not only the technical aspects of it, which are the standard nowadays, but rather the inventiveness, that depicts the birds of prey as the sharks of the sky.I read here a few saying it's a nice story but not Pixar's best. They must be among those who went head over hills for Inside Out, I didn't, I like this one way more. It doesn't pretend to invent the wheel, it's just plain good story telling, and I'll never tire of good stories.","

"Spartan_1_1_7","10 February 2016","The Good Dinosaur is the second release from Pixar in 2015 (Other one being the amazing 'Inside Out'), and I was really looking forward to watching it because, well, It's Pixar, CMON!! The movie takes place in a setting where the asteroid that killed all the dinosaurs missed earth, resulting in them to keep on living for millions of years more. Now this is a really interesting premise and they could have done so much with it, but sadly we only get a buddy- up adventure type movie. Not that there is anything wrong with those types of films, they can be pretty fun but I just can't help but feel like a huge opportunity was wasted here just because of that approach. Anyway, so the movie focuses on a child dinosaur in a family of dinosaurs, which are obviously sauropods (But not sure which one, eh who cares), and are living on a farm because I guess dinosaurs not dying out have evolved them a bit more. Some stuff happens and the child dino now has to find his way home while being accompanied by a human child, and now we have our buddy adventure story. Now the movie does some things really great. The animation quality of the environments and surrounding are simply gorgeous. Photo realistic beauty. The level of detail in some areas was so great that you almost forget that you are watching an animated film. Along with that, there were some truly genuine great moments/scenes in the movie that you have come to expect from Pixar's brilliance. They were beautiful, tugged on my heart strings and I wanted more of them. The Soundtrack was also pretty good. But then there is the other side; the story was lackluster, the secondary characters weren't anything special and the movie wasn't particularly funny/humorous, which isn't bad per say but to have a serious movies, you need a better story, which this was certainly lacking. The overall execution just didn't felt right, made the movie to not naturally flow between scenes of brilliance. Also, what's up with the weird dino design. They looked off to begin with but then coupled with the gorgeous surroundings, the contrast just became too profound. Wish they did em like dinos from 'Dinosaur'. The couple of amazing moments give you hints of something that could have been another pixar hit, but the less than stellar scenes in between strung together with a lackluster story made for an experience that, although not low enough to be called mediocre or even bad, still ends up being a disappointment. For all intents and purposes, this is not a bad animated movie overall. It is just not a great one either. It is simply normal, which was a disappointment for me as I was expecting a lot more from the premise and from Pixar. I would still say it is a worth a watch it if you like animated movies. 7/10","

Everything except the characters looks so good. So why not spend some time on developing good looking characters instead of some play-doh lookalike figures... Second, where is the story. They have a farm (WHAT? They are dinos!?) and the father dies like in Lion King and he tries to get back home and find himself (like any Disney movie). No antagonist and surly no protagonist in this movie whatsoever. The main character does nothing but wine and makes awful decisions. Very hard to like him and treats the boy like a dog, even naming him Spot and tries to kidnap him when he sees the boys family. Awful, so disappointed. Why even make the movie? Good animation though.. Well I'm done, wouldn't have done a review but IMDb says I have to verify my account.","

"Imdbidia","30 April 2017","The Good Dinosaur is a feast for the eyes, really wonderfully animated with amazing almost real backgrounds and water. My favorite scenes were the night ones, when the fireflies and the starry sky, which are beautifully artistic. The Good Dinosaur is mostly a coming-of-age story, transitioning from child to boy. The movie teaches children great life lessons, and that is, to me, the main virtue of the film: > They have to find their own pace in life, and have to be patient if they move slower than others. The important thing is to get where you want to get, it doesn't matter how long it takes. > Being strong and being powerful are two different things. > The beauty and power of mateship. > Fear needs to be embraced, not feared, as embracing it will make them face any adversity and overcome any struggle. > They belongs with their family, no matter how much they love their friends. > Their parents will do anything to support and defend them, but part of growing up is just learning to be independent. > They are capable of more than they credit themselves for. The story happens in an alternative past when the meteorite that caused the extinction of dinosaurs never fell on earth, allowing dinosaurs and humans to coexist. I thought that was a good start. The creative possibilities are endless, although The Pebbles sounds like a very credible alternative past. So the creators probably didn't want to go there, understandably. Unfortunately, the path they took is a road to Bananaland. It turns a herbivorous dinosaur with the brain of a chicken into a farmer. What the heck? Not even that, the kiddo who becomes dino Arlo's best friend behaves more like a dog than a primitive man, tongue hanging out and all. There are some touching tender moments in the film, and some funny moments too, but the film is overly dramatic for small children, with tragedy after tragedy, violent scene after scary scene, and it's too much.The characters were a mix bunch, overall funny (the tyrannosaurus), scary (the Pterosaurus), human (the brachiosaurus) and brute but domesticable (the human kiddo). I especially loved the voice of Jeffrey Wright as Poppa and Frances McDormand as Momma. Very warm and charming.A lovely family film, especially good for small children. Not the best Pixar's for sure.","

"stephendaxter","25 December 2015","'The Good Dinosaur' is the latest film from wonderful Pixar studios, and their second one this year after 'Inside Out'. It is a very light-hearted family friendly film that follows a dinosaur who gets lost from home, makes friends with a little human and goes on an adventure... a rather uneventful adventure. Pixar are known for their striking visuals, great themes and morals, fantastic humour, memorable characters, and their incredible ability to craft unique and original stories. Well, the visuals definitely deliver, some of the themes and morals were fairly strong, the humour is kinda present, the characters were OK, but where this movie completely dropped the ball was in the originality and storytelling department. This movie was supposed to be released way back in 2013 and has since been riddled with many issues and problems that ultimately did have an effect on the quality of the film. The film was pushed back to 2014, where there were lots of re-writes to the point where the director and producer left the film, making the final product completely different to what it was originally going to be. It was pushed back to 2015 due to more story issues and it is definitely visible in the final result. I will start with the positives, this movie is probably Pixar's best looking film to date, the visuals of everything from the dinosaurs, to the nature and landscapes and even the weather effects were so beautiful and stunning that it really does suck you into this animated world. Everything was so perfectly polished that it looked very realistic whilst also incorporating Pixar's signature animation style that only gets better and better with every new property. In terms of the performances i thought it was just average, pretty much the whole film is led by performances by young child actors and none of them really did anything great with the performances. I thought the best of the performances were by Steve Zahn and Sam Elliott who gave their secondary characters very distinct and interesting personalities that i wanted to see more of. It isn't really the kids' faults as they are probably very inexperienced but still, there was nothing great about their performances. This movie, like pretty much all other Pixar films deals with certain themes or morals that are designed to allow viewers of various age groups to connect with the film on a more personal level. This film deals with the obvious ones like family and belonging, but also goes into confidence, and overcoming fears, and i quite like how they were handled in the film. None of them were force fed to you and they play out naturally over the course of the film so it feels very natural. The film does incorporate some humour but pretty much all of it is suited for young kids, there isn't much for older audiences and that is a real shame coming from a studio like Pixar. And even then, there wasn't much in this film that even kids will find particularly humorous. There were a few moments that were very cute, but no real laugh out loud funny moments that would get the whole audience laughing. As i mentioned, the biggest thing wrong with this film was the lack of originality and a plot that was very basic for Pixar's standards, and something we had seen in other films. The film hits a lot of the same plot points as other animated films, most notably, 'The Lion King'. And i'm not talking about a few scenes that were reminiscent of events in 'The Lion King', i'm talking about 3/4 of this film pretty much being a semi- reboot of the iconic 1994 film. There were so many parallels to draw between the films that it honestly did seem very lazy because they had to know whilst writing this that it was strikingly similar to 'The Lion King'. Not everything in the first 3/4 of the film is taking from Simba's adventures as there are scenes and sequences and events that occur that does differentiate the two. But overall, as a main concept it hits many of the same beats and did make me lose interest at times because i felt like i had seen this before just with more interesting characters and more depth to the story. In the end, 'The Good Dinosaur' is a very average film and a step down when you consider the quality of Pixar's other memorable films. Kids will get a lot more out of it than adults, i hope.... as the humour for a wider audience isn't really there. The many similarities to 'The Lion King' for me was a huge strike against the film but i managed to still come out of it having seen a decent/average movie. - 6.2","

"braddugg","8 September 2016","A touching homecoming adventure of a Dinosaur.Like in most Pixar films, there are moments that are heart wrenching, touching, exciting and endearing. In the good dinosaur, there are a lot of such moments thankfully. The dull moments are spared and the editing of making this just 93 minutes feature helped I believe. The film is a thrilling adventure that has a lot of family values and emotional substance. In storytelling, this may quite not match up with the Pixar standards but in visual appeal, it surpasses Pixar's own standards. Technically, this film is just brilliant.The visual effects are pleasing to the eye and the music pleased my ears. So, it was a great time for my eyes and ears and I liked it. Music by Mychael Danna can be worth hearing independently too, and it has a universal appeal. Just loved the score of this film.The visual effects, the choice of colors, the depiction of natural elements and the dinosaurs itself, are all treat to the vision. It's a great feat in terms of achievement in the animation industry, I fell for the visual aspect of the film and happy to have seen the film in a theater in 3d.The writers, I wish had written or shown us a tighter story. Some elements were let loose and the film would have been better even without them. But I can easily spare them, coz they are tough for a couple of minutes in this 93-minute feature, making 91 minutes totally worth the time.Thanks to Peter Sohn to give us this film. We are happy about this and I felt to be lucky to have caught this in theaters.It' a 4/5 for this film. Nice one, that should be watched for a good film experience.Also, a special mention about the short film ""Sanjay's Super Team"". This is awesome and indeed, the best-animated shorts I saw in a long long time. The animation work done for the short film is amazing and being an Indian, I was proud what I saw. Thanks to the director Sanjay Patel for this.","

"JakeBrinkman","19 February 2020","I'm a big dinosaur nerd, so I'm probably rating this 1 star higher than it deserves, but even though it isn't Disney/Pixar's most powerful film, it's certainly worth watching.The story is a good one, but it would feel all too familiar if it weren't for the film's unique alternate dimension. It's very interesting to think that, without the mass extinction, the dinosaurs might be more mentally advanced than humans. This made the dinosaurs remarkably human, and the animalistic human was a hilarious and charming treat. Despite the new take, the story is too well-worn to evoke a profound emotional response, which settles the story as a good one rather than great.The non-character animation was breathtaking. Water, dirt, tree bark, and other such details were unbelievably intricate. At first, I wondered if Pixar would continue this trend of astoundingly realistic animation, but I quickly realized why they usually stay away from it. Realistic animals are not easily capable of drawing emotional attachment from an audience, so the cartoonish style is preferred for many of Disney/Pixar's stories. However, the cartoon dinosaurs stood out distractingly from the nearly tangible background. Not to worry, it wasn't a constant distraction because I quickly adjusted to the style as the story began, and I was seriously impressed to see Pixar flexing their animation prowess.","

"injenuity","30 April 2020","I love this movie. It's tough and it's rough. But so is the environment and the landscape, the dinosaurs, the animals, and the ""critters"".
The colors are muted and more earth tones. Like the Mountains and the river.
The animation is different than any movie Pixar has done before. However it's beautiful and it is true.
I don't feel it's ""fair"" to this movie or any other movie to compare how good one is over another. Apples and oranges.
I love the relationship between Spot and Arlo. I love how Arlo grew in his inner strength and bravery through his journey home.
I love the relationship with the T-Rex family (?!?!) and how the older one taught him about working through fear. I love the message of the movie, that fear and anxiety does not need to cripple you. You can be afraid and still do brave things.
My kids love this movie. I love this movie. I recommend it to everyone. Watch it again or for the first time.","

"gavinp9","2 January 2018","'The Good Dinosaur' is a fun kid's movie that has a few strenuous moments, but I saw it with a five-year-old and she was fine, so its PG rating for ""some scenes may scare young children"" is probably fair. Fairly simple plot - the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago just misses Earth, hence allowing mammals & dinosaurs to evolve and coexist.The story follows Arlo (Ochoa), an Apatosaurus, and his anthropomorphised family, of which Arlo's the runt of the siblings. Wright & McDormand are mum & dad, who spend their time farming. Arlo falls in the river and gets swept away and begins a quest to get back home and is aided by an unlikely partner - Spot (Bright) the human, who's really more of a puppy! Plenty of similarities to 'The Adventures of Milo and Otis' and 'The Lion King', with Arlo having to find his own courage before he can find his family.There's actually not that many dinosaurs (a few T Rex, Pteranodons, Velociraptor and Triceratops) as the film really sticks with Arlo & Spot. The backdrop they're set against, which looks like the mountains of Canada, is superb, with all the scenery seemingly vividly real - truly exceptional CGI, with the only things looking cartoony are the characters! Some sad bits, some funny bits and some lessons for good measure.","

"mafiosa2309","12 December 2015","First of all I would like to ask: Those who have rated this film less than 5, what film have you watched? This film is full of characters, emotions ( I'm 27 and I laughed and cried while watching this film), spectacular scenery and a deep message.I am not a person who writes reviews but when I saw what people wrote for this film it made me think twice on watching it, good thing I followed my idea of: I Will Make My Own Mind if I like it or Not. And believe me when I say, I'm extremely happy to have gone to the cinema and watched it. SO I had to write this. This IS a Pixar film, a film with animated characters that suck you in to the story; a film where situations appear unexpected which makes you feel for those beings. DO NOT READ or TAKE TO HEART the previous reviews, THIS FILM is made both for Kids and for adults. The screening that I went to was filled with 3 to 8 year old kids where they all asked questions in different situations while watching happy and excited their new favourite animated characters. Finally I want to say: No matter the review always go and watch it to make your own mind. This IS a film to watch and I will be watching it again.","

"Bravesfan17","6 December 2015","Pixar has finally come back to its originality that made it so great with Inside Out earlier this year, and continues to do so with its newest flick, The Good Dinosaur. We start out millions of years ago, seeing the a meteor floating through space, and it seems to be coming for Earth. But the meteor passes over Earth completely, and we see what it would be like if dinosaurs never died. Fast forward to millions of years later, where we two dinosaurs start a family with three children of their own: Libby, Buck, and Arlo. They all run a farm together, and all have their way of contributing. We see Arlo most of the time, where he is assigned a new job of stopping the culprit who has been stealing the family's food. The culprit is caught, but Arlo is afraid of the small human, who runs off. Arlo catches up to the human boy, but can't find his way back home. The story becomes all about the relationship between Arlo and the human boy known as Spot, as Arlo grows in his experience being lost and away from home. Pixar continues to prove their capabilities at tugging at the heartstrings of the audience here, especially with their own version of a popular and sad Disney moment. Thanks to the efforts of director Peter Sohn, Pixar shows their uniqueness and originality with the stories they tell. The music is definitely the one of the two standout technical aspects of this film. Composers Mychael and Jeff Danna make some moving and emotional music that fits well and weaves into each scene quite nicely. The other standout technical aspect is the beautiful scenery here. So many of the shots felt real, and the filmmakers did a beautiful job of capturing such great places in nature. All of the voice performances were good, but there were two that stood out to me most. One is one of the most recognizable voices out there in Sam Elliott as the voice of Butch, a T-Rex and father of two who looks after Arlo after Arlo helps out the T-Rex's. The other is Steve Zahn as Thunderclap, a vulture who makes it clear he enjoys it when storms come.",NA

"justinmsheetz","25 July 2020","Honestly though the plot is sort of all over the place and feels almost pointless. This movie tries to bring up the theme of conquering fear, but there is an awful lot of depression here. With the cheesy western t-rexes and awfully predictable story, I can't see much good in this movie besides the animation (of the scenery, not so much the characters). I guess it was cute at times.",NA
"EthanBJones_03","22 July 2017","'THE GOOD DINOSAUR' was directed by Peter SOHN and stars Raymond OCHOA, Jack BRIGHT and Steve ZAHN. ​Luckily for young Arlo, his parents (Jeffrey Wright, Frances McDormand) and his two siblings, the mighty dinosaurs were not wiped out 65 million years ago. When a rainstorm washes poor Arlo (Raymond Ochoa) downriver, he ends up bruised, battered and miles away from home. Good fortune shines on the frightened dino when he meets Spot (Jack Bright), a Neanderthal boy who offers his help and friendship. Together, the unlikely duo embark on an epic adventure to reunite Arlo with his beloved family.When I say this movie is a technical marvel, I genuinely mean that. I recommend the movie purely to witness the masterwork that is the animation and cinematography because that is where this movie thrives.Pixar is known for two things: stunning animation and brilliant story. As stated prior, it achieves the first part 10 fold, it is in the latter where this falters. Pixar plots have mostly been very well written and contain a great moral. Toy Story, Up, Finding Nemo, Inside Out etc - all these movies have fantastic plots and morals and all of them are at least good movies. Plot is where this movie fails.Expanding on that point is the lack of a strong moral in this movie. Ratatouille teaches that every dream is possible and Inside Out teaches that sadness is a valid emotion. The Good Dinosaur dabbles in the admirable concept that fear is a valid thing. And that is something I would definitely be behind. Alas, they abandon this moral swiftly after it is established and that seems counter productive to me. I am very disappointed by Pixar here. It may be my fault for having high standards but I don't think that that is down to me, and more down to Pixar's previously consistent quality.Raymond Ochoa was perfectly passable as Arlo but passable is where it ends. He doesn't shine and he is pretty much the only real character in the film. Combine that with a poorly written character and you have a lack of sympathy from me. Jack Bright's performance is impossible to give a proper critique on due to its nature thus I wont comment on it much. I can, however, comment on the character he portrayed. Spot was a very entertaining character and can probably create a few laughs but he lacks a driving force to make him compelling. Granted, a lack of the ability to speak can stump a character's growth but I still didn't feel a connection to him at any point and that is definitely an issue for the film; I did not care.I should do a full segment on the villain but Steve Zahn's 'Thunderclap' was so weak and disappointing that I just had to google the character's name. My time is best spent on other aspects of the film so all I will say is the villain is awful.Side characters, such as Sam Elliot's Butch or Jefferey Wright's Poppa, were fine and interesting enough but they merely served as plot points and thus had negative time to blossom.I want to praise this movie because it definitely excels in some aspects. It is a masterpiece of technical film making. If you want evidence of it, just google 'The Good Dinosaur Water' and find a YouTube video of it. It is beautiful and magnificent to behold. I am happy I saw it just because of how spectacular the animation is for this movie and I recommend it entirely for that. Combine this amazing animation with jaw dropping cinematography and you have a technical masterpiece.This movie is pretty funny and I laughed at a few jokes. I will at least give it that. But a good animated film will include both good humour and good heart. This movie lacks true heart and emotion. They try REALLY hard to squeeze emotion out of me, and I have previously been happy for Pixar to milk money out of my eyes but this time it didn't work. The blatant and non-ironic use of Disney clichés make this movie just seem like it is trying to evoke emotion and that just doesn't work. Disconnection to the characters means I don't care about their fate and that means I can't enjoy a film. A conclusion is just as important as the journey, but if the journey is weak; the conclusion is meaningless.I do recommend this movie. As much as I critiscise it, it is one of those rare movies I can recommend purely for one aspect of it. I'll rate the movie 5 'DEBBIEs' out of 10 and a fair recommendation. Just don't expect Pixar to be at the height of its' power.",NA
"dilipbts","29 April 2020","This film tells the story of a cowardly young dinosaur, who lost his way home after a storm. He befriends a young human being in prehistoric times. They navigate the treacherous lands in search of their respective homes.The visuals in the film are quite stunning. The colours are vivid and bright, while the backdrop is always beautiful and at times even breathtaking. It's interesting to see a talking dinosaur, while the young human being behaves more like a dog, which is further reinforced by the name spot. I enjoyed the exciting and on occasion dangerous adventure they share together. It's an inspiring story to help children and adults find courage to conquer difficult times.",NA
"blaudruk","5 March 2016","Yes, I'm a grown ass man and I love Pixar movies. There, I said it. I can't help it. They make me giggle like Bieber and cry like Kanye. That being said, let's see if The Good Dinosaur is actually euhgood.The Good Dinosaur?So what if, 65 million years ago, that one colossal asteroid missed Earth by a hair's breadth and didn't drive the dinosaurs to extinction? Obviously this would lead to dinosaurs working as farmers -duh- and humans still walking on all fours. Our main dino, Arlo the Apatosaurus (giraffe dinosaur), is the youngest member of an agrarian family of five. He's weak, small and afraid of anything that moves. But when a cruel twist of fate leaves him stranded and alone in the wild, he has no choice but to team up with an unlikely -not really- ally and try to get back home.The Mediocre Dinosaur?It's no secret that this project has had some speed bumps on its way to the audience. It took Pixar six years of development, several changes in both script and cast and even a different director to finally get it released. Unfortunately it really shows in the movie.Firstly, I want to give props to Pixar for the animation of the background scenery because it is straight up stunning. I seriously had some doubts there for a moment whether I was watching an animated or a live action movie. So kudos for that. Sadly, the same can not be said of the character's design. They looked underdeveloped and bland, like they were developed bywell anyone other than Pixar. The contrast in animation is so noticeable that the characters almost look out of place in this realistic environment. Even more so once you see the tragic experiences they go through.Which brings us to the story that is, again, very inconsistent. The first act, watching Arlo's struggle to fit in with his family, is a downright snooze fest. It looks like whoever was in charge couldn't be bothered anymore so they handed over the reins to their janitor for a while. No offense, Scruffy. After that, the movie wakes you up with a scene that is awfully similar to a certain Disney classic – you'll know- and the adventure finally takes off. Now this is the part where the movie shines. Arlo's reluctant teamup with a human kid, called Spot, provides us with some very genuine and heartfelt moments that belong right up there with Pixar's best. Some of them involving: a hilarious blow-a- mole -what?- game; having a psychedelic trip after eating some rotten fruit; and a heartbreaking scene with just sticks and sand. Other than that, the remainder of the movie is a patchwork of story lines they don't follow through and characters you'll forget about before you finish your Diet Coke.ConclusionThe Good Dinosaur is a bit what disappointment looks like, this movie performs so inconsistently that it makes you wonder if it's actually the same movie. Had it been any other studio I would have dubbed it as an okay, fine movie. But that's the cross of being a Pixar production, this was definitely the most mediocre movie they have brought out since Brave –we do not talk about 'Cars' in this house-. Like my parents always tell me, I expect more .But in the end it is still a family movie. Kids will love the silly action and the jokes that go over their heads, will keep the adults interested. The good moments in this film are few and far between but when they do show up, you'll be reminded of why you still claim to buy movie tickets just because your little sister wanted to go. And that's just fine.How to watch? -not as bitter old man; on any screen Score: 6,5/10For more reviews, visit www.blaudruk.org©blaudruk",NA

"jawneyfloros","19 November 2018","Review: I would have preferred this movie stay a classic cartoon style like many of Disney or Disney based movies. The Computer Generated Images or CGi really ruined this movie for me because as someone a bit older CGI in most cases is too new for me to enjoy. The direction and screenplay were good but the animation really ruined it for me because I couldn't follow any of it and struggled to really enjoy it. The casting and acting were pretty good. All in all I would give this zero out of a possible five stars.",NA
