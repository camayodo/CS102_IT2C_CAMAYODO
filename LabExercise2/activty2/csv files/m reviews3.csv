"anon1mat0","16 December 2006","How to describe a movie based on a lovely book, that could have had a wonderful franchise, but was so hurriedly done, and so poorly directed as to become a horrible flop? First lets say that while the book has some flaws, this movie is really a disservice to it; a more or less complex plot is reduced to its bare elements making it a very predictable ordeal (as any other story would), the photography doesn't reach the standard set by LOTR or HP, becoming quite bland, the casting -while good on the stronger characters (Brom, Durza, Galbatorix)- is really lacking, particularly on critical characters like Murtagh and Arya, and the music -so critical to convey the emotions of the movie- is so corny and clumsily placed that rather than enhance takes away from the experience. So little works on this movie and so many details are ruined using the cheapest tricks, that any sequel would never make it to the big screen (more so when critical plot points were stripped from the movie).Having read and enjoyed the books with my 11 year old son, we had high hopes and were both devastated with this ... thing promoted as a movie.It is indeed a sad, sad adaptation, a proof that some movie execs in its eagerness to make a quick buck have indeed killed what could have been a geese of golden eggs.Hopefully Mr. Fangmeier will go back to do special effects and never return as a movie director. At least I know that I will never see a movie made by him again.","

"mrs-mcmanus","20 December 2006","I tell my students to call it as they see it. If someone would be crushed by a scathing review, so be it. These Hollywood ""hotshots' need to get the hint that the public expectations for a true representation of a best-selling novel are more important that their ""artistic vision."" And when I say ""artistic vision,"" I mean stupidity and downright ignorance. Paolini's Eragon did not sell the way it did because it was merely some pulp fiction about a dragon; rather, it sold because it has a strong storyline, compelling characters, and timeless message. Not to mention that it was written by a 16 year-old boy.The most egregious evils lay within the following three reasons. First, as it is, the entire film is told as exposition. Perhaps this was done purposefully; after all, this is the first installment of a trilogy. However, it should be a complete story regardless. The writer tells the viewer what is going on, rather than showing the viewer what is supposed to happen. It's like writing a paragraph with only statements and leaving out the 3-5 sentences of elaboration for each. It is the worst kind of highlight paper. Truly by the end of the film, you are only waiting for the story to begin. But honestly, by the end of the movie, you just want to be put out of your misery. Second, the characters are static and boring. The viewer gets no sense of emotional depth to any of the characters. By limiting the character development, the trilogy itself is severely limited. By the time the film reached the final battle scene, instead of empathizing with the characters, I laughed at them. The music told me that I should feel excitement, frustration, and even sadness, but all I could do was laugh. The laughter was uncomfortable and verging on hysteria (I was deeply wounded by this film), but it was laughter nonetheless. For example, when Eragon wakes after the final battle is won, he looks upon Murtagh's friendly and sympathetic countenance. Eragon asks if Saphira is all right and Murtagh replies, ""Some friends can never be replaced"" Leading the viewer to think that Saphira may be dead. Eragon is clearly distraught, and at this point, as a viewer, you should be crying. But in a whirlwind, Saphira appears, and Murtagh happily proclaims something like, ""But luckily, they don't have to!"" And at that point, I started laughing. A loud, raucous laugh came out of me and I had no control over it. I thought, ""Gee, that Murtagh! He sure is a practical joker- he almost had me there!"" Because, you know, that's what pals do: they pretend that their friend's best friend has died, and then they can have a good laugh over it. Ha ha! Yeah, right. The viewer has no sense of the camaraderie between these characters because at the end of the film, we still don't even really know who they are, much less have a sense of their relationship to one another. Third, as a result of the previous two reasons, the story has no message worth telling. The novel is infused with themes about friendship, tolerance, caring, and justice; however, each becomes lost in this nightmare that Fang-who-ever had wrought. It is the most severe of all sins, as this film will be more widely accessible and distribute than the novel itself. For all those who walk out of the theater thinking this movie was good, whether or not they have read the novel, they are being deceived. They are being deceived into thinking that this garbage is all that this novel is or could be. With The Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson proved that a significant novel with a clearly defined fantasy world can be made with thoughtfulness, grace, and beauty. Eragon, the movie, contains none of those ideals. With a poorly written script by Peter Buchman, widely known for his work on War Magician and Jurrasic Park 3 (Did anyone even see that?), and slipshod production values, the film falls flat on it's face. All good stories leave the reader with something to think about, but this one just left me thinking, ""I paid $9 for this?""True, the novel is a significant work that should be made into a film. However, I can't see how, in the universe that has been created by the filmmakers, that the full trilogy can be told with any vestige of the original story arc. What this Fangmeier moron has done is a true disservice to Paolini, the Inheritance trilogy, the fans and general public, and most significantly, himself. This is his directorial debut, and it is a pathetic interpretation. Something amazing could have been done here. But what I saw was a lazy and wretched re- working of a story that should have simply been told as it was written. For this, as a teacher, I must give Stefen What's-his-name and his entire production crew an F because his work was off-topic and irrelevant.","

"littlejimmy835","20 December 2006","3/10 To put it simply, Eragon lacks. The story is rushed unexplained and poorly thought out, the acting is below par, and the cinematography is annoying with its tilted angles and range so close to the action so that you can't see what is going on.The writing of the movie is by far its weakest aspect. The story is rushed quickly jumping from one thing to the next without any plot development so the viewer is left constantly wondering what is going on, one second our main character is a naive farmer, the next he is suddenly a fully experienced warrior with absolutely no evidence showing exactly where he gained this experience from. Entire scenes of the movie plod along with absolutely no meaning or relevance to the story, scenes which should have been cut out of the movie to make the narrative flow better. Characters come and go as they please with no relevance to the story, such as the archer who just suddenly appears out of nowhere and then just aimlessly follows the main characters without actually adding anything to the story. It almost seems as if the movie was written by a 9th grade high school student for his English class.The acting of the movie is far below par, as it seems that nobody in this movie seems to have emotions as if all the characters were cyborgs from the Terminator series or Steven Segal. For example there is the scene where the main character discovers that the stone he has found isn't a rock but actually a dragon egg as the egg hatches. Now normally people seeing a small monster burst out of a rock would express quite some level of surprise or shock, but all our star does is raise his eyebrows slightly and give a pathetic tiny gasp. Every character in the entire movie is like this, if someone is crying over a slain comrade all they do is frown and have a look of ""dang it"" on their face, if someone is cheering over victory, all they do is leer and go ""woooo"". The emotion is non existent.Eragon is a poor movie at best that fails to be entertaining, especially when compared to the other movies it is copying they style of such as ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter"". It seems that the makers of this movie thought, ""This movie has swords, magic, old English style speech, horses and dragons, it therefore must be good"". They were wrong. The belief that just because your movie looks a bit like ""Lord of the Rings"" it must be good like it, is incorrect.","

"Birstyjr","15 December 2006","The movie follows nothing of the book's plot line. I think someone read like maybe ten chapters of the Eragon book and decided to make the movie. If they decide to make Eldest (The sequel to Eragon) it would be nothing like the book because they have changed too many things in this movie to carry the plot correctly. The plot of the movie shares nothing with the book and the characters (the ones they actually decided to add) share no similarities to the book's idea of them. The storyline used in the movie could have possibly been acceptable if it hadn't had such bad writing. The lines were mediocre and no one other than Brom, Eragon and Saphira had ten lines. Murtagh had like eight or nine lines through the whole movie, Nasuada and Ajihad had like two or three (and Nasuada doesn't say who she is) and Hrothgar had maybe one or two lines. They completely rushed the movie too quickly. Unless you read the book, you have no idea how Eragon learns to use magic and are left in the dark about most things. The actors did the best job they could with the horrid lines they were given to read. The special effects were great except that Saphira isn't supposed to have feathers. What dragon has feathers? Christopher Paolini says like fifty times in the book that Saphira's wings are a thin membrane. Also that Eragon is fifteen, not seventeen. Every problem comes back to the horrid writing. Bottom Line: Could have been a great and timeless movie. Not Lord of the Rings worthy.","

"damir-zupanic1","25 December 2006","When I first heard that a movie is going to be made by the book ""Eragon"" by Christopher Paolini, I must say I was very delighted, and I was even more delighted when I heard that Stefen Fangmeier will be the director. I have read the book, and thaught:""What a great movie this is going to be"". Unfortunately, I was wrong. First of all, I would dare to say that half of the events that happened in the book weren't shown in the movie at all(reason: Lord of the Rings has less then 400 pages and the movie lasts around 3 hours; Eragon has around 500 pages and it lasts around hour and a half). As a result, instead of complexed, unpredictable fantasy plot you get simple, one-way heading fairy tale. Characters that play very significent role in book(like Murtagh, Ajihad and Angela) are hardly even mentioned in the movie, so that it becomes centered on pretty much only 3 characters-Eragon, Saphira and Brom. Villains and locations lack imagination, so they look cheap and ordinary. Choice of actors is, in my opinion, good, except Edward Speleers. There are way too much ""memorable quotes"" in the movie, so that movie becomes kind of too much theatrical.Everybody, from director to actors failed, but still, I personally bealive that the biggest failure is Peter Buchman, screenwriter. Although he had a fantastic material to work on, he managed to ruin it, and make a pathetic screenplay from a fantastic bestseller. Only bright side of the movie is always top-of-the-class John Malkovich(King Galbatorix), pretty solid performance by Jeremy Irons (Brom), but most of all dragon Saphira (voice by Rachel Weisz, whose vocal abilities are on very desirable level)","

"FlaviusAetius","25 March 2007","What happens when you take an unoriginal, crappy, but popular book and make it into a movie? An unoriginal, crappy, but popular movie? Yes, yes, and no. Even Paolini's rabid fan-base caught wind of the pungent stench of this heap, and failed to turn it into the blockbuster it was projected to be.Eragon, an unassuming farm-boy, has his world turned upside down the day he receives a dragon egg, making him a Dragon Rider whose destiny is to battle the evil king Galbatorix(played by an epically bored John Malkovich). To Eragon's aid is the tragically wasted Jeremy Irons as Brom, the wise old swordsman who guides him on his adventures.What's wrong with this movie? Where to start.....the acting is stiff and wooden at best, the plot is a hackneyed rip-off of Star Wars, there's absolutely no interest in the characters, the editing is horrible, making the movie feel like a clumsily-taped together montage of disconnected images rather than a single flowing work, and the action scenes are far too quick and amazingly boring. The characters from the book are mere cameos and are confined to only a few lines of dialog before being shoved off the rim of the abyss into obscurity, allowing the Gary Stu hero of the Inheritance series to take his rightful place at the spotlight once more to soak up attention like a malefic sponge.Ed Speelers is ghastly as Eragon, who can't seem to muster emotion even when his uncle dies. (Boo-hoo.) Deus ex Machina riddles every foul hole and rat-infested crevice of this corrupt beast of a film. My friend and I made a running joke of looking at the sky and thanking God whenever one of the Deus ex Machinas reared their ugly heads. There's simply no end to why this movie fails at nearly every fundamental level. When the plot stutters and staggers, some random, arbitrary element is injected into the mix to keep things moving.Example: The epic siege of Farthen Dur ends with Eragon victorious. Pretty much the end of the movie: what do we do now? We have to establish a basis for the sequel! ""LOL! LESSGO TO ELESSMERA!"" Whatever the hell that is.Good things: well, the scenery was beautiful. I don't know where they shot it, but it sure was nice. Of course, there are plenty of far superior movies that show equal-if-not better scenery(coughLordoftheRingscough). The special effects were spotty but were nice in spots. Jeremy Irons is by far the best actor in the movie (Rachel Weisz does an admirable job with voice work as well.) He manages to bring depth to a one-dimensional character, and refuses to go down without a fight even with his limp co-cast and a horrible script. Unlike John Malkovich, who can finally boast he's given a performance as bad as Shadow of the Vampire was good, he refuses to phone his performance in.All in all, Eragon barely counts as a movie. Will there be a sequel? Hopefully not.","

"AZINDN","21 December 2007","Eragon (Ed Speleers) is a young farmer who discovers an egg one day. When the egg hatches, out pops a baby dragon who the human learns is his dragon, and that he is a Dragon Rider. Through the inevitable growing pains of child to youth, youth to adult, young Eragon is mentored by a former dragon rider, Jeremy Irons, and learns that dragons and their human rider are bound together by a shared destiny until death. How they choose to live this partnership is the gist of the story as Eragon seeks to save his country from an evil ruler and magician with the help of a band of rebel outcasts, a magic sword, and the brave dragon. Of course, a young beautiful girl, Sienna Guillory is the first love of Eragon, and the partnership of Safira, the dragon and her rider becomes a life's test of courage, cunning, and growing wisdom.This is a light fantasy film that is most of all feel-good with a smattering of ""ancient"" wisdom and swordplay which will entertain younger audiences. The special effects and overall look of the film is passable, not a multi-million dollar SFX laden film, but believable in its visuals. As for the story, I don't read fictional fantasy so I had no basis for comparison with ""the book."" But, I'm not a fan of comparing text to visuals as criterion for quality or authenticity for each medium is its own separate art form. This is a family film that will entertain and enthrall youngsters as well as possibly impart some sense of honor, wisdom through purpose, and a sense of duty above self -- all characteristics that are missing in the mindless, fart-heavy humor of most ""tweeny"" movies put out for commercial distribution today.If only to watch the stellar performance of the excellent British actor, Jeremy Irons as he mentors the wet-behind-the-ears Dragon Rider, the film is worth watching as the really ugly bad guys try to bring down the last of the dragons and her headstrong partner.","

"fisherd","21 December 2006","Formula for disaster ..... take a rookie director whose reputation is as a CGI/FX whiz kid, an unknown screen writer, a cast that looks fantastic on paper, but embodies nothing of the original characters and has to deliver the schlock that before mentioned screenwriter has written, and then attempt to set to film once of the most anticipated book adaptations in recent history. It fails on so many levels.I DID read the book, but have the sense to know that film doesn't have to completely follow the book word-for-word/chapter-for-chapter. I am not one of the fanatics raving that the movie sucks because Arya is blonde or doesn't have ""elf ears"". I am saying the movie sucks for all the reasons already mentioned ad nauseum .... because the pacing is deplorable, the dialog is beyond bad, and the directing is cliché. I thought that the effects were actually quite good -- Duza's makeup, aside. One questionable costume design was Arya's ""Indian Princess"" costume in the last scene. She looks like an extra from some 40's western.To sum, the director and screen writer should be tarred and feathered, but only after the studio execs who green-lighted this turd are drawn and quartered. Too many fans had too many expectations for something FAR better than this.","

"FiendishDramaturgy","25 March 2007","Good thing I'm not a fan of the novel, then. I realize there are problems with this adaptation, but I must agree with other reviewers in that this story was obviously a total rip off of the base Star Wars plot, with a medieval setting tacked on, in the first place, so I don't CARE that this particular movie wasn't like the book. In fact, I found that a plus.The characters were enigmatic, unlike the written work. The dragon was awesome, unlike the written work. All the idiotic nonsensical details which did not mesh with one another were absent, and the story was amazingly coherent, considering the source material from whence this was drawn.I thoroughly enjoy this work, and will watch it again, and again. The book? I couldn't stand the amateurish lack of style, the lack of demonstration of vocabulary, or the inability to string together a coherent paragraph. Sorry book fans. I hated the book. When I read others' reviews screaming how NOT like the book this was, I bought the DVD sight unseen, and LOVED it.It rates an 8.6/10 from...the Fiend :.","

"qlawman","19 December 2006","I registered with IMDb for the sole purpose of reviewing this movie.It is an atrocity, and I mean that in every conceivable connotation of the word.If you have not read the book, than you might give a 5, but even then it does NOT deserve it. I'd say, at it's very best and if I wouldn't have read the book that this movie would rate a 3.There wasn't a single transition in the whole thing; the plot just kept on hopping from point to point leaving the audience in a constant state of confusing frustration. Or, at least, it might have been confusing had the movie kept any of the intricacies of the original plot as outlined in the novel. One second Brom and Eragon are happily sparring along a river, when mere seconds before, and close by(as the audience is led to assume) a group of Urgals (which have been morphed into fat, bald men with blue tattoos) were ravaging some poor group of people on the side of the road. Eragon, whom is constantly portrayed in the movie as having ""1 part courage and 3 parts fool"" doesn't seem to care. What a big heart.That's just one example. Suffice to say, my 15 month old niece could have done a better job at producing this movie. It is ALMOST as bad as Battlefield Earth! Heck, it's right on par with Bloodrayne.It is an insult to call this a ""B Movie"" as I have seen a few good ""B Movies"" in my time. This movie kind of falls off the grading-scale charts. It's bad.They skipped so many intrinsic plot points that they couldn't possibly make Eldest into a movie and call it ""Eldest."" For one thing, there is no love interest for Roran, and he just up and leaves because ""he's of age."" What's Roran going to do throughout the entire second book? Arya is not an elf...the least they could have done was throw on some tapered ears...so if Arya doesn't look or act super-human, what difference would Eragon's transformation be in the next book. Eragon does not get scarred from the shade, and Murtagh's scar is some tribal looking scratch.Christopher Paolini should be insulted, and whoever is responsible for this nonsensical ""interpretation"" should be arrested and forced to watch their own horrid movie over and over again for a span of at least 10 years.Yeah, I know I'm coming off a bit harsh, but I can't impress upon you enough that this was a huge let-down. I just hope that this serves to help some of you save some money by avoiding this movie. As another reviewer implied, you will find this DVD in bargain bins in a couple of weeks and will probably be able to buy it online cheaper than you could rent it in a store. Just wait until then","

"moviemaniac008","7 March 2007","Like many people think, Rachel Weisz was not the only one to give an interesting performance. You see, I found Djimon Hounsou, Jeremy Irons and Edward Speleers interesting. But I found Sienna Guillory a bit unconvincing at the beginning, still, her performance was incredible for the rest of the movie. I have found many coincidences on star wars and that movie: Brom is an Obi-Wan, Eragon is an Anakin Skywalker, Dragons replace spaceships. And many more! But find them by yourself. I really liked the battle sequences, though many people found them unrealistic. I thought they warmed up the movie a little. Anyways, this movie was great and I recommend it. I was one of the first ones to buy the DVD. I like it! (But I don't have the 2 disc edition, so I think they should have put more extras in). Great film! P.S: Baby Saphira was too cute!","

"goddessngirl","16 December 2006","First of all, the movie starts with Arya and the egg. But the narrator explains about who she is which eliminates the whole mystery of her character right off. There was no character development at all. Eragon is totally downplayed in the beginning and Roran is there and then just gone. Brom was portrayed as a cranky old man instead of the compassionate story teller. I must say though, that Saphira's period of growth was clever and Saphira, herself, was fantastic. But, none of the characters had personality. Speaking of the characters' personality, it wasn't ALL the screenwriters fault. What was with Ed Speelers? His rendition of Eragon lacked substance. The battles were immensely cut short. SOOOOOOO much was cut out of the book. And for people with children, it should be rated PG-13 because the battles were pretty graphic and the Ra'zac were really creepy looking. For people who read the book, the movie will make you want to kill the screenwriters. Major things were totally screwed up. Brom didn't even die the way he actually did in the book! Arya was conscious pretty much the whole time so there was no ""oh no she's going to die!"" suspense there. It was pretty lame. I felt nothing for any of the characters throughout the movie because nothing about the movie made me want to care about them. Did Christopher Paolini sell out when the price was high enough? I don't know but I am shocked that a writer would allow his or her book to be demolished in such a disgraceful and mocking creation as this movie. The graphics were good and the music was too, along with the setting and they were the ONLY good things.","

"melanieatkins_1","14 February 2007","I hope i never witness a sequel to this truly abysmal story. It seems like the whole film was put together in a couple of days. The script was dreadful and the acting not much better. When Jeremy Irons dies half way through he must of gave a sigh relief (at least he won't be in the sequel). The Film: A boy (Eragon) of 17 finds a dragon egg which hatches and becomes full sized in a day. The boy has special powers and rushes headfirst into everything without thinking but manages to survive everything thrown at him. None of the characters have any feeling felt towards them it's as if they are wooden characters. You don't really care what happens next. The finale is focused on a dragon fight with a raging battle fought beneath (which you don't see much of). The boy and his Dragon win (I don't know how) and it finishes as such that we will probably see the afore mentioned sequel. I say again what a terrible film trying to be Lord of the Rings but more like Bore of the rings.","

"the_zero_g","30 December 2006","ERAGON was not this totally disgusting movie that you should avoid. It is a very massive rip-off of LOTR and Star Wars (but everyone already knows that); yet it does have a certain level of charm, and the last quarter of the film is quite exciting.There are several problems with ERAGON, and most of them have nothing at all to do with the action or screenplay. If anything, it feels that at least 45 mins of the movie is missing. The story moves ahead far too quickly and doesn't explain anything deeply enough.ERAGON could have used better editing and much stronger character development. Too many people are rushed in and out of the story without really explaining who they are and why they are important. I had a feeling that the best parts of the movie were most likely cut out for time restrictions (often kiddie type films are shaved down to be as short as possible to fit in as many showings in one day as possible for theatres and the studios).Many movies are killed this way. ERAGON was definitely harmed by having so much of the story cut out -- and as someone who read the first book and seen the movie, they cut out way too much and there is much that should have definitely been in there.In any case, this is a good flick for TEENAGERS who enjoy heroic fantasy.","

OK, so the acting was a bit messed up in some parts, but wow the effects and Saphira the dragon were both special and breath-taking. If you have read the book, then maybe you will see this movie as a joke, but if you haven't then you might, like me, find it rather extraordinary. It has something to offer to everyone, not to mention a hot young cast, amazing CGI work and cool set visuals. Plus, the ending, when the Saphira dies is quite emotional, and had a lot of my mates weeping into their popcorn lol. So yes, I would recommend Eragon as a good movie, despite a few flaws, and overall I would say Eragon is spectacular.","

The story line (which skips about 70% of the original story line) wanders miles from the novel. Except for Rachel Weisz's great voice over work for the dragon (which is the best acting this film has) the acting from the rest of the actors is just above high school play level. What were Jeremy and John thinking in taking these roles?

I do give credit to the actors, they did very well for what they were given.

"myrkeyjones","13 December 2006","Its seems that fantasy is the currant rage with motion pictures, what with obviously the hugely successful Lord of the Rings Trilogy and the Great but flawed Chronicles of Narnia adaption, and also Next year the Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig starring Golden Compass Trilogy. Well eragon is entertaining claptrap at best, but as a motion picture it suffers from wooden acting and an very cheesy screenplay. Even some of the effects are low-par. There is also some shocking continuity and plot holes. Is Eragon a cheap rip-job to make some money in the wake of the fantasy craze, yep. With great actor's like John Malcovich, Jeremy Irons and Robert Caryle, you would think that this prestige would satisfy, but their performances are surprisingly wooden. The lead character eragon comes off as a fudged pretty boy. There were so many moments to make fun of, particularly the unintentional gay innuendo in the screenplay. The only light in this film is Sienna Guillory, who does her best to create a competent heroin. Eragon is a great big movie, with no soul. Recommendation: Avoid at best, but makes for a great comedy.","

"saarvardi","11 December 2006","I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by Eragon upon watching it during a special press screening in Ramat Gan, Israel on Sunday, December 10th. After Narnia and Lord of the Rings, it had big shoes to fill and many potentially great fantasy adaptations were (and still are) riding on it's back. If Eragon the movie fails to live up to the aforementioned films' success, the future of fantasy cinema is in question; if the box office receipts are satisfying, the sky is the limit for films of the genre. My two cents - I think the film delivers on mostly all scales and justifies the investment.Everything in Eragon is top notch - starting from the breathtaking scenery and special effects, and unto the (surprisingly good) acting. 19 year-old Edward Speelers actually manages to carry most of the film on his back, despite being rather young and totally anonymous. He has this unique sincerity in his acting I haven't seen in a young actor for a very lone time. Of course, the presence of Jeremy Irons as his aspiring mentor (didn't he play the exact same thing in Kingdom of Heaven?) helps him push through during the first half of the film. John Malcovich's menacing voice as the tormented yet evil King Galbatorix actually managed to send shivers down my spine (kudos, Mr. Malcovich), and the only famous talented I found somewhat disappointing was Rachel Wiesz's take on the dragoness Saphira.The plot tells of a faraway Dungeons and Dragons' like land where legends of dragon riders fighting for peace inspire the weak and weary people. They have been long ruled by King Galbatorix and his devilish army of ghouls and evil sorcerers. But not for long. A young farmer named Eragon finds an intriguing egg while hunting. Soon a tiny dragon hatches (one of the cutest CGI moments you'll ever see on film - I promise) and Eragon is chosen to be it's rider. From here on out Eragon sets on a quest to gather the remaining forces of resistance who oppose King Galbatorix, and save the people, with the help of mentor Brom (Jeremy Irons), Saphira - the last existing dragoness, Arya (Sienna Guillory, ""Love Actually"") and more.Yes, this is your basic (and much clichéd) coming of age story through which a young man must fight to find his way in life, and save the world whilst doing so. You've seen it in some version or another in films like Star Wars IV: A New Hope, the Harry Potter films and others, but if done right - it's always refreshing to see the story told again, from a new and different perspective. Here, you get to see that, along with awesome fight sequences, thrilling special effects and that good old epic feel you get towards the end, as you know you are now part of a new and magical journey. For me, it was a chance to feel like a child again, forget the time and life's other worries, and eat a can of popcorn with my girlfriend as if we were teenagers on our first date. Bottom line - Eragon is an excellent addition to the growing world of fantasy films. I gave it an 8 out of 10.","

"themovieclub","12 December 2006","When Christopher Paolini first wrote the book Eragon, he was only 15. This could be a double-edged sword for split votes between those impressed with his talents and those who criticise at the story's immaturity and lack of depth.The name 'Eragon' is probably derived from 'Dragon'. A fantasy about dragons and magic, it traces the adventure of a farm boy Eragon whose destiny is to save an Empire now that he is the sole dragon rider.The main attraction of the movie should be Saphira, a digital dragon voiced by the talented Rachel Weisz. The dragon emotes sensitivity and strength, and is easily the best 'actress' in the movie. Strange.While fantasy novel fans have great expectation for this year-end blockbuster, criticisms have been forthcoming. It has been said to be a copy of Lord of the Rings, with its scenic backdrop, setting and elfish language. (And Elijah Woods and Ian McKellen were originally considered for the roles of Eragon and Brom). The young Eragon avenging the death of his uncle reminds us of Luke Skywalker from Star Wars. And the use of magical spells, dragons scream and similar soundtrack scream ""Harry Potter"".The story-telling is rather straight forward and predictable with a surprisingly short duration (clocking below 2 hours.) My advice is, try not to draw comparisons of it to Lord of the Rings and you will be more forgiving. Note: Arya (Eragon) is not Arwen (LOTR) even though they feel really alike.Enjoy the dragon ride as you move through an entertaining adventure with breathtaking scenery.http://themovieclub.blogspot.com","

"CrouchingTiger15","14 December 2006","There is certainly something for everyone in this movie. That is, something for everyone to absolutely detest. Personally, I was struck by the horrid acting in this movie. The main characters all seemed to be warming up for the day of shooting in the shots chosen. They're characters were one dimensional at best and 9 times out of 10 they weren't even remotely believable. The best acting came from a poorly CGIed dragon with the completely unbelievable voice of Rachel Weisz.If the acting doesn't kill you, the film-making is next on the list. There are so many lens flares and disgustingly nauseating camera movements that you'll be using your popcorn bag as a barf bag. If I saw another Hitchcock ""dolly and zoom"" (like in Vertigo) I would have very seriously considered walking out of the movie. Those camera movements only have meaning if you use them sparingly and intentionally at key moments. This movie very much represented a film student's first work, when they are eager to try all the tricks, movements, and shots they've seen in great movies before.MINOR SPOILER WARNING BELOWAnd, lastly, if you can see past all of these things, you will not miss the fact that the story is a very blatant mixture of Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. It starts with a princess who has stolen something from the evil ruler and now tries to smuggle it to her hidden base. I was looking for R2D2 and C3PO to appear. We also learn that ""Shades"" can apparently use force strangle like Darth Vader. And of course, there are many Lord of the Rings-like things (elves and dwarfs, Eragon/Aragorn and Aria/Arwen, etc). Some of the shots were even framed identically to shots from Lord of the Rings. END SPOILERSUnfortunately, while this film tries to copy Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, it has nowhere near the storyline, effects, or acting in either of them (including Episode I, so that's pretty bad). Save the money or use it to go see dancing penguins or James Blond playing poker for two hours. Between a horrible script, even worse acting, awkward editing, shaky-at-best camera work, a blatant lack of directing, cheap CGI and other effects, and a pace that drags like a car with both rear tires shot out, this movie bombs. You'll spend more time talking about how bad it is than you will in the theater actually watching it.","

"Wizard-8","31 May 2009","I have not read the Christopher Paolini novel this is supposedly based on, so I don't know if he's the source to blame the major problem I had with this movie. But it's clear that SOMEONE along the way from writing the novel to making this movie had seen ""Star Wars"" too many times. Here's a sample of the evidence (SPOILERS BELOW): (1) There is a youthful protagonist, who lives with his uncle (2) The uncle is killed by troops of the evil empire (3) The youth is mentored by a mysterious and powerful bearded figure, who teaches him the art of special fighting (4) At one point, the youth flies down a narrow trench (5) The bearded mentor is killed during the journey (6) The youth springs a princess from the clutches of the evil empire (7) The youth joins with a band of rebels (8) After the battle, where the evil emperor's prized warrior is defeated, the emperor is still alive and ready to take revenge at the end of the movieIf all this ripping off was done with some energy and a few bursts of originality and wit, it possibly could have been a painless time-waster. But as it is, and with the ""Star Wars"" movies easily available to rewatch, there is absolutely no reason to see this movie.","

"MKeller14-1","22 December 2006","Let me start by saying I didn't read the books before seeing the movie but I am reading Eragon now. I enjoyed the movie. Not great but not bad. One of the most nagging problems with this movie has it was way to short and seemed like it was in fast forward most of the movie. If they would have increased this movie to 2 hours to 2 and a half hours I think it would have been a very good movie (hopefully the DVD will have more added in). The acting by Rachel Weisz was fantastic. Jeremy Irons did a very good for his part. But those are two experienced actors that will give good performances regardless. The CG on Saphira was very well done. The main problem with the acting in this movie was Edward Speleers, he had no presence in this movie, which is a bad thing for the main character. It was all most like he was just there to read his lines and go home. For which I hold the director responsible but it was also one of his first movies. I think Edward would have made a good side character, but someone with more experienced should have been casted as Eragon or a director with more proved talent. If you have never read the book and enjoy good CG you will like this movie. Just change the name of the movie to Saphira and it is OK. If you have read the book assume it is a coincidence that the movie and characters share names.","

"prbach","13 December 2006","What? Peter Jackson wasn't involved with ""Eragon."" Precisely. ""Eragon"" is the latest in the early wake of films following ""LOTR"" to demonstrate Jackson's genius by so completely falling short of it. The folks at New Line just lost a few cool millions in their quixotic efforts to low ball Jackson into directing their planned two-film ""The Hobbit"" series. At this rate New Line will also have to throw down a fiver on a pair of kneepads to prevent bruises while groveling.""Eragon"" suffers from plenty of problems: stilted bland dialogue, characters cut out from Fantasy Film for Dummies, and a predictably rote plot. But its greatest flaw is assuming its target audiencewhich, from its facile storyline, is presumably children whose age is measured in single digitswon't understand the difference between fantasy and reality.The hero, a teen boy aptly named Eragon, must discover his true nature as a dragon rider and the last hope of a poor, abused populace to defeat its evil king. Along his travails he meets the knowing mentor (as played by Jeremy Irons, the only character to avoid one-word characterizations), the mysterious alter-ego lost son, the princess who becomes his inspiration and love interest, and the big ethnic leadership figure (an unfortunately cast Djimon Hounsou) who knowingly lays down arms for our hero.Archetypal figures can be great for a film, but they need a believable existence apart from their characterization. Even young kids can recognize the difference. ""Neverending Story"" and the ""Shrek"" films covered similar territory for the same audience with remarkably richer stories and themes.""Eragon"" is proof positive that it takes more than complicated CGI and monsters (both of which fall short of ""LOTR"" standards, by the way) to craft a good fantasy film. The poor young writer of the novel that forms the basis for ""Eragon,"" Christopher Paolini, hopefully will prevent Fox from messing up his already successful follow up, ""Eldest.""Somebody get Peter Jackson on the phone. Pronto.","

They then made sure that I had the wrong idea based on their own feelings. However, I found the movie(s) to be great, and then went back and read the books to enjoy those too. Give it a chance, but maybe it helps if you don't know what you're missing/if you don't compare the movies purely to the books (they never fully equate in any series I know of, and can still be quality works of art in themselves).","

They team up and band together and free themselves to the beautiful princess (Sienna Gullory) confronting weird monsters and taking on king's tyranny (John Malkovich) .This amazing story attempts at creating a real fantasy but is compromised by borrowing elements from ¨Dragonheart¨, ¨Dragon Slayer¨ and ¨Lord of the Rings¨ and other latter-day movies . Film blends witchcraft and wizardry , adventures , battles and is extremely fun and amusing . Stimulating action set pieces illuminate the full-blown adventures of Eragon and his Dragon . Casting is frankly well , giving enjoyable performances . Convincing special effects by Industrial Light Magic (George Lucas's owner) bring dragon to life with spectacular images . Work on Dragon took more a year and does seem authentic . Patrick Doyle's soaring musical score is wonderful and colorful cinematography by Hugh Johnson . Picture is beautifully made with phenomenal production values and rousing production design in charge of Wolf Kroeger. The motion picture was marvellously directed by Stephen Fangmeier . As of 2015, this remains the first and only film directed by Stefen , who's mostly known for doing visual effects work on Terminator 2 (1991) and Jurassic Park (1993), and as the second unit director on Galaxy Quest (1999) .

"Rainey-Dawn","1 July 2014","A good family styled sword and sorcery film fantasy. It captures all the magic and wonder of finding a dragon's egg, raising the creature and becoming a dragon-rider.The movie is kid-friendly so do not expect to see the most powerful, fearsome dragon that you have ever seen. Saphira is more of an enduring dragon that is hard not to love.Also, just because the movie is a family styled film does not mean the story or the overall visuals are not good. It's quite the contrary, Eragon is a captivating story with beautiful visuals and special effects - it is right up there with the ""Harry Potter"" film series.I enjoyed Eragon and will watch it again one day. 9/10","

"Leofwine_draca","5 February 2011","Based on a popular novel by teenage geek Christopher Paolini, ERAGON turns out to be nothing more than a Tolkien rip-off, featuring many scenes that have been copied from those movies. Those responsible for set design and art direction should be ashamed of themselves. In addition, this is an inferior product in every way, a bland, routine outing that never offers a surprise or twist different from those we've seen before countless times.The story follows the usual ""boy and his pet dragon"" template, mildly enlivened by some good CGI work used to animate the dragon (a shame it's saddled with Rachel Weisz's voice). Ed Speleers, a newcomer to film, is completely wooden as the teenage hero, sapping energy every time he appears on screen. John Malkovich hams it up to an embarrassing degree in his scenes as the villain, Robert Carlyle shows up to get his paycheque, Sienna Guillory is pretty but underused, and character actors like Gary Lewis, Alun Armstrong, Garrett Hedlund and Djimon Hounsou barely register. The only exception is Jeremy Irons, giving a compelling turn as the wise mentor - far better than his appearance in THE TIME MACHINE remake.Weak direction, slow plotting and senseless action sequences only compound the misery, leaving this – as is the case with so many – an utterly forgettable outing with only a few worthless SFX to stop it being a total dog.","

From the ""comments"" I heard while she she was watching she seemed very disappointed in the quality of the acting and the fact that the plot was very different from the books.(If you do not want to know anything about the film do not read on.)For example the film makes out Eragon is in control of the dragon when in the book he is not and does not have details such as dragons fire is the same colour as the dragon.Some of the characters and places in the book were also missed out. For people who have not read the books or have no intention to read them the film seems good in its own right but for anyone who enjoys the books watching the film may be a frustrating experience. I advise anyone wanting to watch Eragon to read the books instead.","

"dramajuana","19 December 2006","I read both Eragon and Eldest, and re-read Eragon the day before I was invited to see the film. A friend of mine works at a theater, so we were able to get free tickets. I was a little wary about the film before I saw it because Eragon looks like he's about 20 (he's 19). In the film, he says he's 17. In the book, it says he's 15. Okay, I can deal with that. However, the order of things bothered me-nothing was in the right order, and the fact that Brom and Eragon only traveled together for like a week. Brom was supposed to be teaching Eragon how to spar and use magic, and things like that, but he just did a lot of yelling. And why could Eragon do magic so well intuitively? They skipped Joed's entire thing, Angela was weird and too young, and Roran left home because they were looking for soldiers? What? They skipped so much that hardly anything made sense. Eragon said (in the book and the movie) that he hardly recognized himself. But the movie didn't allow him to grow at all, since it seemed to have taken place in a week.Problems with order: Brom didn't die until after Arya was rescued (Murtagh is supposed to be with Eragon when Brom dies and help him through it), and Arya helped get Brom out after Durza threw a spear into him (Brom should have been dead at the time, Eragon a prisoner himself, and Murtagh and Saphira were going to rescue HIM and he wanted to rescue Arya.. oh yeah, and Arya was supposed to be drugged and unconscious). Oh, and Gallbatorix didn't want Eragon and Saphira killed; he wants to convince them to join him. Also, at the close of the book, Ajihad is supposed to be dead and Murtagh and the Twins (how could they skip the twins and the testing of Eragon?!) are supposed to be missing (presumed dead). EDIT: Just realized that this is incorrect. That doesn't happen until the beginning of the SECOND book. I'm sorry. I guess I was confused because Arya was leaving, and she doesn't leave in Eragon, the book /EDIT Oh, and why does Arya encourage Eragon's infatuation in the movie? Also, why was Brom so mean? He's supposed to be this secretive mentor who's strict and caring and kind. In addition, Eragon is WAY too full of himself.Oh, a couple more complaints: why did Saphira magically grow in two minutes when she was flying? And what was up with Brom just burning Garrow? And with Eragon just ripping Brom's glove to go ""oh, look. A gedwey ignasia. You're a rider."" Wasn't Brom supposed to reveal that when he was on his death bed? And after he had become like a father to Eragon, instead of an annoying jerk. One thing I DID like (oh my!) was the poetic license taken with Brom dying on Saphira's back. That's totally something she would do.The movie was choppy and I can't imagine that it made sense to anyone, including the people who never read the book. Nothing is explained, and so much poetic license was taken it's not even funny. I can't understand why they didn't take 3 hours to make it make some sense, instead of the measly hour and half. It's not exactly a movie for little children anyway, so they shouldn't have worried about time, and it really could have been great. I was sorely disappointed. I am VERY glad that I did not have to pay to see this movie. If you haven't seen it yet, don't. The book is a great read, and it goes very fast. You won't want to put it down, and you'll be sad that there isn't more when you're done. But then you can read Eldest!","

"SerenityCelest","15 December 2006","So I just went to see the 'Eragon' movie and well...yeah.Here's a copy of the Eragon book*holds up a copy, then proceeds to throw it at the feet of Christopher Paolini, who then pulls down his pants, takes out his family jewels and pisses on the book* And that is what the movie did to it. Seriously though, the movie was one gigantic disappointment ESPECIALLY if you have read the book. They ignored important plot points, revealed secrets that weren't meant to be revealed and completely trod over the entire 'Higher thinking' part of the book, the part that keeps you wondering what happens next and surprises you at every turn. This was pure unfiltered crap, not even worthy of the ranking of 'B' movie. First of all the acting was atrocious, completely ignoring the fact that Eragon is dark-haired with brown eyes, they casted a blond blue-eyed surfer boy as the main character. A Surfer boy, I might add that couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag, I've seen better acting at a third-grade school play. And while they might have chosen Ed Speleers, the 'actor' who played Eragon, for his looks; Garrett Hedlund, Murtagh, was much sexier and one heck of a better actor. However, in the spirit of keeping this movie as horrible as possible he was given almost no screen time, even though he was in more of the book then Brom. Did I mention I really hate this film? Not even Jeremy Irons', Brom, excellent skills as an actor could save this film.The Urgals were nothing more than ugly men who had too much fun with finger paint. The 'Dwaves' were taller than I am, and the Elves had no distinguishing features other then the fact that they were all hired from a Calvin Klein commercial. The entire movie had me wanting to drive to the house of Stefen Fangmeier, the Director, and demand my eight dollars back. If I was Christopher Paolini I would sue, and part of my demand would be that every god awful copy of this piece of excrement movie be completely and utterly destroyed. I never want this film mentioned near me EVER again, I will erase the nastiness of this film with the awesomeness of the books. I mean really there's ""The Book was Better."" and then there's ""WHAT THE @*$# WERE YOU THINKING!!!"" Obviously Peter Buchman and the other writers, never actually read the book, because very little of the original story line survived. So in short if you absolutely must see this movie, I wouldn't recommend paying for it.","

The Special Effects we beautifully done the story was straight to the point and didn't drag on but sometimes very predictable i don't know why people think the acting was hopeless the acting was brilliant especially Robert Carlyle who played Durza The Shade, i thought his portrayal was really good played a very evil man, Ed Speelers i thought was good for a first major picture playing along side Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Robert Carlyle, Rachel Weiz, and Djimon Hounsou would be very nerve racking especially trying to act to their standards, i was even quite surprised to see Australian Actor Chris Egan who played Roran even though he wasn't in it for long it was still good to see him in a movie rather than in Home and Away, Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich two of my favourite actors i thought were good to.So all in all i thought it was good don't know why people don't like this movie so much i just think people should rather just enjoy a movie instead or picking at everything just so they can have an argument, i recommend it to anyone and hopefully there will be a sequel.","

"thebanquet","10 January 2007","When I first heard about the movie Eragon, I immediately ran to a nearby bookstore and bought the original novel and devoured it before going to the theaters to watch the movie,because I thought that the story would be hard to understand given the gap between the book's length and the movie's running time.(I have experienced this while watching Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring) While I was disappointed that the movie cut out some important details and characters, I was astonished with the rest of the film.I don't care what other people think. Some of the harsh reviews that other fellow movie fans wrote cited that Eragon is just another copy from Lord of the Rings. I agree that there are characters similar between the two, yet I think that all modern fantasy novels are influenced by The Lord of the Rings. You can see them in many books, including the world wide known Harry Potter series. So why do people not criticize other fantasy novel movies? Yes, I would have to say that the battle scenes are similar, but nowadays every movie is influenced by one another, so you can't blame the special effects department.(some reviews that reporters in my home country argued with this issue)Yet there is one thing that I have to agree with the anti Eragon movie fans. The special effects and costume,scenery, the acting(Edward Speelers does a much better job than most young actors)are superb, but the storyline and characters have shrunk too much from the original novel. It is all to vast to write, but I was most disappointed with that the Twins(the magicians that envies and jeers Eragon when he joins the Varden)were wiped out, as were Katrina(Eragon's cousin Roran's lover),Jormundur(Ajihad's second in command)and Solembum(the were cat that the fortune teller Angela). Where as the Lord of the Rings trilogy had each at least 150minutes of running time, Eragon has less than two hours, too little for a book over 900pages. But as in every movie that is based on a book,running time can't be blamed with. Although I don't like it, I also understand that it is inevitable to cut lots of scenes if you are going to make a novel into a movie. So I think that Eragon is one of the best, if not the best,book based movie there is.","

"punishterli1","16 December 2006","I must say this movie is horrible. To start things out it would really help if the movie was longer. I mean for a movie made after a 500 page book the movie is very short (130 minutes or so minutes) Next thing that makes this movie bad is the musical score. Most of the time its a happy fanfare which doesn't make much sense because the movie is not all happy. And in a scary moment in the movie in which an elf Arya is getting hurt tortured etc. The music is exciting. The next point is about the realism of the movie. Alright first of all, all of the city's in the Empire (the bad guys in the book and movie) have evil architechure like every building is made of black stone. Now tell me why you would make every city out of black stone in an empire. Sure the empire is evil but there are still people that live there that don't want to but a house made of evil looking black stone. It Looks like a Goth emo Castle instead of Urubaen in the book. My point is that just because people are evil doesn't mean. They live in black devilish citys. Anyway I hope I have made you not want to go see this movie. I could have gone on and on about how bad this movie was but I'd like to spend time doing something else today. Until next time I'm The Punishter, ready to punish any movie stupid enough to be this bad. Peace Out Homies!","

"Grimreaper62292","16 December 2006","Eragon was a entertaining movie, but for those of us who have read the book, beware, this film mixes and matches parts and even takes out entire scenes that take up to fifty pages in the book! This movie was highly rushed and changed how certain things happened so if you hadn't read the book, you could understand what the heck was going on. Though scenes like Teirm and the Hadarc Desert were taken out, they took the information from there and put it other scenes. Scenes were also highly changed, but surprisingly, only about one thing was added in the movie if it wasn't changed. Many characters were dismissed such as Katrina, Salebum (Werecat), Jeod, and the Twins were removed from the movie, they made an excuse by making this movie an hour and forty minutes. It was very rushed and if they added a half an hour to the movie, it could have been much better. I do have comment positively, and that is were the visual effects and acting comes in. The effects were phenomenal! It WAS real. or at least the effects made it look that way. The acting was also amazing. Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich create a strong cast, not to mention the new actors, Ed Speelers, Chris Egan, and Garett Hedlund. Djimon Hounsou created a great Ajihad. If you haven't read the book, this creates a very entertaining movie, but it is a different story than the book, only with the same plot.","

I also went in expecting this movie to be a big dumb action flick, and that is what I got. I'm fine with that. It entertains, the acting was fine, and I thought that it had good graphics. There was nothing bad about it, except that it became uninteresting and mediocre at times. I loved the dragon, for she was of course a lovable character anyway, and even though the main characters did not stand out as much as they should have, they did a good job at building their personalities. It was not a terrible movie, but I really do not think it is anywhere near worthy of a 10 either, so if you want a good time, give this film a try, but if you are looking for an Oscar worthy movie, stay away from Eragon.","

"kirilancelo","19 December 2006","For those who hasn't read the book, this movie might seems ""okay"". A good animation of the dragon, and the dragon rider fight's scene seems believable.However, the fast forward plot would certainty left you to feel like riding a frog, hop from one spot to the next one. And there's an odd feeling when you found that all races (beside the dragon) are totally alike. There's absolutely nothing specific to distinguish these races. Also, what's with the sets (Gilead city, Galbatorix's palace, and Shade's dungeon) ? They all looks like been built on a poor budget. I mean, does this eragon world really is a poor world. There's no sign of any glamors or great buildings at all. For example : Gil'ead was supposed to be a great shore city with buildings designed for battle, complete with a great wall. In this movie I see nothing but a poor fishermen's village (""village"" , not a city !!!!). Not to mention the grinned face you would be doing, every time eragon doing a face touching's scene with his dragon. Those scenes was not believable, cos the animation seems to not mixed well enough with the live characters.Far worse feeling must be felt by those who read the book. The book has been butchered, neutered, and brutally wrecked. None of the movie's plots has the same storyline with the book. Tragically, none of these movie's plots have a similar strength (with the book's plots) in building the story. Everything was messed up and downgraded. I really try to be positive about the movie. But after an hour and about 45 minutes of being annoyed and muttering lots of magic curse, I really can't be positive anymore.(1 hour and 45 minutes !!!! imagine that !!!! HOW MANY COLOSSAL MOVIES that you know, have such a short time duration ?!!!!!). In short story, I as one of the book reader firmly stated a refusal in referring this movie to the book. This movie is complete disaster for the book's translation. I strongly suggest a remake with new script writer, director, and animation studio.","

"celestihel","24 March 2007","5% names from the book. 5% approximate time line. 90% nothing remotely like the book. You'd think that in nearly 800 pages of novel, most of which was dialog, this script could have found...I don't know...ANY OF IT TO USE. Characters appear that have not yet shown up in 2 books in the series. Key plot points aren't even glossed over, they are omitted altogether. In their place are story lines that never existed. Frankly, they never should have. They didn't even give their elves pointy ears. I wouldn't complain, except that this is actually important in the book, both books. In short, this fabrication is a joke.I borrowed this movie from the library, for free. I want my money back.","

"bloodlust67","15 December 2006","So... there's cute little Saphira flying through the clouds, then ZAP!!! She's full grown!!! As soon as that happened I knew the movie was ruined. Here is a list of even more things wrong with this pathetic Hollywood adaptation of a great novel (i.e. every Stephen King novel made into a movie with the exception of The Stand): 1. Saphira instantly grows up while flying around.2. Roran was only in the movie for about 5 minutes. He left home as a draft dodger, not to work at the blacksmith (or whatever) to make money to marry Katrina.3. Murtaugh was only in the movie about 5 minutes. He seemed excited about going to meet the Varden, when actually he dreaded it in the book.4. Arya was portrayed as human (no pointy ears, or almond shaped eyes, or angled eyebrows). Arya was dark haired in the book, but blond in the movie. With all the money they spent making this movie, they couldn't afford a box of Clairol for her to dye her hair??? She also seemed to flirt and fawn on Eragon, where in the books she avoided him and was very strict about NOT getting involved. she did, afterall, destroy the magical drawing he made for her. Also she appeared to take great pleasure in the fact that she is an Elven Princess, when in the book she kept it a secret until the Queen exposed her in front of her friends.5. Where was Hrothgar? or Orlik? or the rest of the dwarfs??? they weren't even MENTIONED in the movie!!! if not for the dwarfs, Eragon and Saphira and even Arya would not have made it out of Trondjheim alive!!! they were entirely too important to the storyline to be so casually omitted from the movie.6. What happened to Eragon and Saphira going to Ellesmera for their training??? how is it Eragon learned 3 or 4 words from Brom then suddenly can start slinging magic like a cafeteria lady slings lumpy mashed potatoes?!!?! And when he fought Durza, he never got the debilitating wound on his back. Also, Eragon got his sword Zar'roc from Brom in the movie, where in the book he took it from Durza after he killed him.There is way too much more to list that is wrong with this movie. Didn't Christopher Paolini read the screenplay BEFORE he signed the contract for this movie deal??? In my opinion, he is a sellout and let the prospect of making more money from his story get in the way of preserving it. I will NOT waste another penny of my money on another movie adaptation or book of his. I will find somebody that has a free used copy of the last book of the Trilogy and read it then.","

"CuriosityKilledShawn","17 December 2006","I got all of the Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Dungeons and Dragons movies and rudely mashed them together after individually raping them in every orifice then you would get something that resembles Eragon (even the title is a rip-off of Aragorn from LOTR), a film so hopelessly incompetent that even something as basic as lip-syncing is off in almost every scene.Edward Speelers plays the personality-free title character. A young farm boy who is actually the only hope for a bunch of rebels...taken over the land of Alagesia...the chosen one...evil king...sorcerers, elves, orks, dwarfs...blah blah blah. God, I'm boring myself to tears. Speelers has about as much charisma as a lump of dung. And his forced, well-spoken English really got on my nerves.As much as some of the CGI was nice to look at, it just lacks the fantastical element that films such as Dragonslayer delivered so strongly. And the look and feel of the environments was utterly without any sense of atmosphere.And on top of that, there wasn't really anything happening in the film. A brief, unexciting battle scene at the end is the only action you will see in this movie. The rest of the 105 minute running time is just people riding horses. You think I am kidding? John Malkovich (who, by the looks of things, did a single days work) is wasted as the moronically named Galbatroxix or is it Galbathrax or Ozorganax or...something. The evil King! The King who is evil because he...just is. He sits in a dark chamber all day. Christ, how more evil than that can you possibly get. Jeremy Irons is the only good thing in it but he really is slumming it here. As is Rachel Weisz and Robert Carlisle as some sort of trans-sexual zombie wizard. None of them look like they are happy.It's a complete waste of time. Don't be fooled by the colorful posters and TV spots. It's a really terrible film indeed!","

"Smells_Like_Cheese","15 December 2006","My mom and I saw the theatrical trailer for Eragon and we were so excited because we love dragon movies and it looked so cool. Not to mention that we love John Malkovich and Jeremy Irons, so this was a film not to miss. We saw it tonite, opening night, and we were a bit confused by the theater's audience, most were children, we thought it would be kind of a Lord of the Rings movie, guess we were wrong. And three things I need to get out before I tell the story: My gay meter went off when I saw the lead actor, the super duper evil dude needed to brush his teeth, and I now want a baby dragon.Basically Eragon is a boy, well, 17 years old, but he is chosen to be a dragon rider when he finds a dragon egg. When he finds out that he has a fate to lead the dragon into battle and win the war against the evil king played by, big surprise, John Malkovich, and he also has to save a princess who is weak one moment and strong the next. But there is one flaw to having this dragon, if the dragon dies, the dragon dies, but if the rider dies, so does the dragon, so they have to keep each other alive.Well, it has it's hits and misses, I would recommend it for the theater because there were some very cool an impressive effects. But I think maybe I was expecting too much because I wasn't too pleased with how short and dismissive the story was and some of the actors seriously needed to drop the cheesy British accents. But Jeremy and the dragon make this movie worth your while, so judge for yourself.6/10","

"the-gossip-king","26 October 2007","This movie is nothing more than a disappointment. Unfortunately it has to be put flatly. The only good actors in the entire movie were Jeremy Irons who was very well cast as Brom and John Malcovich as Galbatorix (if the movie was faithful in the slightest to the book he shouldn't have even had a part.) However, that is no excuse because they are both just two fine actors. The actress of the female heroine Arya was rubbish. She gave the character in the movie a completely different personality to the one in the book. Edward Speelers I couldn't say was terrible because it is his first movie but he had no presence in the film. The visuals were good but that DOES NOT MAKE A MOVIE. The only other good thing was the voice of Saphira the dragon. Otherwise definitely not worth seeing unless it is free! Not worth anyone's money.","

"twofold420","6 September 2007","It was just like watching Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope all over again, except this time, we have a dragon. The plot is basically the same, stupid farm boy finds out he has special powers in world torn apart by an evil emperor. even the other characters are the same. we have the obi-wan, Leia, Han, Vader, etc. and this was actually based on a book. I hope George Lucas sued the author. what's the next one gonna be called if they make a sequel, ""Eragon Episode 5: John Malkovich Strikes Back""??? Anyway on to the actual movie ""qualities."" This has a lot of great actors to include John Malkovich, Jeremy Irons and Djimon Hounsou. Somehow they all managed to put in career worst performances. The only good acting was from Rachel Weisz, probably because she didn't appear in the movie, just her voice for the dragon. On to music now! The soundtrack was actually good, because if you play it while watching ""Star Wars,"" it will eerily fit like Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon' with ""The Wizard of Oz."" Amazing!! Now the effects were good when it concerned the dragons, otherwise they were unimpressive. That is why I gave this movie 3 stars instead of 1. There are a lot of other connections to ""Star Wars"" of course, so even if I write them down, I still won't have to put a spoiler warning, because I wouldn't be giving anything away, unless you never seen ""Star Wars"" of course.","

"bornintwilight","23 April 2007","How is it even possible to make such a horribly bad movie from such a good book? Christopher Paolini must be mortified, or at least he should be! I can't answer for what these people envisioned for Eragon but I pray that this wasn't it! The characters are awful and so is the script. It's torture to watch Jeremy Irons struggle to at least improve the situation but even though he is talented and always does his best there's only so much he can do. The whole story is flat and uninteresting and I found that I really couldn't care less what happened to anyone, least of all Eragon. Further more the butchering of the book eliminated several important characters and events that only adds to the misery that is Eragon the movie. It is never easy to change a book into a movie but by God they have to be able to do a better job than this.My only hope is that they stop at one movie and leave the rest of the books alone!","

"Nyx_Selene","17 March 2011","Note: Spoilers ahead.""Eragon"" is about the young idiot Eragon, who lives in Hobbiton.Okay, maybe not, but his home looks a bit too much like it for it to be coincidental. In fact, the entire movie looks like the sets came from a LotR yard sale. Some of the opening scenes as well, sadly. I've never heard an evil king open with a line like ""I suffer without my stone"", though, so that's new. He does so because it was stolen from him, by people who've ""been carrying it for as long as we can remember"". I don't get it.Anyway, Eragon is a 17-year-old farm boy who finds this blue stone/egg, and it hatches into a blue, telepathic dragon that grows up in about 2 days. Because of this, the evil king wants him dead, 'cause the king went through a lot a trouble killing off all dragons except his own, so he's not really happy that there's a new one. By this point, Eragon's uncle gets killed by something resembling chirping shrubs, and his cousin has run off to avoid being drafted, so the poor guy is left with the dragon as his only friend and family.However, a local bum turns out to be a former dragon rider, so he takes Eragon under his protection, and they go on a quest to find the freedom fighters ""the Varden"", to mobilize against the evil king. Now that a naive brat has a dragon, victory against the king's army is more or less guaranteed, you see. During the trip the older, wiser rider tries to teach the younger, dumber one some valuable lessons, but since Eragon is an idiot, he gets his teacher killed. How? Well, he dreams about this 13 years older stranger-girl who's being held prisoner at an enemy stronghold. Of course, he needs to go save her. Don't know why, and I don't know why he thinks he's the perfect person to do it. He nearly gets them all killed.They eventually find the Varden, who turns out to be Africans, Scots and who knows what, since they're dressed in gold chain-mail and silk burkas and live in Minas Tirith – sorry, the mountains. These people make absolutely no sense to me. What are they supposed to be? They're hiding among mountains after having fled from the king's army, and unless their leader is immortal, they can't have been there more than 10-15 years. Still, the upper sections of the ""hideout"" are delicately cut directly out of the rocks, but the lower ones consist of mud, and wooden poles tied together with rope. People are dressed in the most colorful and intricately patterned get-ups possible – preferably in expensive materials too. Except for the Scots, who're paranoid enough to wear armor 24-7, it seems. Who the hell are these people? Why do they think their clothes are more important than their defenses? They run into battle in long green-pink-yellow skirts and so much bling they make more noise than the invading army. Is all this explained in the book? I haven't read it.Moving on, they're all attacked by some tattooed guys, and the king's army. Why I can't fathom. There's at least 24 hours between the enemy forces finding the Varden, and the actual attack. Why doesn't the king just fly in with his dragon and torch the lot as soon as he finds out the location? Then there'd be him, his dragon, his army and his sorcerer against a 17-year-old and a newly hatched dragon. I'd prefer those odds, if I were him.But no, he leaves the dragon safely at home, and sends the army instead. An army that apparently consists largely or partly by the forced and unwilling, since the king drafts people from every village. They're lead by the sorcerer, Durza – who is, by the way, the only interesting thing in this entire movie. An army of oppressed, drafted people, set up to fight against freedom fighters I wouldn't trust that to go well, but maybe Durza has some Jedi mind trick to keep them from deserting.Moving on again, Eragon's dragon picks this exact moment to grow up enough to breath fire, and they save the day. They also kill the sorcerer, sadly, making sure that we'll have that much less to keep us awake in a possible sequel. Not that I expect that anybody will be making one anytime soon.The movie mostly just feels stupid. The acting is really bad in most places, to the extent that I've seen better among 14-year-olds in live role-playing games. The all around plagiarizing of Lord of the Rings doesn't help, even if the almost-Balrog in the end looks nice. And I have nothing against Rachel Weisz or her voice, but why does Eragon's dragon sound like his mother? Especially when you just KNOW that the king's huge, black, bad-ass dragon is going to sound like Darth Vader? So yes, maybe it's cool if you're a very young kid. I'm guessing they're the targeted audience anyway.","

"FreakierThanThou","22 December 2006","There were some moments of Eragon that I had problems with. The timing, for one. It went much to fast, a few hours giving months worth of travel, growth, or training for the characters. But overall, I found the movie worthwhile, if you can ignore that.The book was different, and, in a way, I might have had an advantage over some others, not remembering it very clearly. But honestly, have you ever seen a movie based off of a book that was completely true? You have to be able to ignore the changes. There will be people who will hate it if it's not identical to the book. If you're one of those people, I would advise you not to waste your time seeing it, because it's not.Yes, as others have pointed out, it has similarities to other books and movies, but so what? Lots of movies and books follow formulas of previous successes.Eragon is a movie you shouldn't try and compare to predecessors. If you can do that, it will be very good. Great choreography, good acting, most of it well-written... if plot holes and outside influences can be forgotten, it's a very entertaining movie.","

"runnerever","16 December 2006","I loved the book, but I made sure that when I went into the theater that I stayed objective, knowing that movies after books are rarely (not a one can I think of) true to form. SO..... with great anticipation I looked forward to the interpretation of the director/writers. IT WAS CRAP! My first thought was of my son's homework he did the other night when I told him he had to do it all before going to his wrestling match. Everything was chicken scratch (bcuz he had to write so fast), all of his answers were less than 5 words long and had no complete sentences, and there were many problems in which he he left answers blank, answered a question other than the one asked, or just put a bogus answer that did the reader no service upon reading it. That is how I feel about this movie. Still, I am trying to stay objective and not rate it based upon the storyline in the book. I ASSURE YOU, I AM NOT. But this movie sucks. All of the lines were cheesy, choppy and childish. The plot was never explained, there was no sense of climax, the music didn't match the theme/tone, most scenes were either too long or too short, and WORST OF ALL: All of the Eragon lovers (since I saw it on opening night) were yelling ""booo"" at trash talking it on the way out of the theater. It was a VERY SAD OCCASION for someone who entered the theater desperate for a satisfying experience. Don't waste your money. It will be selling soon online for a buck and then if you want, you may get it for your kids who if they have the maturity level of less than 11, they will probably like it. I'm sorry to have to report this tragedy to you.

"Kryzak","18 December 2006","""I suffer without my stone. Do not prolong my suffering."" - John Malkovich as King Galvatron-Matrix... eh, I meant Galbatorix.Wow... how did they make a movie THIS bad??? Before I go into the bad things, let's talk about what's good:Jeremy Irons did his best to work with absolutely NOTHING... I applaud his effort.The CG and scenery were good, but nothing to write home about compared to Lord of the RingsUm... that's it...The bad:The acting was very wooden and unnatural... not horrible, but not good either.The story was a merging of Star Wars with Lord of the Rings, with a bit of Dungeons and Dragons thrown in. I don't know what the book is like, but the author/writer clearly was influenced by the two stories and merged them together... An example you ask?Eragon = Luke Princess Arya = Princes Leia King Galbatorix/Durza = Emperor/Darth Vader Magic = Force Varden Stronghold = Helm's DeepThere was even a sunset scene with Eragon sitting on cliff looking out into the horizon! I was only surprised that there weren't two suns in the sky!The dialogue... OH MY, the dialogue was horrible! As you can see in the FIRST line of the movie, it did not get to a good start. Every line delivered was painful to hear, and sometimes you just cannot believe that the characters are uttering such gibberish. I took a quick look at the book at Borders after the movie, and it was definitely better written than the dialogue in the movie. All in all, it was a movie where I laughed out loud with my friends multiple times (and not for good reason) and kept on throwing out LOTR and Star Wars references throughout the movie. I went in with very low expectations, but I didn't expect an ""epic"" (only 90 minutes long) movie like this would be THAT bad... The only thing I can say about it is, it's better than Dungeons and Dragons... and that's not saying much!Watch this movie at your own risk and peril!","

"LarGallo","20 December 2006","My whole family absolutely loved the book.....all of us. We HATED this movie. Instead of saying ""based on the book by Chris Paolini"", it should have said ""Sort-of based on some ideas of what a screen-writer who didn't read the book might have dreamed up"". The characters are thin, the action is forced and the sets are a major disappointment (especially Tronjheim). I expected some shortening of things and reasonable omissions, especially with a run time of only 1 hour and 39 minutes. I did NOT expect a complete rewrite of the story. Essential characters are left out, plot lines are omitted completely changed, and event sequences are rearranged in a completely random manner. Please do NOT waste your money on this film even if you haven't read the book. The movie will NOT make you want to read it and that is a shame as the book is a great read no matter where he got some of the ideas from. I wouldn't even waste 2 dollars on this as a rental....as a matter of fact, I won't ever watch it on TV either!! BAD MOVIE!!","

"Dan-121","15 December 2006","First of all, let me say that I have neither read the book nor have I even heard of it until this movie.The plot of this film is pretty derivative. Pacing seems to be a problem. Events seem to conveniently occur to progress the story such as the little dragon turning instantly into a full grown one after taking flight. Maybe that happens in the book but in the film, that feels contrived. There is also very little character development apart from Eragon. All these left me somewhat uninvolved and indifferent to the story. The short running time also works against the movie particularly since this movie is supposed to be the first part of a fantasy series.From a technical viewpoint, the film is outstanding. The computer-generated images are excellent particularly those of the dragon, Saphira. The cinematography is breathtaking and beautiful.The cast is pretty decent. The supporting actors do what they can with the underdeveloped screenplay. Some scenes felt somewhat hammy to me particularly those involving John Malkovich. Suffice to say, many of the notable actors in this movie are underused, particularly John Malkovich. His King Galbatorix character is so one-dimensional, I was thinking people are going to say the acting is terrible. However, it is really the fault of the screenplay. Thankfully, newcomer Edward Speleers is able to carry the film well.The action scenes are well staged. In particular, I found the final battle between Eragon and Durza thrilling. There are also some funny and emotionally resonant scenes particularly those between Eragon and Saphira but these are few and far between.Overall, Eragon is a technically accomplished film but is let-down by an underdeveloped screenplay. I give it an 8/10 because I love fantasy action adventure movies.","

"dale_jr_fan","18 December 2006","What happened to this movie? I loved the book, but this movie stinks. It is not true to the book, leaves too much out, and the rest is unimaginative. The bad guys--Urgals and Razac--are about as believable as kids playing Cowboys and Indians. I had my doubts about Ed Speleers being cast as Eragon from the beginning. He just did not click with me, turns out I was right. The trip Eragon, Sapphira, Brom and Arya made to the Varden and the Dwarf city seemed to take about two or three days, as opposed to weeks in the book. Sapphira's near instantaneous maturation is a crock of s*it, Uncle Garrow's house was destroyed by the Razac in the book, not by Brom. Angela was much older in the book. Zaroc, if I remember correctly, had a red jewel in the hilt,(not blue) to match the color of the rider's dragon which Zaroc belonged to (Morzan). No werecat in the movie. In the movie, Murtagh shows up out of nowhere during Arya's rescue--this is not in the book. Where were the twins?? The twins are key characters to the turn of events in the Eldest. My gosh, I could go on half the night about what is wrong with this movie, but I make my point. Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich seemed to have tried their best to sustain this movie, but with the screen play being the utterly horrid and unimaginative adaptation of the book that it is, they just couldn't get the job done. THE ONLY things about this movie that I even remotely enjoyed were Rachel Weisz's voice over of Sapphira, the CGI for Sapphira, and the scenery. The scenery was stunning. I am really, really, really disappointed with this movie for two reasons. I enjoyed the book so much I looked forward to adding the movie to my DVD collection, but it ain't gonna happen. This movie will likely be such a dud that there will be no Eldest sequel. That there will likely be no sequel is hard to think about, because Eldest in many ways is better than Eragon because of clearer character development and plot twists that will surprise you right up 'till the end of the book. I guess the best that fans of Eragon can hope for is that that it will be remade into its blockbuster potential. I guess all the haters of the book out there finally have something to gloat about, unfortunately.","

"iMacWaveMaster","15 December 2006","My initial reaction throughout most of the movie was, ""What the hell!"" Eragon, the book, is a wonderful story of a farm boy who comes across a blue stone (which resembles a huge marbled egg, not a pill). And in immersed in an adventure of epic proportions as that blue stone turns out to have hatched a dragon. He becomes the world's last hope as he becomes the new dragon rider. A dragon rider has the ability to have conversations with his dragon (through their minds) and use magic. Magic is basically as strong as the will you have in your body. Many cities are visited and many creatures are seen like the Urgals (spiraled horned creatures) Razaacs (cloaked beaked creatures) dwarfs and elves. Now Eragon, the movie, is a horrible piece of garbage. Eragon, played by Edward Speleers, looks like he has never did any farm work a day in his life. Arya, the elf played by Sienna Guillory, was supposed to be unconscious throughout most of the first book. But yet she has a big part in the movie. Murtagh, Garrett Hedlund, actually trains in combat with Eragon in the story. In the movie they barely converse with one another. Roran, Christopher Egan, goes off to work in order to be able to support a live with the woman he loves, Katrina. In the movie, she's not even introduced, or mentioned, and Roran gives the excuse that he's leaving to serve in the army. During the scene when Eragon flies in the air for the first time, it is supposed to be snowing and he gets badly cut on his thighs by Saphira's scales. Sadly the whole movie took over in a span of three days, when the book takes a course of about a year. The Urgals, which are supposed to be horned demon like creatures are, in the movie, men with face paint. The Razaacs, which are cloaked beak like creatures, were a cross between Predator and the Mummy. King Hrothgar is the king of the dwarfs, in the movie his name is not even mentioned and he looks just like another person. The Urgals, Dwarfs, and Elves look just like regular people. And my girlfriend caught this goof, Arya is an elf, but she is wearing leather boots. Elves, as we learn in the second book, respect all living life and do not eat meat. Why in the world is she wearing leather? So much was spliced together and it was worse than I thought it would be, because I am a huge fan of the book. I read it just a year ago and read the sequel last summer. There were so many unnecessary changes some of them quite major and also changes that affected the sequel to Eragon making it useless. I hope to everything that is good and pure that this movie gets pulled from theaters and they banned Stefen Fangmeier from directing a possible sequel. I'm just glad that I read this wonderful book first, cause if I had to just base my Eragon experience on that garbage, then I would not have bothered trying to read the book.","

"donteathemonkey","15 December 2006","I am going to put this plainly and straight out with the facts and finish up with me I left with two impressions of this film. It was made to make money, not in the desire to make this great book come to life. And two, it reminded me of the old Hercules T.V. show its special affects, dialogue, action scenes, and character development, Horrid.People actually booed in my theatre at the midnight showing with a full house. There was even a boy crying to his mom telling her that they ruined it afterwards with her comforting him. No joke! For those that read the book this is what they kept, with me inserting much of what they added.The names: Saphira, Brom, Arya. Durza. King Galbatorix, Murtagh, Roran, Angela who makes a brief appearance.The Story: 10 min: Eragon picking up the egg, egg hatches (then uh oh this right?) Saphira flies for the first time as a youngling and within some lighting full matures and comes out of the clouds as an adult exclaiming! ""I have been waiting for you a thousand years, I am Saphira you are Eragon! No development, just Eragon is the boy and Saphira is the wise old Dragon that Eragon has supreme control over.Insert>Dramatic Music 6 min: Brom, Eragon, and Saphira start journey to Varden.Insert>Dramatic Music 8 min: Being chased by ninja's that have maggots around their face. Meet Urgals: Who are actually big bald guys with tattoos.Insert>Dramatic Music 10 min: Must stop to rescue Arya. Almost dies barely makes it and meets Murtagh. (Oh yea Brom dies by jumping in front of a spear from Durza. Saphira blows fire and Brom encased in glass. (Btw Arya is fine right now and healthy as can be watching all of this).Insert>Dramatic Music 5 min: They get back to campthen Arya falls ill. Now they must hurry to the Vardin and Murtagh tells Eragon that he must trust him. Hurry to the Varden.Insert>Dramatic Music 8 min: First Dialogue We must hurry Urgals are closing in(huh? Where did that come from) Insert>Dramatic Music 10 min:You with the Varden? Yes, lock Murtagh up. Here is your armor.Insert>Dramatic Music and battle 10 min: Durza summons a dragon thing to fight Saphira and Eragon, (btw no mountain with the jewel at the top, it's in a valley) and no indication really that there are any dwarfs.15 min: Saphira almost dies, Eragon heals, they both wake up are heroes Insert>Dramatic Music Ya! The end.Horrible I will never buy it, nor will I ever see it again. I right this honestly and truthfully as you watch it (gasp I hope not) you will notice many other key things they forgot: Character Development, Eragons relationship with Saphira and him raising her, Arya sickness, Urgals as fat bald men, ARGH basically everything.Insert>Dramatic Music Written by a truly sad fan. How could you let them do this to your story Christopher?","

"DICK STEEL","13 December 2006","I'm not sure why many have cited this to be yet another epic fantasy movie in the mould of Lord of the Rings, or even Harry Potter. Perhaps it's the release date, given that all make it to the silver screen toward the end of the year. However, given that the story is based on a novel written by a sixteen year old at the time, the shades of familiarity stem from something on a grander scale. And to me, it's Star Wars: A New Hope.The similarities are obvious. Eragon (Edward Speleers), the farmboy, raised not by his parents, but by his relatives. He learns how to use mystical power bestowed upon him, and has a mentor, Brom (Jeremy Irons), teach him the ways too. The villains wield same capabilities, and they all wear black, seeking to destroy hope. Midway, there's a quest to save Princess Arya (Sienna Guillory), and it all culminates in a huge battle, except that the villains launch the initiative, like the Battle of Hoth rather than Yavin.If that doesn't sound like A New Hope to you, then you'd probably come to enjoy Eragon, the first part of the Inheritance trilogy. However, if you make the connection, then I'd say you'll be pretty much bored as the movie has neither many moments to whip up your adrenaline, and is filled with a number of dialogue that will make you cringe. Perhaps the finale battle is the only saving grace of this movie, but even that has shades of LOTR's attack at Helm's Deep, only that it's on a much smaller scale, and lacking in detail.The cast is quite spectacular, though I'm a bit surprised that Jeremy Irons is in the movie. Some of you would have known he starred in the grand daddy of fantasy realms - Dungeons and Dragons, but unfortunately, that movie bombed. I suppose he's back here to make amends, but unfortunately, he doesn't get much opportunity to do so. Robert Carlyle as chief villain in this installment is your typical over the top overconfident bad guy, and he's the one with the inappropriate funny lines, which seem to repeat themselves over and over again. John Malkovich is a complete waste as the evil King, and as villains, repeat themselves ad nauseam. Perhaps as a hint, the filmmakers have reigned him in to unleash more mayhem in the sequels.Saphira the dragon is designed beautifully enough though, given the last celebrity voiced dragon we saw was in Dragonheart, provided by Sean Connery. But I suspect that the baby dragon will win a lot more hearts than a fully grown one. You can hear those gasps amongst the audience, that should some marketing folk start making the plush toy, it'll sell like hotcakes this Christmas.Eragon clocks in at way under 2 hours, which is hardly material enough to consider it an epic. Given the shortened run time, there are various bits on the character's learning and development of abilities which seemed very rushed and summarized even, making it feel very choppy. However, as with all first films of the trilogy, it's the establishment of who's who and what's what, so hopefully, if a sequel pulls through, that it'll be way better than this one.And yeah, it cracked me up upon hearing Saphira (voiced by Rachel Weisz) stating that she needed a rider. Ha!","

"the_moody_youngest","11 December 2006","Saphira was a great dragon. Always did what she was told. This movie was good, but still disappointing. I liked the book but this wasn't the best. Speeler's acting was mediocre and it didn't exactly follow the book, but oh shoot, it was certainly entertaining. The special effects were not stunning like the BRILLIANT ones in X Men: The Last Stand but they were acceptable. Saphira looked pretty cool and Brom was such a good character. My favorite still is and always has been Murtagh because he was excellent. Mr. Hedlund did amazing and was the best actor, next to Jeremy. Siena was acceptable although she was a terrible fighter, but I think that was just Arya.This film was certainly enjoyable in every way and you will more than likely love it. I didn't but I certainly liked watching it. Check this film out, it is certainly a winner.7/10","

"KrIaXPaTaLa","14 December 2006","Just saw the premiere, here in Portugal, and after reading all the terrible reviews, I was ready for the worse case scenario. Fortunatly, it wasn't THAT bad, I actually enjoyed the movie, but one cannot stop wondering why the hell they trashed a lot more of the original tale then necessary. The CGI is great, the cast is actually quite decent, and it really looks like the team that brought us this, wanted the movie do be bad. The ""catch phrases"" are as awful and basic as any B-movie, and the interaction between characters should have been worked a lot better. But it's fair to say that who hasn't read the book, will overlook some of the flaws.I'm giving it a 6. A 7 may also be adequate, but... I've read the book.","

"goldenduc","11 December 2006","I saw this with a friend of mine over the weekend in a press screening and I really did not enjoy it. The special effects are fine but the story is rather hammy and the performances are not very good. The main character looks like a deer in head lights most of the time and the villains acts like cartoon stereotypes more than real characters. Most of the characters here seem like rejects from other films and it shows by how unoriginal they were. The only performance in the film that has any credibility what so ever is the dragon Saphira and that's mainly because she is voiced by Oscar winning actress Rachel Weisz, who has more talent in her vocal cords than all the actors working in this film combined.My suggestion, wait for DVD.","

"charliecheswick","10 April 2007","I've never read the book , so I watched this movie with open eyes. And after watching this abomination , I don't think I will make the effort to read the book. The moment Eragons character walked on set I instantly disliked him.(He looked more like someone from a G.A.P advert rather than a farm hand). A good looking ,gormless , perfectly spoken , publicly schooled , county cricket club member, fox hunting type.It just as easily could have been a younger James Hewitt or Harry Enfields ""Tim Nice but Dim"" creation. But , I thought , maybe he will make a fantastic right of passage journey in this film and come out as likable and who has been transformed into an underdog hero. No luck , by the end of this movie I wished that Jeremy Irons had beaten him to a bloody pulp in their earlier training session.This is by far not the worse thing about this movie however , the major flaw is that overall it is really badly put together. It just seems like it is fragments of a greater story , like scenes were cut out of the final edit , maybe they were?? , For instance , Irons says to the young James Hewitt , something along the lines of ""Magic will take a long time to learn as you need to learn the ancient elvish language , blah de blah etc... "" 2 minutes later , Eragon has mastered it , no explanation , nothing , what the hell? Did they omit this scene were he learnt it , or was it just deemed not important. Well it was important , as its little details like this that have viewers thinking , ""what the hell is going on ?"" Characters are also introduced here and there , I barely caught their names or their significance to the overall story. His brother , an uncle, a cousin , some guy who has been following him,the guy from trainspotting, a women on a table, a king. We don't get any insight into there characters , they are just there to fill the screen . To wrap up this farce , John Malchovich gives a performance which has undertones of "" I cant be bothered with this crap man , but I need the paycheck "".","

"AloysiusWeasley","30 December 2007","*******EXTREMELY MILD SPOILERS!********* For starters, I'm a big fan of sci-fi and fantasy, and I usually go out of my way to see movies like this. I let Eragon slip by while it was in theaters, because I found the book to be absolutely dreadful, reading like exactly who had written it: a Lords of the Rings/Star Wars fanboy nerd who sat around in his parents' basement before crapping this out. I still wanted to see the movie, because the special effects looked pretty cool, and it would less of a waste than forcing myself to read the whole book.I never considered the movie could be even WORSE! Seriously, I'm trying to think of what was actually GOOD about this movie, and...well...the baby dragon was kinda cute. And some of the scenery was pretty nice. And...that's all I got.Probably the most horrible thing about this movie was the complete and utter lack of any sort of characterization whatsoever. By the end of the movie, you will hardly be able to remember the names of the characters, much less care about what happens to them.A close second to that is how horribly clichéd this is. I mean, if you've read or even seen LotR, you know what happens. As a matter of fact, if you've seen either one of these, you could make the viewing more enjoyable by MST'ing it and pointing out all the rip-offs. Most especially the hunting horn (BOROMIR!), the battle (HELM's DEEP!), the enemy forces (ORCS!), and a whole bunch of others I'm too apathetic about this movie to list.As for the rest of the flaws? The f/x have their good parts and their bad parts. I actually saw on the Wiki page that a couple sources applauded how great the dragon looked. No, no, it didn't, it looked like GCI trash. From what the fans say, the movie hacked out even larger chunks of book to make the movie than the Harry Potter ones do, and that's REALLY saying something.Honestly, I'm just glad I never bought this movie, and got to view it with friends instead. I haven't heard anything about a (movie) sequel, which surprises me not in the slightest. Basically, if you're looking for a movie to play/practice Mystery Science Theatre on, this one's pretty good. Otherwise, please, don't waste your time!","

"papadoudjh","15 December 2006","This quote gives a good review of the movie as a whole. I came into the theater with no prior knowledge of the books, and left with hardly anymore than when I entered. If not for the coffee I drank before the showing I would likely have been awakened an hour later by children applauding the movie they had been fooled into viewing. As Goldenduc has stated, the movie's scene-stealer was Saphira, the dragon whose above average animation and voice-acting carried the movie. Readers of the book(such as two of my fellow viewers who reported it horribly inaccurate) will be disappointed by the film's bad acting and poorly-paced chronology(Or may lie to themselves and give it a 10 like 41% of the voters thus far).Those who enjoyed the masterpiece book ""Eragon"" were most likely suspicious when the movie's rating was revealed as PG. As 6 to 12-year-olds filled the theater, older members of the audience felt an ominous chill that manifests before the start of a poor movie. From the moment the main character picks up his bow in the opening scene, you can sense the films bad filmography and quick pace will be it's downfall. Roughly ten minutes into the movie the main character's are introduced and killed-off or sent away. Soon after Saphira hatches and creates a false sense of hope that the movie may be saved. Before the audience was done ""Aww""-ing at the cute dragonling, it transforms into a full-grown beast and its bond with it's rider is solidified. A few more poor actors are introduced and the ""Darkest Knight""-esquire fumbles onward, sprinting through the most important parts and trudging through meaningless scenes. Before you know it the final (and first?) battle has been fought and won, and a miserable cliffhanger paves the way for a sequel movie-goers are sure to avoid.The one upside to the movie was not it's namesake, but the dragon on which Eragon rides, Saphira. The dragon's animation is fluid and realistic(although not when Eragon is integrated) and its voice calming yet authoritative. However, like most of the movie, the dragons physical maturation and bond with it's rider goes by too fast and leaves the viewer with an unpleasant longing for more. The fact the intelligent dragon needs a rider in the first place may have fantasy-buffs in wonder.To wrap-up it should be stated that the movie is rated PG for a reason, because there's just enough violence that it didn't make G. The constant new information is introduced to fast and is reminiscent of children role-playing(""It's(the sword) a dragon killer!"" ""You must pierce a Shade in the heart to kill it."" ""If a dragon's rider dies, so does the dragon""). The erratic pace of the movie makes no sense, more time is spent showing Saphira learn to fly than is Eragon's time of mourning for his lost uncle. Overall, the movie earned 4 stars( of 10) for it's decent CGI and voice-acting, and the remaining 6 were stripped away due to lame pacing, bad acting and pseudo-logical fallacies that made you think ""Wait, what?""","

"happyface4501","20 December 2006","My friend and I went to go see this movie and it was so bad it was funny. The effects are good and the baby dragon was cute but beside that, everything stunk! The outline of this movie was really bad. Good for a book but bad for a movie. I really hope the makers of this movie do not make a squeal. I was kind of looking forward to this movie because the book was pretty good but the movie just killed it. It was like a Harry Potter movie but worse. I don't really recommend this movie but if you're really into movies that have to do with fantasy then you might like it. But the effects were good I have to admit that. It was bad and the actors were scary. Sorry.","

"tony-howe","13 December 2006","I went to the premier of this in London. The trailers promised much, but the reality was rather disappointing.The main problem is the original source material. We should congratulate a 15 year old for writing any kind of book really, but it just doesn't hold up well on the screen. For such a basic good vs. evil premise, there are gaping holes in the plot. Where did the stone come from? Who exactly is the main female character? Why have the rebels not been wiped out before all this happens if they're so easy to find and the king is so powerful for example? The characters seem able to cover immense distances in double-quick time which kills any sense of grandeur for the setting, and they have a habit of making miraculous off-screen recoveries from seemingly fatal injuries - as if that kind of human struggle is of no interest to the viewer. The dialogue is clumsy and so is a lot of the delivery - a shame as there are some good actors obviously treading water here, (although Jeremy Irons is good as always), and most of the characters are two-dimensional at best. The main character undergoes an unconvincing transformation from insignificant farm lad to powerful magician in the space of about 10 minutes as well, which adds to the lack of scale the film has - it's as if we are simply chucked from one set piece to another.The special effects are pretty good however, and the final battle scene is undeniably exciting and well executed. Kids will love it I'm sure, but the parents who accompany them will probably be bored and have fond memories of how films like The Dark Crystal did this sort of thing very much better when they were younger.","

"bryandeth316","3 March 2007","I will keep this short and I will keep this sweet.I am a HUGE fan of the Inheritence series. I think it is a very well written, very imaginative story and I think that Christopher Paolini is definitely a wonderful author. Why however he would let his brain child be destroyed and quite frankly ruined like this is beyond me. I was so excited to see this movie, I was ready to burst I was so anxious. Then, within 2 minutes, I was more angry than I should be at a movie. I have NEVER walked out on a movie before, NEVER. Not even when I went to go see Blue Chips starring Shaquille O'Neal and Nick Nolte, but I walked out of this movie. I just couldn't take anymore of one of my favorite stories being done such a disservice.John Malcovich's performance was flat, Jeremy Irons was horrible, even Rachel Weisz who I am a pretty big fan of was terrible. The characters that were detailed so well in the book were given no respect what so ever. Angela the herbalist was done very horribly, and of course her were-cat friend Solembum wasn't even IN the movie as I could see since I walked out early, and Joed wasn't even mentioned. The movie's pace was awful, the script was awful, and of course the lead of the movie was cardboard at best. Horst the blacksmith was only referred to briefly and he seemed to only be the village drunk. Bad, bad, BAD adaptation. Paolini should have done like J.K. Rowling has done with the Harry Potter movies, how she has to approve everything first because Paolini's masterpiece was sullied.DO NOT go and see this movie if you are a fan of the series. And if you are interested in getting into the series...DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! Or better yet, go see this movie and then read the book so you can see how it's really suppose to be.","

I was stunned to find not one good comment in a gigantic trash pile of supposedly witty remarks and reasons on how the movie ""sucked"". I have not read the book myself (I know I'm going to get bombed for this in a reply later), but I thought the movie was totally awesome, and deserves to be acknowledged as a piece of cinematic art, despite the fact it is merely one and a half hours long or so, but who cares? I certainly don't, and look forward eagerly to the sequel.Maybe I shall read the book someday, just to see what you people are talking about.

"paulclaassen","9 August 2021","It's interesting to see most critics disliked 'Eragon', yet the film was a box office success, proving the general public enjoyed it.Ed Speleers stars as the film's titular character, Eragon, whom I thought did a good job as the protagonist. He had a likability that made me root for him. Eragon's life is thrown into turmoil when he finds a mysterious rock in the woods, which turns out to be a dragon egg. The set-up of the dragon and Eragon being able to communicate via mind reading was a bit much to swallow, but I suppose it was required for the movie to work the way they wanted it to. This aspect will appeal more to a young audience who watches cartoons, while a mature audience might find this amusing, to say the least, and raise an eyebrow or two.I enjoyed Jeremy Irons as Brom, who's character has an interesting reveal later. John Malkovich was born to portray villains. Unfortunately, here, he isn't given much to do with a seriously underdeveloped character, Galbatorix. This character has so much potential, yet all he did in the few moments he was on screen, was give orders. He was a passive character who might as well not have been there.The real antagonist is Shade. Shade is more of an entity or spirit than an actual character, but it was creepy at times. The film features beautiful cinematography and great visuals, with a very realistically designed dragon. With sorcerers, ogres, dragons, dragons riders, what's not to enjoy here - if you're into fantasy, off course. This is an enjoyable fantasy adventure, with a stunning final battle scene. It was also nice to only have a subtle hint at romance, instead of a love interest intervening in the action, as is the case with most (Hollywood) films of this genre.","

"superduperspit","20 December 2006","What most dooms Eragon is the fact that, as hard as it tries to be different, it is impossible for the viewer to not help but draw comparisons to ""Lord of the Rings,"" be it plot, visuals, acting, script, and setting. Being forced to compare this to such a great trilogy does not help this fantasy adventure film out, because in every aspect, it falls greatly under the high bar set by ""Rings."" The biggest problem that the film faces is Eragon himself, played by Edward Speelers, a guy in his late teens who has had no acting experience whatsoever. It really shows. Although neither Elijah Wood (who played Frodo) or Daniel Radcliff (who plays Harry Potter) were phenomenal actors or the core of their fantasy franchises, they at least managed to create emotional depth that allows us to really worry about them. For Frodo, Wood makes us really care about whether or not he will manage to fight off the power of the ring, and Radcliffe lets us see both the adventurous side of Harry, as well as the teenage side wanting to live a normal life. Speelers, on the other hand, cannot ever take Eragon much further than speaking normal lines. When he attempts to show great emotion, it is very difficult to really let yourself be thrown into his character.Although the visuals for the film are quite remarkable (they are the highlight of the film and worthy of an Oscar nomination), many of the other technicalities the film faces are not so successfully handled. Creating costumes for a fantasy world is very difficult to pull off without making them look ridiculous, but Peter Jackson appeared to have no trouble at all accomplishing this. While the simpler clothing (Eragon's peasant clothing) works out fine, much of what you see people wear is enough on its own to make you take your eye off what is happening in the film and stare at these bizarre wardrobes.You would think that when a film is getting a response this weak, I would probably be hoping that it would have been shorter. On the contrary, this one hour, fifty minute picture is greatly harmed by being far too short. What this prevents from happening is allowing any of the scenes to have any depth or true emotion. In ""Lord of the Rings,"" the Battle of Minas Tirith was probably about forty minutes in total. Here, the great climactic battle is no more than ten minutes in length, and because the film ends shortly afterwards, you are left with a great longing to have seen more than what you got. If it had been another thirty or forty minutes longer (and yes, I really mean that much), the pacing could have been much better and allowed the film to cover more than it did, making it a better overall film experience. Although there are many problems with Eragon, ""boring"" is one of the last words I would use to describe it.Summary: Although ""Eragon"" is an entertaining and fun adaptation, it lacks far too much in the areas that count to join the ranks of ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Star Wars"" as one of the great sagas of our time.Review by Billybob Washere, written for film site www.boxofficefanatic.com","

"mlg-t888","28 May 2009","Instantly infamous, completely inescapable, unrelentlessly unforgivable, let's give it up for Eragon folks! Oh yes, for those of you who are wondering ""Is it really all that bad?"". Let me stop you right there, THIS MOVIE IS THAT BAD. And the most disturbing thing about it is, it wasn't bad because it was unfaithful to the book! It was simply an absolutely terrible excuse for a film.The first of the many film-making atrocities so shamelessly committed by this movie, was making an adaption of the book in the first place. Christopher Paolini's uninspired rip-off of Star Wars, but at least relatively endearing novel never needed a film adaption, it didn't deserve one. A film adaption is bad enough in concept, but adding to this is the fact that it was simply a badly made movie.Every aspect of this movie felt cheap, from the CGI to the armies of what appeared to be around fifty people. Everything from weaponry to sets felt like a downgraded version of previously released fantasy films.The second most obvious flaw, was the terrible casting. It really was obvious from the get-go, I mean Joss Stone? Really? Are you kidding? Among the blatantly miscast was Ed Speleers, a typical, bland, blonde pretty boy who (surprise, surprise) had never been in a movie before! He was cast after being rejected from ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" (thank God). There's nothing worse than making an already bland character even more so.Jeremy Irons just can't seem to get cast in a good fantasy movie can he? He was cast as the old wise jedi... I mean Dragon Rider, Brom, who is consistently fighting the evil Empire led by former Jed... I mean Dragon Rider, Darth Va... I mean Galbatorix (played by John Malcovich). Malcovich's Galbatorix is as generic a bad guy as you can imagine. He's a couch potato who apparently lives in a cave and has his evil Michael Jackson look-alike, Durza (played by Robert Carlyle) carry out his dirty deeds.The rest of the cast is made up of the elf without pointy ears Arya (Sienna Guillory), the ever-bored looking Murtagh (Garett Hedlund), and The dwarf who is not short, King Hrothgar (Gary Lewis). Djimon Hounsou is also in it, being ticketed as one of the primary actors in the film, he, oddly enough got about 4 minutes of screen time, and absolutely no time to add any of his fantastic acting skills to the story. And finally we have Joss Stone, who is horrendously misplaced as a future-seeing witch, she obviously does not have acting skills and doesn't fit her character at all.One of the movies only good aspects was a relatively good soundtrack (aside from a utterly misplaced song by Avril Lavigne). But the soundtrack is not even anything close to saving the rest of the film.For the sake of ending my rant, this movie is just terrible regardless of it's source material and how faithful it was to it.2/10 stars, may God have mercy on all those who subject themselves to this garbage.","

"bondo256","23 December 2006","Horrible at best, Eragon conveys the fantasy of an adult with a 12-year-old mentality. Or maybe they just missed the LoTR money train. It seems as if the editor couldn't differentiate between what went on the floor and what stayed on the roll. As a result, Eragon is filled with lackluster scene cuts and sub-par acting. Also, one will be hard-pressed at determining the amount of time that elapses between the opening scene and the last. In short, save your money and treat your date to something more enjoyable, such as an outing at your favorite fast food restaurant followed by a trip down the slide. At least that will have more substance.","

"forallthecows","14 December 2006","I know what has been said about Paolini's immature writing style; personally, I read fantasy extensively and his books did not stand out in any way as being immature. It was well plotted, the characters had reasons for doing what they did and behaving in the way they did and these were all explained using narrative or action in the book; suspension of disbelief did the rest.I went to the movie expecting a reasonable attempt to transfer to the screen, the happenings in the book, which cover a relatively short time in Eragon's life; I was completely disappointed. The presence of Malkovich and Irons was welcome and they did a good job with what they were given, but therein lies the problem; they were given next to nothing at all.The plot was highly simplified from that of the book and changed into a lacklustre and hurried journey from one set piece from the book to another, leaving out most of the plot and character development that gives it all a reason. Some key elements of the storyline have changed or been omitted that are major foundations of Paolini's second book to the extent that I cannot see how the story from the second book can follow from this without the same shallow treatment.I will not be buying the DVD and I will take a lot of persuading to go and watch the sequel if it comes out. Overall, it was an expensive missed opportunity for the film makers and a huge disappointment.","

"claudio_carvalho","5 May 2007","The Kingdom of Alagaesia is ruled by the evil King Galbatorix (John Malkovich), a former dragon rider that betrayed his mates and his people in his quest for power. When the orphan farm boy Eragon (Ed Speleers) finds a blue stone sent by Princess Arya (Sienna Guillory), he sooner realizes that it is a dragon egg. When the dragon Saphira is born, Eragon meets his mentor Brom (Jeremy Irons), and becomes the dragon rider foreseen in an ancient prophecy that would set his people free from the tyrant Galbatorix. Eragon meets the rebels Varden and together they fight against the evil sorcerer Durza (Robert Carlyle) and the army of Galbatorix in a journey for freedom.""Eragon"" is a delightful adventure in a world of dragons and magic. I have never read the book, but adaptations of novels to the cinema are not easy, since the languages and the dynamics are different. Further and the most important, when we read a book we use our imagination to create the scenes and the landscapes, while in a movie we see what the director is able to show. I do not agree with the unfair and underrated IMDb User Rating since this movie is excellent: the cinematography, landscapes and special effects are awesome, disclosed in a perfect pace; there are magnificent lines; the cast is amazing, with names like Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich and Robert Carlyle acting with the unknown Ed Speelers and the gorgeous Sienna Guillory. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Eragon""","

"BobaFettFunnaGetYou","17 December 2006","I was so excited to go see Eragon, I'd been waiting for months and months after finally getting around to reading this combination of smash hits such as Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. It wasn't too bad. I had expected more, but I wasn't as deterred as some of the others grading this movie. And while I was more upset by changes to the story in this movie than any other I've seen to date, all in all, I enjoyed it. And I could have even enjoyed it more if they had STUCK TO THE STORY, at least more than 40%-50% of the time, and that's a generous estimate. Also, an hour and a half was too short to condense the book into, just a half hour more could have done wonders for this film. I did notice the sections of questionable acting, but they were no worse than some I saw in SW episode III. Special effects were great. My hope now is that if they don't change directors, the current one will learn from his mistakes and keep the reviews of Eragon in mind, and make Eldest and Empire great final films for this excellent trilogy.","

"normandbutter","16 December 2006","Crude, unimaginative adaptation of Christopher Paolini first novel is a bad joke from top to bottom. The screenplay is a joke, with major characters missing from the original novel and the acting from almost everybody in the film is down right horrible and that's really because most of the roles are miscast to begin with. Jeremy Irons makes an grant effort with what he has to work with but he's let down by the script and the bad performances of his co-stars and the only solid piece of real acting comes from the voice over work of Rachel Weisz, who gives the dragon Saphira enough charm, charisma, and strong will to make her the only believable and likable character in the entire film. That's in itself a great accomplishment considering the fact that script really does not even try to do that with itself.","

"overburn_rasial","12 February 2007","After seeing all the movies that have hit the market since 2000, i'd have to say that i'm rather disappointed with most of them. Most of the films reflect reality, but isn't reality what we're fleeing from when we want to relax, see a movie? The first Eragon book was written when the author was only 15 years old. Maybe that's why the movie is the best I have seen in years. Sometimes, children have a better view of what life should be like than adults. They are not so worn up by the hard parts of life. They live in their own imaginary world where anything is possible. Brom's death was really touching, not like in the movies where a character just dies, the other characters weep for 5 minutes and are back to their life. Don't you people understand that we don't need to see the cruel reality we see during our everyday lives?To conclude, this movie has a 10 from me. But most of that 10 goes to the book. The movie was an interpretation of the book, and the way the book is implemented into this film is outstanding.6 points to the book 4 points to the movieTogether they make a 10.","

"skoyles","8 January 2008","A couple of generations ago the Brits created a sword and sorcery romp called ""Krull"". I may have been one of two people on earth who liked it. ""Eragon"" may be this generation's much better version. I had no idea whether ""Eragon"" was based on a novel, a game or was original. I really do not care. This is a movie that is almost but not quite predictable, grabs one's emotions immediately and never lets go. Let me modify that: it grabs one if one is not a jaded cynic who has forgotten the wonder of dragons, flight, swords, magic and the panoply of growing up. It is another ""coming of age"" tale but not of the ""Eurotrip"" variety but of the classics, of the sagas, of that corner of many hearts that is forever honorable, courageous and wide-eyed with wonder at the marvel of existence. It is a twelve year olds' dream and an old man's memory of how things should have been. It is romance, beauty and valour. If only one can touch for the tiniest moment the innocence that we all lose far too soon, ""Eragon"" becomes a joy.","

Bad to the point of being funny, and then just sad... Mad for book lovers. However, watching this again I realize that it's a perfect model for how NOT to make a fantasy movie. Step-by-step, you can point out what's wrong with this piece of fiction and learn from it. Like the main being a Mary-Sue, and the typical races or substitute races, Jeremy Irons as the wise mentor, and the most evil villains since villainy. So yeah, you can play the drinking game or take the time to reflect on your own fiction and say, ""I can do better than this!""","

"Gordon-11","14 December 2006","This is a fantasy film about a teenager in a farming village being destined to become a dragon rider to fight against an evil king.The plot is easy to understand, and the characters' names and roles are prominently featured often enough to be remembered. The plot is an obvious fantasy but is not bizarre. The landscape of the rural countryside is breathtaking, especially the scene where Eragon and his companion ride on a horse on a spine of a mountain range.The special effects involving the dragon are excellent. The dragon moves seamlessly. The dragon's details down to the feathers and the shadows due to the direction of light are shown vividly. The ending sequences are intense, impressive and gripping, as if I really was in a battlefield! This is also helped by the fact that the soundtrack adequately complements the action in the film, without being too loud and noisy. To sum it up, the film is exciting and breathtaking! The only complaint I have is that most of the characters' voices, in particular Edward Speleers' and Rachel Weisz's are too over-the-top British, and too monotonous. If they could speak more naturally, it would be a big plus.","

"burning_magnesium","16 December 2006","(Spoilers contained too) OK!! Let me start by saying the movie was enjoyable. (Not necessarily good, but enjoyable).The first problem i had was the horrible dialog. E.g. ""We can do this together!! Together, nothing can stop us!! TOGETHER TOGETHER TOGETHER"". It sounded like some children's movie. Not something i'd expect a Dragon to say.. As noble as they are..The acting, apart from the part dialog was alright!! (JEREMY IRONS!! IS AWESOME!! as always!!) This is probably part of the script crappiness, but when Eragon wants to save those people, fervently, but gets distracted by training.. lol I didn't get that.. That and how he wanted to save the chick in his dream (Note: I have not read the books, i do not know the names). So it'll stay at the chick in his dream. The only motive he had from that was the clairvoyant, and the actual dream.. With the knowledge that he has to go into an enemy castle.. Which he has no knowledge of the layout etc etc.. The motive for all of it was unclear.. if i might add, Eragon.. The character (in the movie) seems a little confused.. and emotionally unstable. And should probably see a psychologist, or Psychiatrist of some sort.. All these things seem to happen to him.. But, he seems to hold no emotion after it happens.. After the initial thing with his uncle dying.. He was fine in the next scene.. problem child? I think so!! All in all.. I think this was rushed.. 90% running around in the countryside, 10% fight scenes. The fight scenes were alright.. The costumes and props weren't too bad. I liked the style they picked for the Varden..Lastly, (Spoiler bit).Did anyone see the part where they had the crossbowmen at the little bridge before the enemy people burst through? I swear that the one behind the other one had a clear shot at his head.. lol What's up with that? back guy, ""If you run away, i'll shoot you!!"", Front guy, ""Not if you run away first!"".Jeremy","

"alexjonlin","14 January 2007","Eragon was pretty much terrible. I loved the book, but I'd say 75% of the book was cut out for the movie. I expected them to cut it out, but cutting out that much? And of the scenes that they did include, almost all of them were nothing like the book. They spent way to much of the movie in Carvahall, then raced through the rest of the story, all leading up to the climax, which literally lasted about 30 seconds. The scenery was also bad, with a lot of the key elements described in the book not there. I really wish someone had done a better job, because it gives a bad name to Eragon, which was a great book. All in all, if you have not seen this movie yet, you should not see it, as it is nothing like the book.","

"koz-10","18 December 2006","This movie set a new standard in bad. In fact the word 'bad', with a mere three letters, cannot encapsulate how God-awful this film truly is. When I tell you I'd rather sit through Ultraviolet or Aeon Flux again, that should give you some measure of what I mean by 'bad'.Anyway, I never read the book (which by all accounts has no bearing on the film anyway), so here's my take on the plot...The legitimate ruler of a Kingdom is facing a political and military crisis. Neighbouring (rogue) states conspire against his rule, fomenting trouble. Naturally, to preserve freedom, some sacrifices must be made and the rule of law must prevail.Enter the main character, a young idealist who gets caught up in the intrigue when a Weapon of Mass Destruction, stolen from the King's armoury falls into his possession. Abetted by a grizzled traitor, they seek to deliver the WMD to one of the neighbouring states where the terrorists have their haven.The King, quite naturally, sends his troops to the distant land to wage his War on Terror and to locate the missing WMD and, well, stuff happens.But none of it is remotely interesting so I won't bore you with the details. My only advice is, when faced with the possibility of seeing this film, your best bet would be to feign death convincingly.","

"alhoot","24 April 2007","I was very disappointed by this movie. Special effects were the main focus. Character development, relationships between characters and storyline were lacking. The story was so condensed it was hard to follow. The characters and story bear little resemblance to the book, other than they share the same names. For example, Brom appeared early in the movie as a rather seedy looking ""poacher"" and had little development. In the book Brom's character was more noble and had many aspects, none of which were like the movie. The hero and the villains were unconvincing. Some of the hero's actions while flying were so ridiculous they should have been in a cartoon. Many of the changes from the book were at the expense of plot and character development. How did the the butcher know that Eragon's stone was the King's stone?","

"Caitan","21 December 2006","I can say that I am a big fan of dragons and love the books of Eragon. I guess most of you can imagine my joy when I heard of Eragon - The Movie for the first time. But then came ""The moment of truth"" when I sat in our cinema with a coke in my hands. Thank goodness my chair had a drink-holder otherwise I might have ruined the carpet. Excuse me but did someone drop the story in a shredder? Turned it on and poured the snippets on a film roll?? What happened to the story? Will there be a special ""Extended Version""? Something like ""Directors cut""? Did we all just see a 90 minutes trailer of a greater film? I hope so because what I had seen was a senseless puzzle of Eragon scenes. Another riddle: Did the film crew put 90% of the budget into the development of the dragon? The dragon was awesome but the rest... only disappointing. I asked my friends if they have recognized the protagonists (besides Eragon and Arya): Galbatorix, Ajihad, Murtagh, Angela ... but they asked me, if they are of any relevance for the story. So much for a story. Where did all the dwarfs go? Had anybody seen the Mage-twins or Angelas were-cat?To be honest: save your money and buy the book, if you are interested in a true and epic story.The 2 Points are for the magnificent dragon, everything else was just disappointing","

"anda-alexandra-86","10 November 2015","Brom: narrating - There was a time when the fierce and beautiful land of Alagaësia was ruled by men astride mighty dragons. To protect and serve was their mission, and for thousands of years, the people prospered. But the Riders grew arrogant, and began to fight among themselves for power. Sensing their weakness, a young Rider named Galbatorix betrayed them, and in a single bloody battle, believed he had killed them all, Riders and dragons alike. Since then, our land has been ruled by Galbatorix. He crushed all rebellion, including the freedom fighters known as the Varden. Those that survived fled to the mountains. There, they hoped for a miracle that might even their odds against the king. Our story begins one night, as Arya, an ally of the Varden, rides for her life, carrying a stone stolen from the king himself...Oh, alrighty there! Let me just say that this is how the movie starts, with Brom telling the story of Alagaësia. All good there, Jeremy Irons (who plays Brom like a charm) has a soothing voice that beckons you to sit down and listen to his stories, but what he says is not entirely by the book and if you read the book first - like I did - you might get upset. The Riders did not grew arrogant and they did not fight between themselves until Galbatorix came along and began to act high and mighty! He is the reason the Riders were killed and the dragons as well. And Arya - who is an elf - did not steal the stone stolen from the king. She was guarding it for many years. The stone was actually a dragon egg - one of the 3 in the books that still remained unhatched! - that was carried back and forward between the elves and the dwarfs - which, by the way, do not appear at all in the movie! but in the book they hold a great part of the story. But never-mind that","

"eldergod-1","11 December 2006","This is possibly the fastest fantasy movie in history. The characters are likable and the villains are terrifying and scary, especially King Galbatorix. Jeremy Irons does a magnificent job as Brom, the old storyteller. It is true that the movie is very different from the book, but it is the same with ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter"". Books are one thing, movies another. The book is long epic fantasy, the movie is fast, hearth-stopping action. Now I heard predictions that the movie won't be as huge as Narnia or Harry Potter. Maybe this is true, but this means nothing. Eragon is a great movie and fantasy -fans will love it.","

"addo_07","29 December 2006","I can't believe all these people who have said terrible things about the film! I went to see Eragon with my Dad for his birthday, we have both read the book, and both really enjoyed the film. What we as an audience have to understand that it is a film BASED ON the novel by Christopher Paolini. I am a young actor, and looking at it from an actors point of view i thought that the performances from the actors were far from lack-lustre and boring as they have been described as by other users. Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich both give fantastic performances, but by far the best performance is given by Robert Carlyle as Durza: Absolutely spine-tingly! Yes the boy playing Eragon wasn't as good as he could have been, but his performance within the context of the film isn't particularly bad. This film for me thoroughly brightened up an otherwise dull December day! I'd see it again any day!!!","

"Cinemibus","25 December 2009","This is a textbook example of what happens when a film maker tries to imitate another film seemingly without any idea of what made the other film such a success. In this case the other film is The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the wannabe is Eragon, based on the best-selling fantasy novel by Christopher Paolini. The younger actors' names you will probably not recognize. This is because they were selected for looks, not acting skill. However, one would expect the older actors to do a decent job in their roles. As it is only Jeremy Irons pulls through, a bastion of entertainment over a sea of incompetence. Malkovich and Carlyle, meanwhile, provide two hilariously campy performances as the baddies and the rest seem to be barely acting at all. Perhaps this is partially due to the script, which gives Malkovich the unforgettably bad opening line, ""I suffer without my stone. Do not prolong my suffering."" I suppose he does his best, as do they all, but only Irons manages to put a vaguely humorous spin on the whole ordeal, adding personality to his character that it seems the screenplay was not kind enough to provide. The direction is bad, the acting is (mostly) bad, the screenplay is hopeless, and I could go on and on. Bottom line: Eragon is a disappointing entry in the fantasy genre that represents the utter ineptitude of its makers.","

The plot was stupid and way off of the books course, Galbatorix looked like a complete joke Brom was lame Eragon too happy for a boy who suffered the loss he did, in fact none of the characters fit the part but i did enjoy the dragon Saphira the way she looked in the movie was cool but other than that everything else failed.I hope they understand how badly they failed and do not attempt to make a second movie they should have that movie be a stand alone and try again with more effort because this made me angry at how badly they did.","

"twisted_little_star84","23 December 2006","I went to see this movie with really bad expectations after hearing on these boards how terrible this movie is. But I actually found it amazing.I think the story is a little too cliché, but it works for the most part. If Harry Potter, Narnia and Lord Of The Rings can pull these kind of clichés off, then Eragon can too.The actors were good enough with what they got. Jeremy Irons did an amazing job as Brom. John Malkovich was good but had too few scenes. He should at least have had a dozen more. Ed Speelers was really good as Eragon. But the scene stealer was the CGI dragon Saphira. It was just amazing to see this dragon live and breathe. The rest of the FX were really good too, but Saphira is what makes this movie soar.The negative things are the movie is too short and it feels a little gutted. Also it wouldn't hurt that actors like John Malkovich and Djimon Hounsou are given a little more to do. But all in all this is a very good movie.I don't understand all the negativity it is getting because that is undeserved. Looking forward too the next one (hopefully it will be made).","

The only thing, and then I mean the ONLY thing, thats similar to the book, is the characters' names. The rest is just made up as they saw fit. Not even the storyline is the same.Apart from not being true to the book, the film was of poor entertainment and with bad acting. Most of the characters are taken right out of a 'Xena - The Warrior Princess' episode. The ""heroes"" look like cheap soap opera actors, and the villains like brainless cartoon idiots.The only ones who will find this film entertaining are the children, all mature audience should stay clear, or rent the DVD when it comes out.

Get better actors and get a better director and you will have something. My advice...produce the movie again .

"thrads","5 December 2006","Say what you will, but Eragon can be a compelling story regardless of what you think it ripped off. With that in mind, I give you Edward Speelers...who probably wouldn't know something compelling if it hit him in the face. In fact, I doubt he would even flinch if something hit him in the face. The biggest problem with Eragon is who plays Eragon himself.There's an innocence-turned-hard required for this role, but Speelers has one facial gesture: solemnity. When he laughs or smiles or cries (tries to, anyway), it is not believable. He is as wooden a leading actor that I have ever seen in a mainstream film. The fact that the story and the movie is carried upon his shoulders is a problem.The rest of the performances are at least a little better; John Malkovich chews up the scenery like no other, and it works here. Carlyle's Durza is truly a menace, even though his most prominent scenes are often shrouded in special effects.That is another thing: the special effects. Some are absolutely stunning (Saphira, the journey through the mountains), yet some are so shoddy that they make you roll your eyes. It's almost as if the filmmakers spent far too much time on Saphira and the accompanying flying scenes to be bothered to put much effort into the rest of them.In summary, it can be thrilling and visually stimulating at times, but Speelers falls so flat that it ultimately is forgettable. It's a shame that this is a such a mediocre film.","

Whomever decided that this movie should have been produced in this fashion should be shot! Weird Al could have done better! Not only should the screenwriter have at the very least read the book, but the producer/director should have read it as well. NONE of the important content from the book was included. The time-lines were completely off.Brom taught the wrong spells to the kid. The saddle was a leather horse saddle and could never be passed off as rope saddle designed to let a rider ride WITH the dragon, as opposed to only being an unwitting passenger. Arya seemed infatuated with Erragon. Why was she even conscious before they reached the varden? Brom died in a cave with Saphira and Murtagh. They never even crossed a freaking desert so Erragon could get water from the sand! The giant crystal was never broken. The wound from the shade was totally glossed over. Ajihad never died, his daughter never came to power. Erragon never allied with the Varden. The Dwarf helm was never presented. The Adoption never occurred. And Arya left for Du Weldenvarden without the Dwarf and Erragon.ARYA (the elf) HAD HUMAN EARS IN THE MOVIE! WHAT ELF DOESN'T HAVE POINTY EARS! I am so saddened that Chris P. sold off the rights and did not retain creative control over these projects. They are not even a shadow of what he depicted in his book. They could have done much much better had the done Erragon in 2 parts. I hope someone throws this version out and the redo the whole thing.

No, the acting isn't bad, but it can be seen the director had no real experience in telling the actors what to do. No, the pacing isn't bad, but it simply isn't too interesting. Sorry, Eragon fans, but this movie - differing a bit from the book which it runs through - shows even more clearly that the story is simply a rip-off of Star Wars IV: A New Hope. No, I don't think it would be a problem if it was spectacular enough (e.g. the castles and cities are only 2-second inbetweens; it's like in TV shows when you see actors in studios and for some seconds they show the city/building they are supposed to be in), if it had enough tiny details that could make us amazed and let us forget the way too obvious similarities in the plot. Patrick Doyle's music is dynamic and emotional; too bad the movie is not - and as they just run through the story we really can't feel anything for the characters, we can't even know the world of Algäesia (we can hear there are elves and dwarfs etc., but can't really see or separate them from humans). There is nothing really bad in this movie; but certainly there is nothing memorable. If they want to make a trilogy they should try harder.","

The acting , especially the lead, is wooden. Some of the lines were incredibly corny. The action scenes were small scale and nothing even close to even the smallest action scenes from LOTR. Im sorry to have to raise that movie, but any director making fantasy films has to be aware that that is now the movie by which all other fantasy movies will now be benchmarked. And in that respect, it falls short in practically all respects.There is no character development either. Which is sad considering the characters in the book were quite well developed.In short, don't waste money going to see this at the cinema. Don't even waste money on the DVD.

While I feel the book is fairly lackluster in writing the plot is interesting enough. The film doesn't really even have that going for it. As bad an idea as it is in the Oregon Trail, setting the pace to grueling is poor here as well. The pacing seems rushed and never gives the viewer a chance to connect and care about any of the characters. So when certain characters die or change or whatever there is no emotional impact. Being a first time director, Stefen Fangmeier does not yet know how to be an effective storyteller. Probably also due to Fangmeier's inexperience the performances seem set on autopilot. If word of mouth has any effect, after opening day this movie seems poised for deserved failure. A shame that this trilogy just can't get off the ground.","

And to people out there who think that it's a cheap knock-off for Star Wars: A New Hope or Lord of the Rings, it is not. All the elements just go together really well. I also really liked Saphira, not just because she is a dragon, but because she is a very complex character. She can be gentle and majestic at the same time. So all of you haters out there, shut your mouths and get a life.","

"Sharingan_Kakashi","14 January 2007","I heard the books were great. Now, I know for a fact that no movie really captures the essence of a well written book, but sometimes there is a little appreciation for whats done. At least, it would make you more interested in researching some detail you think the book might be able to explain better. Eragon does NOT!!! My friend gave me the first book to read right before the movie came out, so obviously I went to watch the movie first. One, it had dragons and two, SIENNA GUILLORY was starring in it. There was no new upcoming great acts from any of the cast. No new upcoming OK acts either. Not recommended at the least from me as I was SHAMED when coming out of the theatres from dragging my friends into what I thought might be a ""GRRREAT"" movie. It was the quietest and longest ride back home from the theatre. EDITORS NOTE: When Sienna doesn't have a jaw dropping first appearance (I just mean she didn't look hot!) in the movie (like in Resident Evil 2), then there is something wrong already. She should stick to short shorts, dark hair, and a tight blue top!!!!!","

"jswenson_11","29 December 2007","I read the review for Eragon, and assumed that this movie was gonna be a load of crud. So, I didn't bother to see it in the theaters, and instead waited for it to come to DVD and rent it. I went to Hollywood to rent this, hoping it was going to be worth my 6$, and not a load of crap like the reviews had suggested. I had pretty low expectations for this, because of the reviews.Was I wrong!Eragon, although not very true too the book, was still a fast-paced fantasy movie. It has some of the best special effects that I've seen in a while. While I wish it could've stayed a little more to the book, Eragon was worth 6$. After I'd finished watching the movie, I kept thinking why I hadn't gone to see Eragon it theaters.I'd give it 3 out of 4 for story. 4 out of 4 for special effects. And 2 out of 4 for staying true to the book.Overall, I'd give it 3 out of 4 stars.","

"sweettart656","23 December 2006","This movie was so horrible.It was NOTHING like the book and it skipped so many important parts.The acting was not that good except Jeremy Irons(Brom) and Rachel Weiz(Saphira) but a lot of the lines were corny and made no sense.They also made really important characters in the book minor roles in the movie.Then there were parts in the movie that didn't make sense and they didn't even explain why or how it happened.For example there is one part in the movie where Eragon(Speleers)is trying to get baby Saphira(Weiz) to fly.So he throws her up into the air and then when she comes down she is full grown and bigger than a house.I checked and that was NOT in the book.It was just depressing.So my advice is if you is that if you really want to see this movie wait till it comes out on DVD or video.I hope before they make the sequel ""Eldest"" they will try to write a good screenplay,get more experienced actors to play the lead characters(Ed Speleers for example),make it longer, and don't take only a few months to make it.","

It begins with a really great scene , its the best opening scene in a movie , and it ends with great and wonderful end . I specially loved the evil witch he was awesome . at the end i really loved this movie and shortly ""eragon is my second favorite movie ever (the best is pirates 2)"" . go watch eragon even if you haven't read the book i am sure you will enjoy it","

THEY TOOK A GOOD BOOK AND TOTALLY KILLED It, WHERE IS THAT WRITER!?!?! I WANT TO CHOKE EM!"" Yeah, its that bad. OK I read Eragon and I ate it up like a lion who didn't have breakfast. Then I saw the movie. And I feel bad for the author. (i forgot his name) I was afraid this would happen. And it did. I could tell from the trailer that they had already screwed everything up. Like I said if you read the book don't see the movie, so if you didn't read it, you don't know how badly they took a fine story and chew it up, sallowed it, and threw it up.OK really? the actor for eragon totally fits the character, not, and not to mention the stupid looking clothes he wore almost the entire movie. And non of the cooler, more important characters were never seen! it was almost as if they were never there.I am sorry but it was horrible, if i were to describe it in one word it would be ""sucked""","

"D-Devine","24 December 2006","I had relatively high expectations going into the theater, and frankly, they weren't met. The reason I gave it this rating rating was because I read the book and there was just no comparison between the two. The book had suspense and flowed nicely, while the movie skipped a lot of scenes and jumped from scene to scene way to quickly. I'm not saying it was terrible, no matter what a two means, its just that I didn't think it really deserved to be called ""Eragon"" when it barely followed the book at all, so to someone who never read the book, the movie may have been awesome. In conclusion, I think that the movie should have followed the book better. I would not recommend bothering to go to this one if you are someone who gets disappointed when a movie doesn't follow the book it is supposed to based on, like me.","

"falconeio","24 December 2006","Eragon is an amazing book that draws you in and keeps you hanging on as you tread through its words and pages. What this director and screenplay writer did to the story was an injustice. They ripped out 85% of the book, blended the rest to their bad tastes and then inserted a really bad medieval version of Star Wars: Episode II. This should have been been a grand adventure of a boy and dragon fighting against untenable enemies, it should be the story of a boy and teacher, amazing cities, races colliding with each other in great battles. What instead was fed to us were mud-hole villages, every race mashed together into different badly dressed humans with grime as an excuse for real makeup, a storyline so badly butchered that the only thing it has in common with it's book are the names given to things and characters and a story that is so thin a baby's breath could rip it asunder. The writer and director were a sorry choice for a movie that could have been one of the top movies of the year, the only hope this movie has of ever having it's sequels were if the movie were rewritten and remade with a real director and writer this time. So I must conclude with something I never though I would say, don't see Eragon, it is a waste of money.","

"jojolydsieandbean","21 December 2006","This movie was adapted worse than Harry Potter was. And that's saying something. Honestly, if they'd renamed the characters and title, I would have NO IDEA it was Eragon. Sure, the movie's entertaining enough, but only if you don't think of it as 'Eragon'; if you do, you're most likely to run out of the theater ripping your hair out and screaming. I restrained myself from doing this, but I couldn't stop myself from laughing loudly at the dead serious parts; I had to let out the hysteria that was building up SOMEHOW. The way they twisted the facts around (even the simple ones) left it with no possible way of making a movie of 'Eldest' (the sequel to 'Eragon'); or if they did, they'd have to make up the script entirely, with no help from the book. My 6-year-old sister enjoyed this, so I suppose it's an entertaining adventure for youngsters, but if you've read the book you're much better off not seeing the movie. If I were Christopher Paolini, I'd be dead from horror.","

"Aldaron","16 December 2006","I can't believe this film was made. I'm even more astonished that Lucasfilm has thus-far failed to drag 20th Century Fox into court.This film is, in short, a complete and unashamed copy of ""Star Wars"", from start to finish. Pick anywhere in the film, and you will see it. The farmboy who intercepts an important thing, delivered by a princess escaping the clutches of the evil ruler. A retired mystical warrior who teaches this boy that he, too, is possessed of the same special powers and destined to join the rebellion against the evil king, who, strangely enough, was once one of these noble guardians of peace and justice in the gal...err...""world"" before he turned to evil and betrayed his peers.The list goes on. ""Derivative"" is far too kind. ""Rip-off"" is closer to the truth.And that's even ignoring a movie so snooze-inducing that it made ""The Phantom Menace"" look like a brilliantly-produced and directed work of cinema art.Do yourself a favour and hold off seeing this at the cinema. The kids will probably love it, but you need to save money by renting it on DVD, and that way you can also go and make coffee in the squirm-inducing scenes of discomfort with 31 year-old Sienna Guillory making doe-eyes at 18-year-old (but 15-looking) Edward Speleers...Actually, no. Just put on ""Star Wars"" again. It's the same thing, anyway, and has better music...","

"trond-gjeset","17 December 2006","First of all let me tell you this. I did read the book and i knew that i would be a bit disappointed of the movie as they rarely measure up to the book they sometimes are made from. Second of all i gotta say that i was TERRIBLY disappointed by this movie, i found myself pondering if mr. Stefen Fangmeier even read it before deciding to direct a movie from it. The timeline was all messed up and i saw characters who never even met in the book meet each other in the film not to mention doing things that are CLEARLY stated IMPOSSIBLE in the book. And how are we supposed to see the difference between races when Humans and Elves look so similar, everyone know elves have pointy ears! The only bright spots i saw in this film was actually good effects (although locations wheren't as good as they could have been such as Farthern Dur), Character selections (which i would have used should i have made it myself) and the most charming little baby dragon that i fell in love with despite the few minutes we actually got to see her.This movie could have been a lot better as it is and to top of that i'm disappointed that they didn't make it longer giving room for more time to get to know the characters. I didn't get to see ANYTHING of Eragon that i recognized from the book and i don't blame the actor, i blame the SCRIPT!","

Those who don't like it shouldn't be on this website, because if you don't like something then there's no reason to go to a web page dedicated to it. See this movie, it is beautifully done and if you buy the two disk special edition, watch all of the second disk, it will give you a greater appreciation for it.

Not only was there absolutely no character development but the film didn't follow the books plot in the slightest way. Anybody who is a fan of these great books will most likely walk away from this movie with second hand embarrassment for the director. To even think that this movie could be under 2 hours is insanity, so much crucial back story and character introduction was cut from the movie. And what the hell was that fight all about at the end with Durza? what happened to Eragon getting his back sliced open? What happened the giant gem ceiling of the dwarf kingdom. i mean honestly, how can this director sleep at night knowing he has made such a mess of this highly anticipated film. This man has killed the trilogy before it even got going, especially since the movie doesn't even end in a way that sets up the second book accurately. Very disappointing.","

Also because of the well known and very seasoned actors that where in it. We expected great things however watching this movie was awful. The well known, seasoned actors seemed so out of place in this awful, awful production of a movie. Every scene seemed to come right out of another well known movie, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Legend, The last of the Mohicans, just to name a few. We half expected the main character of this movie to run into the cast of Lord of the rings in parts, it was just that bad. And as for the costumes, they where like something out of Bollywood, tacky and over the top for this particular setting and time. How Djimon Hounsou could stand to wear the outfit he did is beyond me! The make up and costumes where something else throughout! If I can give anyone anything for Christmas this year, it will be the knowledge of how badly this movie sucks!!!Don't waste your money.

"chaoticcranium","6 January 2007","Seen Star Wars Episode 4? Good. Now, change it to a Lord of the Rings-esquire setting and throw in a l33t dragon and you have Eragon.To prove my point, here's a brief summary from what I recall: (SPOILERS) The world is ruled by the evil, dictatorial Emperor Galbatorix (ie, Palpatine). Princess Arya (ie, Leia) steals a dragon egg (ie, the Death Star plans) from the emperor, and Galbatorix sends his right hand man, Durza (ie, Darth Vader), a Shade wizard to pursue her. Before being captured by Durza, Arya teleports the egg. Enter a farm boy who lives on his uncle's farm named Eragon (ie, Luke Skywalker). He finds the egg, and it later hatches into a dragon named Saphira. The empire's soldiers figure out where the egg went and they raid the village. However, the boy is saved by an old mentorish figure named Obi Wan-- er, I mean Brom. It turns out that Brom lived in an era where dragons and humans coexisted and that he was one of the elite dragon riders. Galbatorix too was a dragon rider in this period, but he used his power to stage a revolution. Since then, Brom lost the life of his dragon and everything else he held dear. Anyway, Brom and Eragon flee to some port city (ie, Mos Eisley), where Eragon learns how to use magic to save Brom. They then head for the headquarters of the resistance against the empire (ie, Yavin IV), but when Eragon receives a dream of Arya's demise in the evil empire's captial (ie, Death Star), he abandons Brom and takes off for the castle. He sneaks in and finds the princess, but the wizard Durza locates him and engages him. Eragon survives, however, with the sacrifice of Brom (he even dies the same as Obi Wan) and the help of Saphira and a rogue named Murtagh (ie, Han Solo), who was the child of a dragon rider who supported Galbatorix but does not believe in his father's ideals. He flees with the princess, who has been cursed, Saphira, and Murtagh. They reach the resistance bade and the princess is healed from the curse. However, Durza uses them to locate the base, and he sends his soldiers to try to eliminate them. A grandiose battle ensues, and Eragon engages Durza and defeats him. Fin.Now, I happened to enjoy the movie, but as I have demonstrated, this movie drastically lacks originality - it follows the same archetypical epic that Star Wars Episode IV pioneered (at least, in the movie business). You've all seen this plot before, and it is getting stale. The special effects are great, but the dialogue is corny (also like Star Wars, but it was forgivable for its time). Acting is decent, but without substance its really just a waste. I haven't read the book, but I hear the film's plot departs substantially from it. I also hear the book is far more original and entertaining then the movie.","

"Hotty91488","18 December 2006","This movie was probably the biggest let down next to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Why?!- How?! Could Christopher Paolini allow someone to make a complete catastrophe out of his beautiful, hard work?!? Eragon and the Eldest are the fantasy books for the new generations and the movie is a complete failure! Even those who have not read the book asked if it jumped around a lot because it did not make sense. The script was poorly written, the wardrobe did not suite the time period  I mean, Roran was the only person wearing blue pants. I think they were jeans even! The makeup artist(s) did a god awful job on the Urgals. They were men with paint on them I can do that on Halloween! There were no dwarfs at all! How disappointing! What? Do the screen writers have something against what Peter Jackson did in Lord of the Rings? Because at least he put effort into his movie and didn't spend more on advertising than the production of the film! I was hoping for something spectacular, a movie that could try to live up to Lord of the Rings or Pirates of the Carrabiean but there is no hope! An entirely new crew needs to make the Eldest because Eragon has bombed there is no way that the Eldest will even make box-office its first weekend if the same people create the second movie. When it comes to making a great movie people are looking for the appearance of it. I will give credit to the graphic design on Saphira she was awesome and so was Jeremy Irons he's a wonderful actor. Sadly, the writers decided to make Brom the evil teacher in the book, Brom and Eragon gain a certain understanding and bond there was nothing like that in the movie! Also, what was with the elf?! She didn't look like and elf. She had red hair instead of black and she didn't have pointed ears that's what makes an elf an elf F.Y.I! Can we send an emergency message to Peter Jackson or George Lucas that there are fans looking for their beautiful, flawless, expertise on movies, PLEASE!","

Director Stefen Fangmeier, Screenplay Peter Buchman.This is the long-awaited film adaptation of Christopher Paolini's Eragon novels. Paolini began writing the books at the age of 17. To some, this film is heaven, especially if you are drawn to the mainstream fantasy genre. To others, this film appears to be full of the predictable ""Lord of the Rings"" type of material and nothing special. Peter Buchman wrote the screenplay (perhaps a big mistake) and not Paolini himself, and the film was directed by European director Stefen Fangmeier. The premise: A beautiful world, once governed by benevolent and wise dragon-riders, has fallen under the dark power of a traitor dragon-rider Galbatorix (John Malkovich). The remaining riders, known as the Varden, retreated to a hidden mountain fortress where they await the coming of a hero who will ride a dragon and defeat Galbatorix and his evil dragon. This hero is none other than Eragon, a humble farm boy who happens to find a dragon's egg, changing his life forever. Clearly, there are echoes of both Lord of the Rings and Star Wars here, at least in the rebels vs empire sort of way, which is why some detractors bash this film, but in all fairness, it might be mere coincidence. The dragon is the female Saphira (voice of Rachel Weisz). Before long, Eragon sets off on his quest to defeat the wicked sorcerer Shade (Robert Carlyle) and save the beautiful captive Arya (Sienna Guillory). This is a wonderful fantasy film, though not a faithful and loving tribute to Paolini's novel, thanks to the Hollywood signature on it- namely the dazzling special effects and computer enhanced imagery, such as the dragon itself. But the cinematography by Hugh Johnson is breathtaking. The vistas of nature- thick forests, mountains, waterfalls, etc- make this film a winner in my opinion. The original music by Patrick Doyle is both intense and touching. So, even if you've had enough of Lord of the Rings or Chronicles of Narnia, both series which have fared well in the box-office, you might just find yourself enjoying Eragon.","

"jau-zeng","15 December 2006","Just saw this movie in Malaysia since it has just come out here and it was great! I didn't know what to expect and had only seen the trailer beforehand and was impressed with the great cast. Plus I hadn't read the book so went in with a pretty fresh palate without any expectation.Thoroughly enjoyed it. The CGI for the dragon was very well done and very convincing. It would have been easy for the graphics to spoil the movie but in this case, it didn't.The action sequences were exciting and well put together. One would expect a movie like this to lack some sort of feeling or emotion but it achieved the goal of making you feel for the characters.Another strong point of the movie was the breathtaking scenery and the way it was shot was something to behold. The best way to see this movie is in a big cinema with a big screen. Actually, an IMAX version of it would be awesome! The only downside (hence the 9 stars) was some of the voice work done by for the dragon and perhaps that was due to the script being a little bit off (and at moments, cheesy). But that didn't really ruin the whole feel.I recommend it not only to people who like fantasy but also to those who just like to get lost in a movie. It flows well and there aren't too many moments to get bored in. Plus, people who haven't read the book won't lose out.","

"brettchatz-1","15 December 2006","Film Review: Eragon Cast: John Malkovich; Jeremy Irons; Edward Speleers and Sienna Guillory Eragon tells the tale of Dragon Riders  the protectors of society.In a faraway land, in medieval times, an evil King rules the roost with an iron-fist. Aided by his horrid sorcerer, the King wreaks havoc in his fiefdom. Blatant theft, punitive taxation and the draft are some of the hateful practices people have to endure.But, it was not always so.The sanctity of the Kingdom was previously safeguarded by a noble group of law-abiding Dragon Riders. For many years these Riders protected the people from wrongdoing. Eventually however, one such Dragon Rider desired all the power for himself. He set out on a mission to rid the Kingdom of all its protectors. The solitary remaining Dragon belonged to none other than the evil King himself.The resistance movement went into hiding, fearing for their lives.Many years later one Dragon egg is stolen from the Royal Palace. The King's beastly henchmen are sent on a mission to find the guardian of the hatchling and kill him. So begins a tale of epic proportions; with Eragon as the last Dragon Rider.The film is a marvel to behold. It is simply fantastic. The visual effects are spellbinding and the action is relentless. Jeremy Irons is superbly cast as a fallen Rider who guides the impressionable Eragon in his journey towards righteousness and wisdom.If fantasy and adventure are your forte, then Eragon is the Holiday film to be seen!","

"frederique-carre","1 April 2007","My children read the book and really wanted to go watch the movie. I went with them and was expecting something that would remind me of the Lord of the Rings. I was very disappointed with Eragon.While special effects are good and the dragon has a real personality, the other actors don't seem to belong in the movie. I like Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich very much but their performance in this movie is just not at their usual level. While Peter Jackson was inspired when he picked Elijah Wood to play Frodo in Lord of the Rings, Ed Speleers does not manage to convince the audience as Eragon.But the worst part is really the scenario. I regularly watch movies thinking that they were too long and the director could have removed some scenes. In the case of Eragon, the movie is far too short, not allowing time to develop the various characters. Eragon seems to turn overnight into a hero with magic power while the book (my children told me) spent a lot of time showing the transformation of the farm boy into a dragon rider.The end of the movie calls for an ""Eragon 2"" but I hope that the producers will bring huge improvements to the scenario, the cast and the direction. My 14 year old daughter hated the movie (mainly because of the scenario) and my 11 year old son liked the movie (mainly for the special effects). It looks like I will be on duty for ""Eragon 2"", so hopefully the producers will read the reviews or will give up on the 2nd part!","

I expected more from him. The entire movie jumps around and I often wondered how they got from point A to point B. There were people who had not read this book in the audience and in the lobby they were wondering about the characters and the plot. They also felt as if something was missing. The movie was only 104 minutes long...they could have made it longer and resolved some of the storyline problems.The following are plot ""problems"" whereby the director changed the story line to fit his needs, and these are just a few...if this is ""poetic license"" he's not a poet and he doesn't have a license. 1. Roran tells Eragon he is leaving the farm and then tells his father not the other way around and Eragon is extremely unhappy that he is being left on the farm. 2. Eragon ""discovers"" Saphira is a female when he is trying to name her...he does not know she is a female until this happens. 3. Eragon ""names"" Saphira...she doesn't tell him her name. 4. What happened to Katrina? She wasn't even in the story and she was a major player relative to Roran. 5. What happened to Roran? Where did he go? 6. The director makes it look like Eragon and Arya will be lovers and she wants him to be a Dragon rider not her friend/lover forever. Eragon is smitten with her, not the other way around. 7. in the final battle, Durza wounds Eragon horribly across his back...this was completely left out. 8. The Ergols were not just big fat bad bald men...they were similar to Orcs from LOTR. 9. Eragon doesn't just instinctively know magic...Brom has to teach him this and everything else before he dies. 10. Saphira doesn't just grow from 10 pounds to 1000 pounds in one single flight...thats a crock all by itself.2 thumbs down for this flick.","

"kazryv","16 December 2006","Watched this movie over the weekend thinking that it might be not too bad. The book was relatively decent so I assumed the movie form would be fun to watch as well. The movie was nothing like the book. The script writer for this movie added and cut scenes where he saw fit. Omitted parts of the story that would have added to the movie and made it make more sense. The movie seemed full of cheesy one liners. The fighting scenes were terrible, and some of the key fighting scenes seemed to be made from pieces of other movies. If you read the book and enjoyed it then don't waste your time with the movie. If you want to see the movie, you may wish to consider only reading the book because it makes more sense and is a far more enjoyable read.","

"Tarantinoesque","17 December 2006","This film was meant to be an epic. The book is 500 pages long, the film, an hour and forty minutes. The movie looked as if it was filmed as it was supposed to be shown, then the beginnings and endings of each scene was scrapped. What is left is a skeleton of a film with actors lacking in talent, and dialogue lacking in luster or originality. The rapid pace of the film left the audience emotionally disconnected from each character, and unable to understand character relations. In the end, this is a film for children, not adults; children are the only people who will be able to sit through the entirety of such a poor film just to see a dragon (who by the way you'll be praying to die after hearing its string of unusually clichéd one-line comebacks.)","

"Hsm2012-1","18 December 2006","I think that it is OK. Based on the book where a boy finds a stone while hunting in the Spine. They nailed that. He hides it from his Uncle and Cousin Roran ( Chris Egan ). And protecting his dragon his uncle dies. They nailed that too! Then Bron ( Jeremy Irons ) takes Eragon ( Ed Speleers) under his wing and guides him in magic, sword skills, and Dragon ways. They follow KEY POINTS of the book. They leave out traveling time, minor scrambles and the desert. They also don't spend time used in the book to describe everything! It maybe be a bad movie for some people. But, some people may like it. I respect all, and I know that it wasn't perfect. You need to give people more credit. They spent months working on this and all you can do is dis it. Think about what they go through, its not just fun. They did also leave out the cat and Katrina. Even though they credit her. I hope to see Eldest in theaters and I also hope to see Eragon on DVD. Its worth thinking about seeing, but not twice. And remember, nothings better than reading the book.","

"Youngbuck11","16 December 2006","I was a semi-fan of the book, but realized it's cliché's and realized that it wasn't anything extremely special, so I really didn't care how close they kept the film to the book.I already knew the film would be cliché, as it is based on a cliché novel. But I really wanted this film to be fun and I wanted to see a good dragon film. I got what I wanted.Ed Speleers does a good job for his first film role. There are moments in there where you wish he'd done it a little better, but compared to the kid who plays Harry Potter, this guy is awesome.Jeremy Irons is THE perfect Brom. His portrayal of the character is a bit different from the book, but there are quite a few lines that the character says that are directly from the book, and he felt so right for the part. I was sad to see him die.Arya is also portrayed a little differently than in the book, being less of a butt hole to Eragon and being a little more flirty with him. However, it doesn't go to far with it.Durza ROCKED! He was so creepy. I was very impressed by that performance, as well as Galbatorix's.The special effects were also amazing. Saphira was awesome! And her as a baby...well...awwww. :) I loved the score to this film. The main theme was cool and I liked how they kept that same theme in every single track. Hopefully, if and when Eldest is made, they'll expand the score int o multiple sub-themes and...well...I enjoyed the score. :) I think the two major flaws that I noticed in the film were that it was way too short for it's on good. It felt more like an outline of Eragon rather than what it should've been. And the second flaw being some of the dialogue was a little wooden in parts. Especially with Eragon and Durza.Either way, this film was far better than the reviews were saying. Go there expecting a fun film, not an epic Lord of the Rings, and you'll enjoy it. And don't got there expecting a direct copy of Eragon the book. Think of it more of a new version of Eragon.","

"icehotfire","16 December 2006","I have many a problem with this movie. First of all, I read the book first and it was amazing, so i went into the theater with high expectations. I was almost immediately disappointed. The plot was extremely mangled, leaving out nearly half the book, swapping events, and giving important characters literally seconds on the screen (Angela the herbalist, Orik the dwarf). Secondly, the whole thing seemed rushed, and appeared to have taken place in about 1/16 of the time in the book, with Eragon making split second decisions for no apparent reason and then sprinting off. It would have been so much better had the director decided to lengthen the film to at least 2 hours. Sadly, also, it was watered down for the under-12 set (hence the PG rating) so it lost some of the gusto during the battles that were so fascinating in the book.","

"gsnowdon","17 December 2006","I am not going to argue about the merits of the book, I am sure most of the guys who criticize C. Paolini for his writing cannot write a decent novel at 19. I obviously can't, but I can read, and I love to read (don't we all?). I know that he got ideas from other books even those from three billy goats gruffs. I like the story, I actually read both books 1 and 2 at least twice. But I am really furious at how the movie and the script was made, people who did these should change their names because it IS awful! A 7 year old could've done better. Things I consider as downfall for the movie are: The Casting: there should be a careful consideration on the choosing. Arya for example was said as dark haired in the book and not blond. The Script: it is badly written and it made me wince every time they talk (or almost) it is so very corny. I usually like corny stuff but hell...this is the worst I've ever spent my 7.5 euros for! The blasted story was changed and opposites were shown! The urgals were made to look the tribal cannibals when they are supposed to be some version of a troll. And where were the dwarfs? Horst? the merchants...Special Effects: they've spent good money on the effects of the Dragon and I like the dragon but... nothing on the others... like the drawf kingdom under Beor Mountains, it should be in stones, marbles, a real gem instead of a primitive village with rice paddies!I'd like to see this story again as movie but... with better director, producer, script and budget - actors who played Eragon, Roran and Brom are fine as well as Saphira and her voice but the rest of the cast need changing or even play other roles. The girl who played Arya should fit as Serena. The story should end as it should like in the book..I think C. Paolini should roast the scriptwriter with the torn up script and fed to the scriptwriter's version of urgals.Thank you for reading.","

"kultiras","24 September 2012","If you have read the book(s), then this movie is a perfect example of how to ruin a perfect story (I have an other word in mind for ruin but that wouldn't be appropriate on IMDb). It doesn't come even close to the book. Of course its hard to film a good book, but at least give it a try. At some point I even thought I was watching a bad mad max version, and then almost at the end it looked like a bad version of Winnetou. The only thing that kept me watching was the dragon Saphira. But a dragon with feathered wings? OMG at least they could have done that right.Don't waste you time, read the books.","

"idproductions","16 December 2006","I feel so sorry for the author. The book was very enjoyable and I was very excited to see this movie. The movie took a great story and turned it into the biggest piece crap I have ever seen. It felt like it was directed by a high school student and the story did not follow the book at all. It was the biggest waste of my money in years and I should get my money back. What a load of crap. Edward Speleers is hot but a bad actor. Not right for the role. The story was predictable and nothing like the book. Galbatorix should not have been in the movie at all. It took away all of his characters mystery. The special effects where the only thing that kept me from giving this movie a big fat ZERO out of 10. Don't pay to see this movie. Buy the book. You will be glad you did. If you see this movie after reading the book you will see just how bad it really is.","

Not so. the acting is adequate, but the uter failure in the script, directorial lead, and perhaps most importantly book adaptation and editing makes this movie a truly awful experience. while i've read the two books in the series and had been looking forward to this film, i forgot i'd seen it later that same day, perhaps i'd blocked it out. irons, malkovitch and honsou should fire their agents. spellers, good luck in life, because after this movie, i'd be surprised if you were in a hallmark commercial.","

"rasinrice","16 December 2006","Please somebody out there (preferably a talented director), in 15 years or so, remake this movie. I beg of you!I read the book, loved it, and when I heard they were making a movie I could barely contain my excitement. Of course, I heard about the many critics comments, but I thought, 'even so, I am sure I will find it enjoyable.' Eragon is a story that could basically be summed up like this: Star Wars with dragons. Yeah, it's predictable, but hey. Characters: Eragon: He had his moments and I think with better direction he could have really soared. There were some scenes, where I thought maybe a bit too much eyeball narrowing, but hey, that's just me. Saphira: Little dragon Saphira is adorable, but who would have thought her growth spurt was going to be so quick? Eragon literary tossed her in the air and she morphed from toddler, to teen, to young adult in 1 minute flat. And here I ask, why in the heck did they do that!? A big part of Eragon and Saphira's relationship is him taking care of her from birth--the movie completely eliminated those important moments between the two. The rest of their ""building relationship"" was sitting around in the forest with Brom, and Saphira adding in her cheesy lines every once in awhile for what some people consider ""comedy"", I, on the other hand, was to busy laughing at Eragon's leather pants, but that is another story. Sloan: He's the butcher, you know the guy who refused to take Eragon's giant jelly bean, uh, I mean, stone. Anyways three words: They butchered him. yeah, okay, moving on.Roran: In the movie, he had fun wrestling with Eragon and trying to hit him with pots and pans. But then he leaves to go to war, which is completely inaccurate, and I am still failing to see the purpose of it. Garrow: The good old uncle to Eragon. He says a few wordsthan dies. Now get this, Eragon is supposed to find him under the rubble of the home, instead, Garrow lies under a few strategically placed sticks across his body in the living room. Brom walks in and sets him on fire. ""A burial fit for a king,"" he says impatiently, as pulls Eragon out of his grief. I think my mouth hit the floor. Brom: Brom is supposed to be the Gandalf/Dumbledore sort of character. He ends up being a poor chap, who is too wrapped in his own self woe for most of the movie, that he comes off rude and crotchety. Yeah, it's disappointing.Araya: This is the elf chick. She's unconscious for pretty much the entire first book, and she's arrogant, cold, and full of herself, like most elves are. So of course, it would only make sense to have her walking around in her little outfits getting all touchy with Eragon after they have spoken like3 sentences to each other.King Galbatorix: If you don't know already, this is supposed to be the big bad guy. We know this because he likes to glare off in the distance with his eyes narrowed, his arms crossed, and hot flames licking about him. Oh yeah. Unfortunately, the bald head reminds me too much of my uncle; suddenly he seems much less intimidating. Durza: The creepy magician dude, whose make-up changes half-way through the movie. Better than GalbatorixMurtagh: The most underdeveloped character in history! He sort of just jumps in going, HEY lets go find the Varden, YIPEE! So what if he really doesn't want to go there, and is supposed to be the kind of dark depressed guy. They COMPLETELY destroyed his character. Plot: The movie consists of riding on horses and going to Varden to make some fried urgals and stab Durza in the heart. No, but really, there are some major plot holes. If anything, my one complaint stands here. Eragon is a farm boy, not a warrior. During his travels with Brom he had to learn scores of ancient language in order to perform magic, and he fought daily with Brom in order to improve his sword fighting skills. Now, let's move on to the movies take on this. We see one fighting session. Then Eragon is able to perform all kinds of magic, even though he only knows three words. Fire, tree, and branch. Yup, you heard correctlybranch, of which he manages to kill a Ra'zac with. Summing it up: Overall, I felt the movie was riding too much on the cheesy side. There were moments, where I had to stuff my head in my sweater in order to contain my laughter. I think I was so disappointed, I could only laugh. The problem, and I say this with sincerity, is that it had so much potential. It was painful to watch such a great novel thrown into unable hands. From costuming to choreography, it was just short of nothing. Scenes moved choppily. Lines were stuck in, not for sense, but to move on. Characters were tossed in, but never properly developed. The soundtrack lacked emotional ties to the movie, and even the sound effects in many respects lost the punch that it needed. More often than not, I found myself questioning the direction of the scenes, the awkwardness of some of the slide transitions, and noting irritably that nothing really seemed to fit or run smoothly. I am sorry to say, that many of you novel readers will be thoroughly let down. It is sad to see such a great book crumble to pieces on the big screen.","

"Quicksand","16 December 2006","In 1997, I saw a film called ""Spawn,"" directed by Mark A.Z. Dippe'. The source material-- the comic, action figures, whatever-- were incredibly popular at the time, so I thought it odd that someone from the visual effects department, with no directing experience at all, would be chosen to direct a feature film. Though the special effects of the finished product were certainly striking for their time, the overall movie was beyond disappointing, and even with the fan excitement, ""Spawn"" tanked, there were no sequels, and the ""director"" never worked seriously again.In 2006, I saw a film called ""Eragon."" If you've looked up the director on the IMDb, you can see where I'm going with this. We've known the name of the director here for nearly a year, and over the months I managed to talk myself into it. ""It's a December release,"" I'd tell myself. ""Surely, Mr. Fangmeier must have shown something TRULY exceptional not only to get this job, but for his film to be good enough to be released at this time of year."" Turns out my initial reaction was the correct one: He can't direct, he was a poor choice for such a popular title, and has killed the series before it began. Well done, producers. You're not the first producers to shoot yourself in the foot, and you won't be the last.""Eragon"" isn't unwatchably bad, as it has a rather hefty novel to back it up. The visual effects are quite nice, and one or two FX sequences actually thrill. But I demand more from a 100-minute movie, and like most technicians or designers before him, Fangmeier shows absolutely no skill directing his actors, whatsoever. Jeremy Irons, professional that he is, bails out every scene he's in (and what a good sport, after that ""Dungeons and Dragons"" debacle), and Robert Carlyle is just sort of there. Malkovich less so, and Rachel Weisz even less so than that. All we're left with is pretty teenagers who will next be seen on Season 9 of ""Charmed."" I didn't know what to expect here, as both Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings have appealed to both kids and adults. ""Eragon"" will appeal solely to kids, or maybe teenage girls or gay men. There is more sexual chemistry-- I kid you not-- between Eragon and his dark-haired teenage rescuer, than there is in the chaste interaction between he and the dull redhead (who has multiple death scenes, but then shows up 5 minutes later, still hanging around).Movies like this are why movies with dragons never get made. Rent Willow, rent Harry Potter, read a D&D book or Anne McCaffrey or any number of things. This is just marketing with the most generic teenagers, score, and dialogue (""Let's finish this!"") I've ever heard. I worked in a bookstore when the book was released, and it appealed to all kinds, ages 5 to 85. The movie will make a few dollars this week, and then instantly vanish from your memory, until someone references it 9 years from now in an IMDb review, and you think to yourself, ""Wow, I remember that movie. That sure sucked.""","

I mean if you want people to be impressed by what you create don't let the writers hack it to pieces.

"BilSouter","24 December 2006","This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen, and anyone that has read the books will agree with me! If you have seen the movie I suggest you don't read the book because you will be so confused on what is happening. This movie skipped 3 whole city's and many, many main characters that were important to the story line. They also skipped many important events like Eragon's back getting slashed open by Durza and him hearing the cripple that is whole in his head. He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves. Also, did you hear of anyone called Orik or Hothgar in the movie? No? Didn't think so! Hothgar was the dwarf king and Orik was Eragons best friend in the book. Oh, and remember the cool ugly smoke monster that Durza was riding (and let me point out that Durza never used magic when fighting Eragon in the book or he would have died for sure) Oh yeah, back to the smoke monster, it was never in the book! Durza was fighting Eragon under the star sapphire (that they also didn't mention) and then Ayra broke it with magic because she was helping Saphira with her broken armor and THAT'S when Saphira first used fire. Eragon then used Zar'roc (who's gem should have been a ruby not a sapphire because Morzans dragon was red) to kill Durza. Then there is the Razac! There were only two in the book! The reason Brom should have died is because they were chasing the Razac because Eragon wanted revenge on them killing Garrow (his uncle). He also never learned sword fighting from Ro'ran and the movie never showed him fighting with Brom. Also, would it have killed them to put in Katrina, Ro'rans girlfriend that gets kidnapped in Eldest by the (((2))) Razac!!! Then they never went to Tierm were he really met Angela (the fortune teller) and The Werecat Solumbun who tells him important information that they need to use in the third book. They also never met Jeod in Tierm who they need to help them find the Razac that they were chasing not running away from them.","

"keithsealy","15 December 2006","I knew nothing about this book, but am a fantasy reader and movie fan. This movie was a real disappointment, about on with the fantasy miniseries that often show on the Sci-fi channel. Here are my general comments: The CGI was sub-standard. The dragon often looked painted in and the special effects were generally poor. For example, the dragon didn't cast a shadow in one scene. We saw better 10 years ago in Dragonheart.The writing and editing were poor. Some sections of the movie could have been completely removed, including a long section at the beginning involving character we never see again. But, later, the story feels very rushed and there is no time for character or story development.The acting was pretty meager. Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich were clearly just going through the motions. The only bright spot was Robert Carlyle, who's villain was truly threatening.Wait until this one hits DVD, or better yet, cable. Within two years it will be one of those fantasy movies the Sci-fi channel shows on Sunday afternoons.","

"chrisrobbins-2","15 December 2006","And yes, I have read the book. I just got back from seeing Eragon, and I am not at all disappointed. This can catch the eyes from far and from close. The acting I thought was very catchy and extremely good. Do not listen to the negative critics at all, because they must have been high when they saw this movie. And if you are one of them, get laid you losers. This was definitely one of the best movies of the year ( besides Pirates Of The Caribbean, Superman, and Casino Royale ).Acting: Edward Speleers is the new generation of acting. His acting was simply incredible for his first movie which is based on an very popular novel. None should have to ask about Jeremy Irons. His role as Brom was amazing and fit the description. And of course the beautiful and young Sienna Guillory was the best way of describing Arya. She was young, beautiful, a great fighter and an amazing actress. 8/10 CGI: Very convincing. Saphira looked extremely real and very clever. The magic was the way of the century. I loved it. Arya's and Eragon's dreams were very intriguing. And the fight towards the end was spectacular. 9/10Attention Parents: I know that you may have young ones who have either read the book, or seen the previews, but lets be reasonable here. This should not be rated PG. It had extremely frighting moments that could really scare little ones. Durza looks like he was the Devil himself. The king is a merciless killer with a voice that could haunt children's dreams for a time to come. I personally think it should be rated PG-13 For: Intense Fantasy Violence some graphic images and some Frighting and Scary Moments.Overall: Not exactly a movie for the whole family, yet for those who can withstand it, you will not be disappointed in the least. The acting was splendid, CGI was very convincing and it had a lot of depth involved into the story. 8/10 Also Read The Book If You Haven't Already!","

"TheLittleSongbird","4 April 2010","First things first, I have yet to read the book, but my brother absolutely loves it and says it is so worth the read. While the film could have been much better, there are redeeming qualities. Also, I do not think it is the worst fantasy film ever, that dishonour belongs to Dungeons & Dragons.Starting with the redeeming qualities, the film is very assured visually and technically. The sets are wondrous and the costumes are very nice. Plus the cinematography was excellent, as was the sweeping score. The acting is uneven, but there were some good performances. Jeremy Irons, a great actor, does a good job as Brom acquiring a dry sense of humour, much better than he was in Dungeons & Dragons, somehow his overacting in that film managed to further bring it down. Also John Malkovich chews the scenery with glee as the tyrannical King Galbatorix, and Robert Carlyle is decent as Durza. The best thing though was the dragon Sapphira, very well designed with expressive voice work from Rachel Weisz, and the flying scenes and the CGI effects are a delight.However, there are many things wrong with Eragon. One is that the film is too short, consequently the characters feel thinly sketched. This could be a reason why the relationship between Eragon and Sapphira came across as unconvincing. The story was a great idea, but due to the running time primarily it meanders all over the place and is unevenly paced(sometimes feeling rushed and sometimes it drags). Ed Speleers is rather bland as Eragon, handsome yes but bland. It is pretty much the same for Sienna Guillory, gorgeous but unconvincing. The actors though are burdened by a very hammy and lacklustre script that could've done with more intelligence and wit and there are parts where the direction is flawed.Overall, not unbearably awful but I don't necessarily recommend it. 5/10 Bethany Cox","

"sashi_han","15 December 2006","Honest to God, I tried not to hate this movie. I would have walked out if I hadn't been babysitting. I read this book last year and I was so incredibly excited when the movie was coming out, so when I was babysitting this afternoon I decided to take the kids to this movie. After about half and hour I wanted to run out and watch The Pursuit of Happynes or get hit by a truck, whatever was closer, but maybe that was just because I read the book and it messed it up too bad for comfort. A plus was that small children find it quite entertaining, and I must admit, I found it very entertaining to hear them chat about it on the way home in the car. Other than that, I think it was a story that was poorly executed. I think you everyone should read the book and wait for the DVD.","

It goes way way too fast and it doesn't go by the book at all. If they ever make the sequel to it (Eldest) I don't want to see it. They left the ending Eragon all screwy meaning that they couldn't do a thing for Eldest and probably make it even worse then Eragon. I guess if you don't compare it to the book it's an OK movie but it still sucks and I don't even wanna recommend watching it. Yes, it was that bad.

"TheMovieDoctorful","12 November 2018","The Eragon books have aged like a bowl of cottage cheese sitting in the Gobi Desert for 18 months. While I hailed the books as brilliant, well written masterpieces in my youth, adulthood has made me a lot more aware of their blatant problems with characterization, dialogue, prose, character development, romance, sexism and plagiarism. While my awareness to the awfulness of the books is fairly recent, I knew Eragon was a bad movie from the first time I saw it as a 9 year old in theaters. In fact, Eragon holds the distinction of being the first movie I ever recognized as being bad. So it goes without saying that, as awful as the books are, the movie somehow manages to be even worse. How is that even possible?If you really want me to nitpick, there are a couple things I enjoy here. Jeremy Irons is outstanding as Brom, the former Dragon Rider turned village-storyteller who trains Eragon in the ways of his ancient order. He showcases some incredible range here, from the exhaustion and hopelessness caused by the decades past extinction of his entire religion to the enthusiasm, pride and excited hopefulness he gives upon seeing Eragon's skills thrive as a Dragon Rider. You can really tell watching him that he takes his role seriously and is desperately trying to raise the professionalism and credibility of this otherwise-miserable failure. He gives as much depth as possible to a role really devoid of any. Minus Irons, the film can also be unintentionally hilarious at times.Also, I do have to point out that I absolutely love the credits song Holding On by Avril Lavigne. It fits the movie this is at least trying to be and I just generally love all things Avril. I don't know, maybe I'm just a 2000s Instagram teenage girl at heart.John Malkovich gets very little screentime, but plays the role of King Galbatorix like the villain of a Highlander sequel. The film becomes 10x more enjoyable whenever he's on scream. Robert Carlyle is a laugh riot as well as the Shade Durza. There's literally a scene where, for no particular reason at all, he full on hisses to show the audience how evil he is (A scene that's admittedly taken straight from the atrocious book it's based on.) You may think from my description that these performances were intentional camp, but I assure you. I sat through this thing and it's entirely aiming to be taken seriously as High Fantasy. Just try listening to it's hilariously bombastic, over-the-top, overblown and pompous musical score. The sheer ambition of the film, the idea that this crew of clowns thought this was the film that was gonna take down Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter is hilarious beyond words.Edward Speelers isn't a ""bad actor"" persay, but my God is he a boring one here. He brings nothing to the role of Eragon, which is a big problem when the character is already weakly characterized and thinly written. He doesn't have the enthusiastic optimism of Mark Hamill's Luke, the rougeish charm of Justin Whalin's Ridley, the boyish innocence of Elijah Wood's Frodo or the tortured angst of Hayden Christensen's Anakin. The performance and the character offer nothing to grip or invest us, nothing of substance. It's the same ""farm boy discovers he's the Chosen One"" cliche we've seen a million times before. At least the movie ignored the book's characterization of Eragon being a creepy, possessive, ""nice guy"" incel to Arya (Can you tell it was written by a 15 year old boy?)Speaking of Arya, my God, what a shallow, poorly written throwaway character. In both the book and the movie, she's a ""strong, empowered character"" in the most 2006 way possible. She's highly intelligent, when she's not getting herself captured. She's a badass who can take care of herself, despite spending more than half the movie being tortured and needing a man to save her. She's a strong and authoritative leader, despite having her authority usurped by like 3 other characters.The system of magic and spell casting was one of the only interesting, unique and imaginative ideas in the entire Eragon mythos. And, somehow, the movie even manages to screw that up. Rather than a mysterious, wild, almost living entity of nature of the book that sought to destroy those who attempted to use it and weren't worthy, magic in the Eragon movie is merely an extreme power that needs extra restraint to be controlled. Do you understand what I mean now when I say the movie is worse?The characterization is all over the place in this film. Characters will get introduced left and right, built up with important positions and backstories and never developed or expanded upon at all. There's talk of Dwarven kings and Rebel leaders and children of traitors, but no actual characters to be seen here. They're only included to have bigger roles in the (hypothetical) sequels, but if there's nothing in Eragon to justify its existence as its own story, why would we want to come back for more?The production value is absolutely embarrassing considering the massive budget and the film's ambitions for a franchise. The cinematography is lazy and lifeless, the sets are overstuffed and lack personality, the costume and weapon design look like cheap Game of Thrones cosplay, the CGI is cartoonish and uninventive, the creature FX makeup is unimaginative and boring. This is an ugly, ugly world. Isn't the point of high fantasy to transport us to a world more wondrous and spectacular than our own? Eragon's production values and aesthetics feel straight out of a CW show.Eragon represents the worst of fantasy fiction. It has no identity, no substance and no soul beyond copying what both Paolini and the filmmakers thought were ""cool"" aspects of Lord of the Rings. And it was written by the same idiot who did Jurassic Park III. Why am I not surprised?","

"aldemaever","16 December 2006","Myself, my brother and a friend of mine went to see the debut of 'Eragon.' The sad part about it, was that I only lasted through about 30 minutes of the movie, before we walked out and demanded our money back. Before the movie was even released, I had thought Peter Jackson would've been a better fit to make the movie. My brother had told me that Christopher Paolini wanted to have a lesser known company produce his movie,and that I should give it a chance... It was a bad idea, and I'll tell you why: 1) In the book, when Saphira bonded with Eragon, and gave him the Gedwëy Ignasia, or 'shining palm' it says nothing about Brom, Arya, and Galbatorix sensing it at the same moment it happens. Nor does it say anything about Arya telling Durza that the egg has already hatched, as it does in the movie.2) In the book, it takes Saphira a good amount of time to grow into a larger dragon and to develop communication skills. It didn't happen on her first flight into the air, like the movie portrays. The ability for Eragon and Saphira to communicate was slowly established, not automatic.3) The Urgals in the movie looked like war-painted employees of the WWE. The book perceives them as having bowed legs, thick brutish arms made for crushing, very large ram-like horns with yellow, piggish eyes and grayish skin. There's nothing in the movie (from what I had seen) that resembled the Urgal description. If they were Urgals, then I should the Kull to look like the gray Incredible Hulk?4) The first time Eragon used the magic term 'brisngr,' he was in an alley in a village that had been ravaged by Urgals. In the movie, they're on a bridge in Daret, and his arrow not only kills some Urgals, but it destroys the bridge as well. That scene was ridiculous. It's like Starsky and Hutch crashing through cardboard boxes in a warehouse. It was too played out.5) Why was Brom so eager to bring Eragon to the Varden in the movie? In the book, the reason Eragon and Brom left Carvahall in the first place was to track down and kill the Ra'zac. Brom was reluctant to bring Eragon to the Varden the entire journey. Only when their opportunities for survival had depleted, did they know that the Varden was the only place they could go.6) In the book, Roran leaves Carvahall to work as a miller's assistant in Therinsford. When he comes back, the Ra'zac and Imperial soldiers come looking for him. In the movie, Roran leaves because he is of age (18) and doesn't want to be recruited. He says to Eragon before he leaves that he doesn't know where he is going.7) In the book, Brom is wise, knowledgeable story teller, but in the movie, he's a cowardly drunk guy who speaks of dragons & riders and gets looked at like he's speaking about UFOs and belongs in the madhouse. Also, if Eragon, Brom, Durza and Galbatorix are from Alagaesia, why is Galbatorix the only one without an English accent (he has an American accent)? 8) It's rumored that they spent A LOT of money making this movie. Honestly, I'm not sure on what. Possibly on Saphira. Oh, and just by watching the movie, it's never said how she obtains her name. And where does feathers on a dragon come in? Is it a birdon, or a dragird? No. It states in the book that Saphira's wings are made of a 'thin membrane.' In one scene, of the movie, Eragon snaps at Brom saying ""I'll never ride her again!"" In the book, he is so severely cut and bleeding from her scales rubbing against his legs, that he passes out for a couple of days. That's why he said he'd never ride her again. Of course, you wouldn't know that from the movie.9) Durza looked like Paul Reubens (Pee-Wee Herman for those who have forgotten), and reminded me more of a pedophile than a villain. Why was John Malkovich playing King Galbatorix? I could've sworn I was watching John Lithgow in a leotard. John Malkovich seemed like he was overacting to me. Why wasn't Solembum the werecat, Orik, or the Twins in the movie? They existed in the book... Oh, wait. That's right. From the way the movie portrayed things, probably 50 of the 544 pages were used to write this seedy plot, and later, filmed disappointment.The bottom line is that it felt like chapters were skipped, and key events were missed or altered for something far less appealing then what was in the book. I wish I could've had the 30 minutes back I spent watching this bleeding Picasso. I actually enjoyed the 5 minute trailer of Eddie Murphy's ""Norbit"" more than I enjoyed watching Eragon. The books are incredible, and I couldn't put down Eragon or Eldest. The movie on the other hand, I don't think I can finish watching it.Not So Safe Bet: See the movie... Safe Bet: See the movie, then read the book... Safest Bet: Read the book, and don't watch the movie.","

"paulfriday","3 April 2009","Before seeing this movie I checked out a few reviews and was told not to expect anything. I figured if I set the bar low enough, maybe, just maybe I'd enjoy it as an adaptation of a decent fantasy novel. Well, the bar was set pretty low but nothing could have prepared me for the cheesiness of this. Ed Speleers (Earagon) reminded me of a really bad version of Hayden Christensen in Star Wars 2 , but with even cheesier lines and unconvincing emotions. The story carried on too quickly to explain much (yet I was constantly checking my watch), the director took a little too much liberty with the storyline compared to the book, and the music was too epic and heavy-handed. There were a few too many ill-timed dreamy scenes of sunsets, reunions and other pseudo-emotional things, and as a final insult, the first song in the credits was from Avril Lavigne. Suddenly it was all too clear who the target audience was - pre-teens who wouldn't know a bad movie if it ripped out their braces. Thinking back, a few of the characters did look pretty Emo - a little too much eye shadow perhaps. As for redeeming qualities, these were few and far between. The scenery was nice, which allowed for some breathtaking travel and flying scenes. Unfortunately I couldn't think of a single performance that I liked - even the dragon's. While Sean Connery redeemed 'Dragonheart' with his noble voice as the dragon, Rachel Weisz was not given very good lines with which to work her magic. The only character I didn't mind was Arya, and only because she was easy on the eyes. However, she did a poor job of convincing me that she was a tough elf with a soft spot for Eragon.I think the final nail in the coffin for this movie is that Lord of the Rings was just too good. It set the bar too high for this cheap dragon flick. Other movies that followed LOTR (eg the Witch, the Lion and the Wardrobe) did a decent job in trying to carry on the fantasy genre, but unfortunately this movie seemed to take it a step back.Even if you liked the book, I suggest you skip this movie altogether - it might ruin your perception of Earagon, at least until you forget about the film, that is. ...I surely will.","

"phq_bethel_19","17 December 2006","If you have read the book I recommend that this is the last movie you see. And those who have read the book and seen the movie, you will know just how crappy this movie is. This movie picked and chose what it added. Key characters for Eldest (second book) are removed, cities Eragon and Brom visit are removed and things that don't even happen are put into it.I saw this with a family member who lent me the book to read and I was expecting something big like LOTR, for I had seen the previews and thought it would be really good. It was the second day it was screening in Australia and there were at least 20 people in the cinema...I found that the opening sequence was alright. But as it got into the telling of the story, it started to get suck-y-er.The story moved so fast that unless you have read the books, you wouldn't know how fast it did. One day Eragon finds an egg, next he's being told to fly and being pushed southwards. No storyline or plot (as far as I can tell) at all!","

"amyjae-1","15 December 2006","OK, so no Academy nominations forthcoming, but all in all, I think this movie was worth our admission and pricey popcorn. Some of the dialog was a bit stilted and hammy, but the characters were easy to care about and/or easy to loathe, as whichever the case required. There were four of us attending, ages 9 (daughter), 11 (son), 22 (my hubby) and 35 (me, the wife)... We all enjoyed it for different reasons. No, we weren't totally blown away (well, my daughter thought it was fabulous, and wants a dragon), but no one was disappointed either. Of course, none of us have read the book, so we were simply judging what we had seen for ourselves, and we had no preconceived notions about what it should be.But, the special effects were pretty cool to watch, the scenery was beautiful, costuming was pretty cool and the fight scenes were exciting to watch (and my husband & I liked that Friesian that Irons rode). When all was said and done, we had each been sufficiently entertained. A fun afternoon with the family, everyone cheering on Eragon and his dragon. An enjoyable, though not overwhelming movie.","

"morgalblade","16 December 2006","I saw this movie today, opening day, and I was almost instantly disappointed. The character development is horrible and it appeared that the writers did not read the book in detail or just decided to write to appease 4- 9 year olds. There are so many things wrong about this movie, I would exceed the 1000 word limit for this review. Also, many major events were removed and some were crushed together with others( Angela's part, which happened in Yazuac in the movie, was in Tierm in the book, which was completely cut out).I will now begin to list out the major mistakes and cutouts.Spoilers ahead, BEWARE!1. The farm was not destroyed in the movie, it was in the book. 2. There were no soldiers in Carvahall, forcing people to fight. 3. Katrina was not even mentioned or shown and this is going to make it hard in the next film to explain. 4. Galbatorix has not had any lines in the books to date and does not learn of Eragon until later in the book, whereas in the movie, it is discovered almost instantly. 5. At almost all points in the movie, they are surrounded by mountains, whereas in the book, they travel across open plains frequently. 6. The 'shining palm' is not portrayed as a lump of silver skin, as it is in the book. 7. There is no rant from Shaphira in the beginning of the book about ""Oath breakers, murderers!"" and so on. Her flight with Eragon into the mountains is not shown, thus making little sense how the Ra'zac could have gotten to the farm faster than Shaphira to non reader moviegoers. 8. Galbatorix is portrayed as a warlord, not a king. He lives in the largest city of men, Uru- Baen, but is shown as a huge fortress, no city. 9.Brom is NOT killed by Durza, but from taking a knife thrown by the Ra'zac for Eragon. 10. Dras- Leona is not included, and is important because shows were the dreaded beasts are from. 11. The whole hunt for where the Ra'zac's oil came from is not included. 12. Murtagh was never following Brom and Eragon. 13. The elves are not portrayed as Paolini's elves- stronger than humans, fairer, and more knowledgeable in magic, and also, where the heck were the elven ears! 14. The dwarfs hardly shown and the ones who were shown were as tall as the humans. This is Ovious when Hrothgar and Ajiad(forgot how to spell it) are standing next to each other. 15. Farthen- Dur is not portrayed as being inside a mountain, there was no crystal also. 16. What the heck was up with the fight with Eragon and Durza!!. Durza did not have a flying beast, Eragon received no back scar, and there was no sword fighting at all!! 17. There was no portrayal of the flight across the desert and Ayra was knocked out during the flight. 18. Some of the important side characters were not included. Orik and the twins are on this list. 19. None of Eragon's accidents are included in the movie.The list is by no means complete and could go on forever. I did not think it was possible to butcher a book so badly until I saw this. Those producers ripped the book to shreds and made a complete mockery of Paolini's works. I personally feel sorry for the following people: Christopher Paolini(How could you let them do this to your works!!!) Any fan of the book who went to see the movie(You WILL want the hour and a half of your life back) Irons and Malkovich (How could you let them make you look so bad!)( Congrats to Irons, you acted well, but for a lost cause)If you liked the book as I did, you will not like the movie, as I did. No fan of the book in their right mind would like this movie. Please don't waste your time with this movie, please.","

"SnoopyStyle","28 October 2013","Eragon (Ed Speleers) is a simple farm boy who finds a dragon egg. When it hatch, he become a dragon rider. He is mentored by former dragon rider Brom (Jeremy Irons). He with his dragon Saphira (Rachel Weisz) must battle the tyrant Galbatorix (John Malkovich) and the dragon riding magician Durza (Robert Carlyle).The biggest problem is the lead Ed Speleers. He lacks any charisma to drive this movie. His style of acting can only be described as deer-in-headlights. His bland face actually becomes annoying. Jeremy Irons is wasted in this flat mess. He has no one to reciprocate with. He has better luck with the dragon.The other problem is utter lack of originality in the story. After spending much of intro explaining the world, it's still a uncompelling mess. I didn't care about this world. And I didn't care about the people in it.The CG and the visual are all up to date. The big battles and dragons look relatively good. The cast with the exception of Speleers are all top notch. The sad part is all of them are wasted.","

The only thing gained from this film was the knowledge that Rachel Weiz should NEVER voice act again. They should of just made the dragon Sean Connery, i know it would screw up the whole ""storyline"" of the book, but you know the director seemed to take care of that himself.The story just sorta skipped, and any character that was developed was hated, and the rest that weren't you still hated.

"poolandrews","6 July 2010","Eragon is set in the land of Alagesia where the evil Galbotorix (John Malkovich) has killed all of the Dragon protectors & their riders, Galbotorix has then declared himself King of Alagesia. One night Princess Arya (Sienna Guillory) steals the last remaining Dragon egg from Galbotorix's castle & manages to magically transport to another part of the Kingdom before she is captured. A young farm boy named Eragon (Ed Speleers) finds the egg & once it hatches is shocked to discover that he is now that Dragon's rider, meanwhile Galbotorix's evil sorcerer Durza the Shade (Robert Carlyle) sends the Goblin like Razac creatures to find & kill Eragon before he & his Dragon can reach & inspire the Varden rebels who oppose Galbotorix & will fight against him to wage war on Galbotorix & his evil army of Razac's...This American, British & Hungarian co-production was directed by Stefan Fangmeier & was based on the novel by Christopher Paolini & was an obvious attempt to ride on the success of another huge fantasy film based on literature The Lord of the Rings & to be blunt Eragon feels just like a bland The Lord of the Rings copy. I have never read Paolini's novel but apparently this film guts it by removing dozens of subplots, characters & events. The whole film feels like a second rate rip-off of fantasy novel themes, from a lush land populated by simple folk who are terrorised by a dark lord or king, Elves, Goblin like monsters, big epic battles with swords & bow & arrows, typical fire breathing Dragon's that fly, character's have silly names that you can't remember, there's a Princess in danger & of course a simple hero who has to undergo both a literal & personal journey as he has to master great power & learn to listen to people who tell him to be wise. Eragon is so generic & bland & forgettable that it felt like the makers just sat down & said how can we make another The Lord of the Rings & make lots of money? The makers try to copy just about everything, from the vast shots of the character's travelling across the landscape on horseback to the way the monsters look to the lighting to the costumes to the language to the epic battle at the end where the heroes are hopelessly outnumbered. The plot is very thin, there's no background on how Galbotorix became King other than a brief narrated introduction, th character's are poor with Eragon's journey far too swift, before you know it Eragon has gone from a simple farm boy to the leader of a rebellion who is also a master swordsman & can fly a Dragon. The one aspect of Eragon that is different from The Lord of the Rings is the Dragon, even though one could say the idea is taken from Dragonheart (1996) which was a much better film anyway, instead of a talking Dragon like in Dragonheart here Eragon & his Dragon communicate telepathically which just didn't seem right to me.Even the action scenes are disappointing, the final fight never really gets going & is all but over before it starts & to get a kiddie friendly PG rating there's no real violence or edge to them. The CGI computer effects are alright if not amazing, the makers have given the Dragon a very human face with very human like feature which i thought looked daft. While I am sure the makers thought a human face would be more expressive I want my Dragon's to look like Dragon's you know? To be fair the effects here are no better than those seen in Dragonheart which was made some ten years earlier. At one hour & forty odd minutes the pace is alright but not that much actually happens & it's very predictable simple hero rises to stand against & defeat evil King, I can emphasise who generic & routine Eragon is despite it's huge budget & the talent involved.With a supposed budget of about $100,000,000 a lot was spent on Eragon & it underperformed at the box-office which hopefully means we will be spared a sequel. Mainly filmed in Hungary. The acting is poor, Ed Speleers in particular makes for a very bland hero while Jeremy Irons has the good sense not to stick around until the end. John Malkovich gets about two minutes of screen time & Robert Carlyle looks silly with cracked lips & red eyes as he tries to be intimidating.Eragon is basically a mixture of Dragonheart & The Lord of the Rings & is nowhere near as good as either of them, the Dragon looks too human, the leads are too bland, the action & set-pieces are forgettable & the entire thing feels like one long rip-off trying to ride on the success of another film rather than create it's own.","

Brom does not teach eragon with the little stone... Rohan just ""goes away"" for no reason. Where is his girlfriend? The twins are not included in the film, the dwarf does not rescue Eragon.Eragon does not see Arya by the dream-view accidentally, but Durza calls for eragon in the film. They do not cross the dessert and there are no more than 10 short sentences between Murthag and Eragon. Eragon is not hurt from Durzas sword, he doesn't seem to have any harm at all.The story is totally ununderstandable.......Conclusion: EVERYTHING IS MESSED UP! The Film is like a unlovely mixed best of from the book. It changed all the nice details and nothing is left from the flair of Paulini.","

"jboothmillard","10 April 2010","When I saw the trailer for this film at the cinema, I thought it looked like a rubbish rip-off of The Lord of the Rings, and while the analogy wasn't true, the quality of the film was. Basically Alagaesia is the kingdom ruled by the villain and former dragon rider who betrayed those close to him in his quest for power, King Galbatorix (A very underused John Malkovich). Orphan farm boy Eragon (Ed Speleers) is sent a blue stone by Princess Arya (Sienna Guillory), which he realises is a dragon egg, and out hatches Saphira (Rachel Weisz). She grows into a high flying friend that feels what Eragon feels, which comes in handy for directions and stuff, and soon Eragon meets another former dragon rider and mentor in Brom (Jeremy Irons). They realise that Alagaesia is in trouble, so he joins forces with the good guys in their gang, the race of warriors known as the Varden. They all go into the battle against Galbatorix, evil sorcerer Durza (Robert Carlyle) and the army of weird looking men in the quest for freedom. Also starring Blood Diamond's Djimon Hounsou as Ajihad, Garrett Hedlund as Murtagh, Joss Stone as Angela, Alun Armstrong as Uncle Garrow and Christopher Egan as Roran. The special effects don't add anything, the performances (apart from maybe Irons) are all lame and ineffective, that includes the dragon too, and the action is not interesting enough viewing, an easily forgettable fantasy adventure. Pretty poor!","

"BarkleyVader","24 December 2006","The Eragon book was okay considering the fact it was written by a teenager. But when I read it I noticed it had some contradictions, some things that you could tell were from the fantasy of a lonely teenager (for example, Arya was a vegetarian, yet she wore tight leather to seduce people, was ""beautiful"", and also discriminated against the dwarfs based on religion, etc, etc you could almost tell she was the brain-spawn of a single teenager who wished for such a fantasy) and its plot was identical to that of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. I expected that Hollywood would fix these problems, yet I noticed that only the Arya-snoot problem was fixed. The acting was bad, and the plot was equal to that of the book: Mediocre.No, the acting was horrible and the plot stunk. I don't think it was the actors' fault, but rather the script and the book it was based on. They obviously had a hard time with it, you could tell. The Special Effects were good, and the dragon was indeed the best character, which isn't saying much.So basically, a plot summary of both Eragon and Star Wars: ""A farm boy *Luke Skywalker/Eragon* raised by his uncle *Uncle Owen/Garrow* finds a mysterious artifact *Droids/Dragon Egg* that changes his life. His uncle is killed by the enemy's henchmen *Stormtroopers/Ra'Zac*. He is then put under the training of a wise old hermit *Obi-Wan Kenobi/Brom* (who is secretly part of the order that the farm boy is training to resurrect *Jedi Order/Dragon Riders*) who teaches him how to use a magical force *The Force/Magic*. They travel to the base of the rebels *Yavin IV/Farthen Dur* opposing an evil empire ruled by an evil tyrant *Palpatine/Galbatorix* who seeks to destroy the rebellion *Rebel Alliance/Varden* and the new threat, but along the way the mentor is killed by an elite member of the enemy forces *Darth Vader/Durza*. He continues his journey with a beautiful woman *Princess Leia/Arya* and a rogue *Han Solo/Murtagh* with a secret past. The entire thing eventually climaxes into a battle for the safety of the rebellion *Battle Against the Death Star/Battle of Farthen-Dur* and the rebels win, taking with them one of the king's sidekicks *Grand Moff Tarkin/Durza*. A new hope rises for the rebellion as they challenge the empire!"" Only die-hard fans will find the movie appeasing, and only little children who have never seen the original star wars trilogy will find it original. The one thing I didn't see in the movie was a Wookiee, which was a shame.So really, make it your choice if you want to see a poorly slapped together piece of work combining Lord of the Rings with Star Wars, with horrible acting (at no fault of the actors).I don't blame the cast and crew for making this movie stink, but the original book which is obviously a Lord-Of-The-Rings Fan's version of Star Wars.One last thing: Galbatorix's name sounds like a shampoo bottle.","

"arabianardour","15 December 2006","I went to Eragon not expecting a whole lot, and was quite pleasantly surprised. I am actually shocked to see how many people are giving it bad reviews. Sure, I haven't read the book like a lot of people have, but if you take the movie for itself, it is passingly well-done. Just don't go in expecting a LOTR and you should find the movie very enjoyable. The special effects are for the most part superb, including the dragon, Saphira, who looked a lot more realistic than I expected. Ed Speelers does a very commendable job, for his debut movie performance. He comes across as a fresh-faced, somewhat naive, but sincere and believable Eragon.I don't know about the book, but this isn't a movie with a deep storyline, or important moral. It's a fun, fantasy film with plenty of thrills, a few funny or touching moments and stunning cinematography. But, that being said, it didn't feel empty. I left the theater feeling very satisfied and more than ready to see a sequel. I really hate to see people giving it such a bad rap. It gets 9 out of 10 stars from me. The one star off being for some clumsiness in the plotting/script and some of the disturbingly ugly evil creatures (I don't recall the name), which I think could have been downplayed more for a PG movie.Overall, Eragon is a highly enjoyable experience. I hope more people start to see it as such.","

"jashar","15 December 2006","The plot was far too rushed. They didn't spend any time developing the characters or explaining anything. Movies are rarely as good as books, but if I hadn't read the book I would have found this movie hard to follow. Durza was by far the best part. He was impressive and imposing. The Urgals were more like retarded barbarians than they should have been. Eragon was a bit wimpy too. The movie never showed how his skill progressed, or how he practiced. This really should have been at least a 2 and a half hour movie not the hour and half they made. I hope someone in the future gives this story another try and see if they can make the movie right this time.","

"littlemomma07","15 October 2008","I give this movie a 3 due to the actors: Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich and Rachel Weisz and special effects. I have to agree with the many comments out there that are negative about this movie. I am very glad I never wasted my money and just waited to borrow it from the library. The movie seems like the screenwriter ate the book then just took the pieces that were not digested and used them (sorry for the grotesque way of looking at it.) The book was so much better! What I can't believe is that Paolini actually let them tear his work up like that. I am an aspiring writer trying to get to a point where I can be published one day and this movie sucked compared to the book. I think I missed the part in the book that described elf ears as being normal looking... oh wait it didn't say that. Anyway, they do leave out characters that should have been in there, they way they did cities isn't at all like it was described in the books, and yes it seems it is centered around Eragon and Brom. There is so much I could say against this movie it would take me hours to type. Yes, all movies leave things out or change things, but this book was hacked up bad enough that now it is just sad (the movie not the book) Please someone out there take this book, read it and make a longer better movie out of it keep Irons, Malkovich and Weisz, and get other actors for the other characters. And please whatever you do Peter Buchman and Stefen Fangmeier PLEASE DON'T try to make a second one. Sad Sad Sad.... There is a reason the DVD I borrowed has the sticker ""Children"" on it. If you want to see a great movie/movies watch Lord of the Rings at least they don't hack the books up too badly as this one was.","

What I understand about so many 1/10 marks is that it is only given by people who knew the books before. But a screenplay is so hard to make from a book, especially when the book is excellent. Anyway, the movie is great from a completely neutral point of view, the special effects are excellent, the acting is very good and it just gives you the passion for dragons and this epic!Magical!

"matthew-schon-morgan","7 September 2017","Tell me if you've heard this one before... A farm boy wants to do something more with his life. He leaves home to run an errand, finds something that foreshadows a future as a special kind of knight, and when he returns home is a family is dead. He and a mentor go to rescue a princess. The mentor teaches him about how to tap into a special ability he has. They quickly run into a shady guy who will end up proving himself trustworthy. They fly around. They get to the princes and release her. The mentor takes on the big bad guy and dies. The three young heroes unite and blow up the evil lair. The name of the movie I'm describing is.... Eragon? True, Star Wars itself is in many ways just a retelling of The Hidden Fortress, but that was a practically unknown movie, especially when you compare it to Star Wars.","

Scenes are a little ill fitted and the plot flaws have not been ironed out anywhere as much as they should have been.Yet, for all its flaws and shortcomings, Eragon has something to it. It's uplifting and the main character's innocence, coupled with a world of fantasy and great scenery makes up for whatever the scripts lack in finesse. There is a sense of adventure and a desire to tell the story. And the story is good.Oh, and did I mention Sienna Guillory looks absolutely amazing? ;-)","

"Tommiegirlxxx","29 January 2011","OK, here's the thing, the book? AMAZING! Great plot, writing, character development, etc. But this movie was just...SO bad.... my liking of the book was actually brought down a couple notches. The redeeming qualities of this feature are the special effects, Jerome Irons, and John Malkovich. But Irons dies without as much elaboration as one would've hoped on his character because he's only in for, like, 30 minutes. And, though they keep showing small scenes of Malkovich, all in all, he's got about 10 minutes worth of screen time. Finally, why sacrifice good writing for special effects? Yes, they're important, but when the rest of the movie flows, the special effects are less important to engrossing one's audience into their project. This movie had a lot of potential, but it was ruined, and the story wasn't even followed through enough to relate to the book it was based off of. I swear, after watching this, all I thought was, ""I hope this wasn't ACTUALLY Christopher Paloni's vision of the movie version of the book he's put so much time and thought into.""","

DO NOT see the movie.Although I may sound a little harsh, they unfortunately shortened the whole tale into a brief outline. Certain characters; that were to my opinion very very important, didn't even make appearances throughout the whole movie. Overall, I found it a disappointment to all true Paolini fans.

"dieselhead89","5 September 2011","I originally viewed this movie with no prior history in the series, and I absolutely LOVED it. It was adventurous, exciting, and it had this way of sorta dragging you into a new world. Then, my interest being piqued, I read the book. I was astounded at the horrible quality of movie-making the film adaptation displayed. By comparison, the movie is atrocious. It's poorly written, poorly acted (mostly), and the storyline is so withdrawn from the book I'm surprised they kept the same title. The actors did a good job for what they were given to work with, I'll give them that, but the inaccuracies are too numerous to mention here. The big ones, I can't help but mention though. Why in the wide world of Hollywood did they give Saphira feathers?! It is very clearly pointed out in the book on numerous occasions that Saphira's wings are thin membranes of skin, NOT feathers, and this does play into the story in places. Were the powers-that-be trying to make a reference to evolution (which I, personally, find highly offensive), or were they just smoking something illegal? And Saphira's growth from hatchling to adult was so exaggerated with no sense of time or character growth, just kind of a *poof* ""There you go!""...completely un-satisfying. Next, the characters of Brom and Arya were nothing like the book described them, taking nothing away from Jeremy and Sienna's performances; but in all fairness, at least they were actually in the movie. Main character's such as: Hrothgar, Orik, Jormunder, the citizens of Carvahall, and numerous others that had vital roles to play as sub-characters were not even featured or named. On the other hand, Galbatorix was never even featured in the first book, and yet he has a full, speaking role in the movie. The events surrounding Brom's death, Eragon's departure at the end, and the relationship between Eragon and Arya aren't even close to actual events. The Urgals, were embarrassing. The description given is a brutish humanoid that stands over 6 feet tall, has a grayish hide, ram-like horns, and is extremely muscular; NOT an average Joe made to look like a caveman with face paint and some fake teeth. I could ramble on and on about all the vast differences (and they are vast), but I shall wrap this up with a glimmer of good. The very few redeeming qualities about this movie would have to be the voice part played by Rachel Weisz, which was outstanding, and the special effects which, weren't great, but weren't awful. Overall I would never EVER recommend this movie to anyone who has ever read or plans to read the book. Save yourself the 104 minutes. My recommendation: pick up the book, immerse yourself in the world of Alagaesia as Christopher Paolini intended, and I personally guarantee you will be so much more satisfied.","

"Sorrymanyou","24 March 2007","I really hope, for the sake of the young author, the book is nothing like this movie. This movie stinks. The no talent ass clowns that put it together suck. They should be ashamed of themselves. Let me start with Peter Buchman. The guy is a second rate hack. Look, I'm no ""every day"" critic, but maybe, just maybe, hiring the guy who crafted Jurassic Park 3 was a really, really bad idea. Buchman needs to find a different trade, cause he writes like a bull-whore with a shovel up her ass.Next, Stephan Fangmeier directed his way into the worst edited movie I have seen in a while. Is it supposed to be Bish in nature? (If so, bad move, if not, well, it flows like a B movie and for that, it sucks.) I don't know what ran through these people's minds after they ""finished"" editing it, perhaps they were just happy to get it done, or they had already spent their money, but I can only imagine that they were completely drunk, or stoned, or simply retarded. But let me sum up my points of contention: -Dialog sucks. It's juvenile and stupid and the dragon's lines, what she says, how she sounds when she speaks--all terrible and poorly crafted.-The editing is amateurish and choppy.-The acting is pathetic. Not enough Malkovich, his character was great. Irons had his moments too, and maybe it was just the bad dialog that sunk his character. Edward Speleers ability to get his lines out rivals the talent of Hayden Christiansen in the Star Wars prequels. Overall, the acting was second rate.-The dragon riding scenes are poor at best. If they wanted to make a first person shooter game, thats one thing, but as a movie, the scenes are nauseating and fake.Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone under 10 who likely doesn't know enough to know this movie sucks. Everyone else, read the book and don't waste your time with this shotty garbage.","

"fntstcplnt","10 February 2020","Directed by Stefen Fangmeier. Starring Ed Speleers, Jeremy Irons, Sienna Guillory, Robert Carlyle, Garrett Hedlund, John Malkovich, Djimon Hounsou, Gary Lewis, Alun Armstrong, Chris Egan, Joss Stone, (voice) Rachel Weisz. (PG)Depressingly derivative sword & sorcery yarn finds an orphaned farm boy (Speleers) ""destined"" to become a dragon rider when an egg lands in his lap one day. In no time at all, the hatched beast is fully grown and ready to spirit the bland hero off on a grand adventure, with a seasoned mentor (Irons), a princess in need of saving (Guillory), and a lone rogue warrior on hand to be flashy yet unflappable (Hedlund); if those ""Star Wars"" similarities aren't convincing enough, consider how much dark wizard Carlyle resembles Emperor Palpatine towards the end of the movie. Any chance of it being a familiar-but-fun fantasy mash-up (à la ""Willow"") disappears quickly, since it's also generic, lifeless, weakly-acted, flatly-directed and entirely uninvolving. Scenery looks nifty at times, but the dragon design is anything but easy on the eyes, with weirdly human characteristics on the face and mouth, and Weisz's unsuitably lovely voice coming out of it via awkward telepathy. The opportunity for paycheck-cashing Irons and Malkovich to ham it up is squandered as well--can't it at least be bad in a fun way? Based on a book by Christopher Paolini, written (not surprisingly) when he was a teenager.27/100","

"kcoffey5-551-175217","14 January 2013","If you have read the book, do not watch this movie under any circumstance. It basically slaughters the magic that Christopher Paolini created in the Inheritance trilogy and turns it into a shallow film that will taint your imagination. Many crucial details are left out, leaving a lackluster storyline that does not do anyone justice.I do not know how or why this beautiful novel was translated with such lack of respect for the original content. It could have been an extraordinary film if the director had stuck to the plot. Too many important plot lines were changed- way more than necessary to turn a somewhat lengthy book into an hour and a half film. For those of you who have not read the books, I cannot say whether or not this will entertain you because I have obviously come from a biased standpoint.Overall, my suggestion is to forgo this disaster and stick to the book.","

"myrothe","16 December 2006","I just finished taking my daughter to see Eragon and I gotta say, written by a 12 year old? I can definitely tell. Not bad for a kid I suppose but come on, realistically I have rarely seen such cliché ridden, shallow, high school poetry-esquire writing. Its funny because I had a group of giggling, talking late middle school/early high school girls sitting next to me. They constantly laughed at the corny lines, and talked (whispering, but still audible) constantly about how bad this movie was. Normally this type of thing would irritate me to no end. However I actually didn't mind in the least. I had exactly ZERO emotional investment in either the characters nor the story and gradually found myself actually joining in.It wasn't just them either (they were just doing it constantly) I mean its a troubling sign for a movie when a character is supposedly delivering a heartfelt emotional line, rather than silence half of the audience is laughing. God there was cheezy dialouge.There were a few mildly cool cgi effects (nothing that any movie couldn't have with a decent budget), but nothing to make me want to ever watch it again.HOWEVER, despite the fact that this movie sucked rotten eggs,and actually made me feel oddly embarrassed for being seen there, it in fact did NOT star a single dancing penguin anywhere.

Overall, the graphics were the only thing I enjoyed.

"vip_ebriega","24 May 2008","My Take: The special effects dragon, voiced by Rachel Weisz, is livelier than anyone in this sleazy, tedious fantasy adventure. ERAGON is based on the book by teenager Christopher Paolini, and I haven't read the book yet, but by judging of the movie, it might take a while before I do. ERAGON, as a film, is a completely unoriginal and almost totally tedious attempt at fantasy. I'm not exactly anticipated when this film came out, I now, as I've seen it, I now have the right to be disappointed. The film has very few, if nearly no, new ideas of its own, and owes immensely for taking so much more from George Lucas' STAR WARS. Now, all we need is an R2-D2 and C-3PO knock-off and you have a reason for George Lucas to file a lawsuit. How much can you take from other films within 104 minutes of screen time? Everything seems to be lifted from STAR WARS, from the fact that the lead character is in fact a farm boy, a boy named Eragon (Edward Speelers in his debut) who finds a strange rock-like object which is actually a dragon egg, who is recruited for a mission to fight an evil entity bent on total domination. By now, it has occurred to you that this is almost like Luke Skywalker and his fight with the evil Empire. Completing the total derivativeness of the plot is his mentor named Brom (Jeremy Irons), who talks, walks and breaths old Ben Kenobi. With all his talks about Eragon's mission and duties, it makes you want to think the writer watched STAR WARS way too much.I can go on this forever, whether it's Eragon insisting to save the elf princess Arya (Sienna Guillory) despite the reluctance of his master, or the dragon-rider must be ""one"" with his dragon (change ""dragon"" to ""lightsaber"" and it's fairly obvious), ERAGON hasn't a good idea in its bag. Heck, they even ripped-off the famous STAR WARS scene with the the two moons! If this is the nature of the book, why bring it to the big screen where it has to compete with the real thing? As directed by Stefen Fangmeier, a special effects artist in his directorial debut, ERAGON is doing well when it comes to special effects. The dragon isn't something new in special effects wizardry, but it still looks fine. The voice of Rachael Weisz as the dragon Saphira is the only films' highlight, managing to keep her credibility. Otherwise, ERAGON is still a completely bare-bones fantasy epic, big on budget yet completely empty. Yet another fact that not all books don't spell blockbuster hits. Rating: * out of 5.","

"dantheman0056","7 August 2007","Now dispute the plagiarism that readers of the novel have expressed (mainly Star Wars and Lord of the Rings) if you look at it Eragon has the possibility of at the very least being a medieval action flick with great battle scenes full of magic, warriors, and dragons. Quite frankly it is terrible. The acting was bad and full of cheesy lines (although Racheal Weizz as the voice actress of Saphira plays the role quite well). The battle scenes are cut down to a PG level where they needed to be PG-13. The story is put up as bland and unoriginal on the big screen and needed to be longer to explain the plot. Another huge thing readers of the book will realize they destroyed the plot to an unrecognizable level. The chance of a sequel will be awkward with the unnecessary changes.\ All and All Skip It.And pray for no sequel...","

"skeletonakajoe","12 December 2006","Okay, take a look at this. Eragon has some of the most stunning visual effects ever. Also, the acting is very good, and though it is quite different from the book, it still, how you say, rocks. I recommend it to all, just because. The sets are quite awesome - we should all be thankful that they filmed in Hungary. Jeremy Irons is, as always, awesome, especially in this role. I would have loved to have seen Ian McKellan cast because I think he is incredible, but I think Irons is better for the part. Also, one comment I read said that Ed Speleers is always just solemn - to them, I say that Speleers is not 19, and everyone has a basic expression. Plus, film acting is a lot harder than it seems - just ask the great and powerful 2 time Oscar winner Michael Caine - he would know. Rachel Weisz is perfect for Saphira, and though there are some weird dragon scenes, she is very good. 9/10","

"toddhd","23 December 2006","Eragon seems to receive a ton of flack from fans of the book. I haven't read the book, and so was able to rate the movie without the prejudice of expecting it live up to a pre-conceived idea.The story moves. In fact, it might move bit fast for the necessary character development and bonding, but there is never a point in the movie where you feel like it is boring or sitting still. The action is fast and rampant, and you can't help but cheer when the heroes kick in and soundly thrash the bad guys.The effects are awesome. The dragon is well animated, and I personally thought the magical effects were some of the best I've seen anywhere. Eragon is a wonderful hero, and gives us hope that if an average farm boy can become a hero, then anyone can.This movie is not for the very young, as the dragon and the bad guys are really quite believable and scary. I would say ages 10 and up would appreciate the movie.If you have read the book, then do yourself a favor and skip the movie rather than badmouth it. The movie on its own is a wonderful story, and since it clearly does not follow the book version of the story, it would be silly to even compare the two. Enjoy it for what it is, or skip it altogether. Well worth the price of admission. Had it been a little longer and had a little more character depth, it would have earned a higher rating from me.","

Like they could do better. I guess some people are never satisfied.I started reading the book when I was about 12 or 13 (I'm 15 now) and just got so into it. I was wondering when they would make a movie on it and when I heard they were, I got so excited. I told my mom and my sister to read it too and they both loved it. I love to write too, but I'm not as good as Christopher Paolini. I like books with adventure. I've read all the Harry Potter books that have come out and rate them 10/10. I rate the book Eragon 10.5/10! I have also read Eldest and rate that one 11/10! The ending of that one was so awesome. For school we had to write a persuasive essay and my topic was that every person in the world should read Eragon sometime in their life. It is the best book I've ever read.The movie was no different. My favorite movies include Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, Chronicles of Narnia (new), Harry Potter, and now Eragon. The actors did a wonderful job. For being a first-time actor, Ed Speleers did such a great job on playing Eragon. He was just as I pictured in my mind. Actually he was better! Jeremy Irons was so great too. I loved his voice and could totally tell he was Scar in The Loin King. Sienna Guillory was awesome. She was just as I pictured her too. I'd have to say that my favorite character in the book was Murtagh and it was the same for the movie. He reminds me of an Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars. I hate to leave anyone out, I loved all the actors. They were SO great. What people say about the actors being terrible and ""just in it for the money"" is absurd. I would love to be in a movie like that just as an extra. I would love to see how it is all put together. They also did a wonderful job on creating Saphira and the voice of her was so perfect.Sure the movie was different from the book, but seriously, what movie that was based on a book was exactly like it? Harry Potter wasn't exactly like the books, Chronicles of Narnia wasn't exactly like the book, even Lord of the Rings wasn't exactly like the books. If Eragon was the same as the book, it would probably be 5 to 6 hours long. Then people would complain that it was too long.I don't care what people say. I loved the movie and the directors need to be complimented on, not criticized. They worked so hard, pulled it off and made a really, really, really, awesome movie. I congratulate them and I really hope they keep going and make the next two.","

The movie cut out major characters such as Orik and the important characters that were included only had a couple lines. If you have not yet read the book I recommend you do so. Eragon was absolutely terrible. Some parts were interesting like when Saphira appears to save Eragon in Gil'ead. Many characters were not played by a very good actor either. Edward Speleers' acting career will now be over and how short it was. Djimon Honsou sounded like he had a pool of drool in his mouth and Sienna Guillory didn't even look like an elf. The movie skips many important cities and puts people like Angela the fortune teller in the wrong one. The only thing notable about this movie was the digital effects and Rachel Weisz as Saphira. I pray that someone with more experience will make an Eragon remake be cause readers will be very disappointed.","

"fearfulofspiders","1 September 2008","Seeing this film as plagiarism of varying degrees, I have little, if anything, good to say about this production. Christopher Paolini should be ashamed of himself for what he calls originality, is actually thievery of Star Wars - Episode IV- A New Hope. From the dragon-riders (Jedi) to magic (the Force) to the ever-continuing subplot of betrayal and battles for supremacy.Starting with the acting, this is one wooden movie. Edward Speelers is pretty terrible as the title hero, and Jeremy Irons is trying his hardest to be the next Kenobi or Gandalf. John Malkovich's performances made me think less of the actor, in fact, I have lost a lot of respect because of his most recent performances. To sum it up, Djimon Hounsou is probably the worst of the bunch.The special effects are the best part of the film. While still interweaving with the plagiarism, Saphira is very good looking, though the battles are boring and carbon-copies, the CGI is well done.The writing, as aforementioned, is complete theft of the storyline and elements of Star Wars - Episode IV - A New Hope. Paolini was simply to young when he wrote these, as he thought stealing these points would make him seem original, instead of studying myths and legends. There is absolutely nothing here that is n-e-w. Paolini should see a lawsuit any day now, I hope.Patrick Doyle's score is cliché, with hardly any sweep or complexity. Definitely avoid it at all costs.All in all, Eragon is one disappointment after the other. From lack of originality to just poor execution, this film is a failure. I highly recommend everyone to skip this mediocre production.","

"vampiresan","15 December 2006","Why are so many adaptations of reasonable books so badly done? Is it that the scriptwriters and directors want to remove themselves so much from the source material that they feel the need to stuff it up altogether. Frankly nothing saves this film... it gravitates between being unbelievably slow and sentimental to fights scenes that are so fast and badly directed that it is impossible to tell what the hell is going on. Did they run out of money and decide not to hire a focus puller?The acting by all concerned is woeful but they are really not helped by the trite and simplistic dialogue given to them. The dialogue in the book wasn't anywhere near this bad so why didn't they just use some of that?Rachel Weiss as the voice of Sapphira got the shortest straw with most of her dialogue being stupid, repetitive or downright pointless. They could have cut the whole dragon talking thing and no real information would have been lost. Overall it was so badly done that I am sure it is something that all concerned will drop from their resumes very soon.","

"worldsworstwryter","11 April 2023","Huh, for some reason I always assumed the dragon was the one called Eragon, but I guess not.Either way, this film took an absolute nose dive off a cliff once Jeremy Irons' character was gone. Since the film is almost entirely pieced together out of past tropes and cliches, I knew it was going to happen but even so, I was still protesting at the screen, ""No way- you can't kill off the only likable character in the movie!""Then yeah, they did. And then out of absolutely nowhere (more than halfway through the film at this point) this random character joins the party. And even though he only gets like 3 scenes, he's still more interesting than the main character, and I would actually have preferred the story to be about him journeying with Jeremy Irons' character instead, since their backstories are linked in a way that could've been interesting.But no, instead we just got the usual bland chosen one protagonist, with an extra dose of bad attitude and forced development, which the movie insists on telling us about rather than showing.This is a particularly bad problem regarding the relationship between Eragon and his dragon. We are repeatedly told about this supposed special bond, but we never actually get to see any of this friendship growing. In fact, there are more scenes where he's being grumpy with the dragon and telling her what to do, than there are bonding scenes, it's just frustrating.","

Obviously, we have a bunch of children here as reviewers -- who decided (by reading the book) what the movie should look like, and now (sob sob) it's different.Grow up! Movies are not books. If you can't get that thru your head, give up one or the other.The flying scenes were the best I've every seen, the dragon (obviously modeled after a young kitty cat) was totally captivating. I loved the scenery (reminded me of places I've been too all over the world) and most of the characters (good guys anyway) reminded me of people I have met, known, and loved.Too bad, kiddies, that you couldn't see the movie with fresh eyes. And too bad that the reviews seem to have killed it. (It's doing poorly at Box Office.) rz","

The species of some characters were changed- which is a big deal and completely ruins everything. Some characters were left out entirely. The dialogue and development of the story were simplified, especially Saphira's. The actual ending was changed in an unnecessary manner. The only credit I'll give them is the quality of the special effects. They screwed any chances of a sequel.","

"vefster","20 December 2006","The the writers even read the book?!?!? I believe that Eragon and Eldest are two of the best books i've read and the movie was disgraceful. It seamed more like they read the summary on the back of the book and made a movie of what they thought it was about. So what happened to the dwarfs? the scar he gets from Durza? and a million other things they left out? They killed the Ra' Zac easily when the Ra' Zac are still in the third book. The Urgals instead of being a different race they are just barbaric men with tattoos. Arya leaves to Ellesméra without Eragon?? how can they even make a second movie based on the second book. My personal opinion is the director didn't really care for the book and only made the movie as a job. A director shouldn't make a film unless he really likes the idea and desires to make it come to life. I was impressed on how well movies like The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) and the Lord of the Rings Trilogy did in making the movies as real and as close to the books as they can. I know that they can't fit an entire book in but they could have at least given the book the respect it deserves. The Harry Potter series aren't the best at being accurate but they're close enough to give them credit. I should not feel like a did Hollywood a disfavor by supporting a movie, which is how i felt after seeing it tonight. If i were them i would destroy any evidence of this new film and start over from scratch, and put people in charge who actually have a love for the book. Why did Christopher Paolini give the permission to disgrace and destroy his story. I am currently a film student and i would have volunteered all my time to help them make the movie because apparently they needed all the help they could get.","

I love fantasy stories and this movie values a great one, bringing it to life with amassing cg works and great actors. You can fell the love in every scene and you want it never to finish. This kind of artistry helps you disconnect from the real world and imagine that any of your dreams can come to life, this gives you the power to move along and search for solutions... at list that is how I fell. I hope that some day more people will get to appreciate the hard work that goes into something and try to read between the lines and thus discovering the true meaning. In conclusion, I would like to say thank you to all of those who decided to bring to the screens Christopher Paolini's ""Eragon"" and to all who joined this project and I really wish that despite the general low grade, they will see that half of those who voted loved the movie and that they will continue the story :)","

"jez999","24 December 2006","Which of the following are new, interesting ideas in the fantasy genre? Fire-breathing dragons; the unready, humble hero who is chosen for his 'heart', not his fortune or fame; the attractive damsel who is in need of rescue and love; the sacred item that is shrouded in mystery; the old, wise sage who was once a brave hero; the fortune-teller who predicts with the help of some creature's entrails; the daring rescue from a dark castle; the brave hideout of rebels fighting an evil king; the epic battle between Good and Evil.If you said, ""None"" - correct! Maybe one or two would be appropriate in a film coming out today, but by and large they've all been done and something new is required to make entertaining viewing for anyone but the most die-hard fantasy fanatic. Unfortunately, this film is comprised of nothing but the above, and feels like a cut-and-paste job from Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and various other well-known epics. The premise, storyline, and dialogue are so thinly worn one could reasonably replace the dictionary definition of 'cliché' with 'Eragon'. It's depressing that people like Jeremy Irons, Rachel Weisz, and Joss Stone got themselves caught up in this, because it sure doesn't live up to their reputations.The film feels like a very bad adaptation, that skims over and/or misses out much of the plot and character development, from a novel that was so boring it should never have been published, let alone turned into a movie. The predictability of the plot and the one-liners is so relentless that at times it was physically painful to watch. Gems such as, ""she is a part of your past, and of your future"", and ""the days of the dragon riders will return"" (5 minutes before they, erm, returned), abound.Don't waste 2 hours of your life watching this rubbish. I regret having done so.","

"margrettgreat","24 December 2006","Horrible and very funny adaptation of the popular children's book that plays like a bad SNL skit that is trying to parody ""The Lord of the Rings"" than the book that it's based on. The screenplay is a major mess with dialog that even little kids would find stupid and the performances are almost all laughably bad. Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich should be ashamed of themselves for even agreeing to be in this film and Djimon Hounsou should start reading his scripts a little more carefully. The only redeeming thing about this crappy film is the great voice over work of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give the dragon Saphira more talent and range in terms of solid acting than all the human actors working in the film. The C.G.I work done for Saphira was also well done, making her more lifelike than her human co-stars as well. Outside of Rachel Weisz's great voice acting and the great special effects for the Dragon Saphira, this movie is more and less a bad comedy that did not deserve nether of them.","

"animflashdragon","16 December 2006","last night I was fortunate enough to see Eragon on its day of release, and I was optimistic about the fact that it had received such negative reviews, one friend in particular at school spent great pleasure all of yesterday morning parading a printout in front of my face telling me that the film had received 1/10 Christmas turkeys, and I spent the rest of the day telling him I would not trust the opinion of a website that rated their movies in turkeys.Going into the film I was not discouraged however, and as the film started, I thought they had hit the nail on the head, everything was as it should have been, despite for the lack of several key characters from the book never being mentioned by name. Roran looks exactly like the main character in question, and when I first saw him I actually mistook him for Ed Speleers. They have completely cut out several locations, such as Terim, and have instead had Angela's fortunetelling in Daret, and that important part of the plot was rushed by, with virtually none of Angela's predictions from the book being mentioned, the possibility of eldest begins to look slimmer.The end of the film however is the most disappointing, the battle of Farthen Dur, which is supposed to be thousands of Urgals charging through tunnels (they have also been replaced by men with tribal markings on their faces), instead a pathetic wall 5 feet in width is blown down and at max 40 men run through, I was not impressed. and as for the Varden being sheltered in a dwarf city, where the number of dwarfs greatly outnumbers the humans, by dwarfs I mean dwarf, just one short Scottish guy with a beard. Another thing which really bugs me, is the constant talking between Durza and the king, who has not yet been glimpsed in the first two books. The king is supposed to be constantly looking for the dwarfs and the Varden to try and destroy them, yet on the map of Alagaesia he has neatly pinned on his wall, he has all of their cities neatly LABELLED, come on fox. We also get a glimpse of Shurikan right at the end.so, the chances of seeing eldest, by the end of the movie, Roran is gone without a trace, and to bring him back would look very odd as he left to avoid conscription, the Ra,Zac are both already dead, there is one sole dwarf, no Somemnbum, none of the story of blessing that child (for which I am very thankful), the twins are none existent despite being in the cast list, there is no mention of the king having any other dragon eggs, Katrina isn't even in the film, and Sloan the butcher seems mildly kind to Eragon, not like the heartless monster in the book.I could go on, but I wont,because despite all this, it is a brilliant movie, even if it does feel a little rushed, (it was a big book after all), if you haven't read the book the plot may be a little confusing, but it is still a brilliant movie, not the longest movie in the world, but still brilliant.If anyone thinks I am tearing down the actors, then don't, the acting (especially from Eragon and Brom), is amazing, the movie is amazing, but whoever wrote the script should have harsh words spoken to them, the style of the script leads me to believe this movie was written by three people in a darkened room being paid £3:00 an hour, one reading a child rewritten copy of lord of the rings, one who is actually reading the book, abet just the blurb on the back, and god know what the third was reading.In summary brilliant movie, brilliant acting, brilliant special effects, just scriptwriters who should be buried in mounds of their own horrible writing. They haven't completely ruined Eragon, but they have most certainly ruined eldest.phew, glad thats off my chest","

That is not all; a narrator will tell you everything as well in case you are blind. I think this movie will be used in cinematic classes in universities all over the world as an example how not transform a book to a movie. Just buy the poster do not see the movie.PS I liked Dragonheart, Narnia, The Lord of the Rings Movies, I do play Diablo II.","

I just now saw this, after having just finished both the Eragon and Eldest books.If you saw the movie, and liked it... or even better, didn't like it, Read the books! The movie only barely follows the book's storyline. It had dragons, a king, and a few key people. Beyond that, they are nothing alike. There are no soldiers in the town in the book, they are not forcing people to join the army. Brom is not an ass, or a Rider ashamed of his past. He's a great hero! One who has the respect of many. I won't spoil what's in the book, but he was not in Eragon's town to hide from his past. What a joke.Second, where are the ELVES? My god, Arya is supposed to be an elf! And there are supposed to be dwarfs in the mountain hideout for the Varden. They didn't have the giant stone that Arya broke, in fact... Arya sure doesn't look like an elf.People have probably analyzed this pretty in depth, so I don't go on about it...All I can say is that the books are GREAT, and the movie did NOT follow the books at all. The movie is a joke, and is a horrible one at that.","

It also manages to pilfer concepts from,Harry Potter, and complete scenes from Star Wars as well. Indeed during the movie I often wonder when an Ewok would jump out to help overthrow the Emperor ""Derza"". The director of this movie should have been shot on site. The screen play writer should be impaled for his terrible writing. The teenager who wrote the book should be tarred, feathered, and run out of town.It's hard to blame actors, for a bad script, bad editing, and out theft of ideas.","

"kermitthefroggy","16 December 2006","Oh, boy, am I in mourning. Eragon came out yesterday in England, so I and a few friends went to see it last night. We were not amused.If you hadn't read the book, I'm afraid I doubt you'd even be able to work out the plot line. No real explanation, no character development, no coherence with the original book plot line... if I hadn't been on a severe sugar high, I would have cried on the way home.What the hell was Murtagh doing? Turning up all over the place, randomly saving the overly corny, badly acted main character's behind, falling from trees, being overly American (Miiirtagh? WTF?)- no offence guys, and just saying, basically, 'I expect you to trust me, a random stranger, and I'll take you, another random stranger, to the Varden, somewhere 15 minutes ago you didn't really want to go to, and in the book, somewhere there was no chance in hell I wanted to go near either. Screw the author, I'm Fox's property now!' Oh, dear dear dear. Not good.When you sacrifice plot for visuals, you do have to have good visuals too, surprisingly enough, but they didn't manage on that count either, some of the time; though I'll give them credit for Saphira. Severe warping of the text- i.e. taking a blunt axe to it, hammy dialogue, bad acting (Jeremy Irons tried valiantly, bless him), often bodged CGI and severe plot holes were the failings of this film.However, my hat off to the good actors who were involved- one only in a vocal part, who would have excelled if other parts of the film had let them.","

I am currently reading the book and, yes it may not follow the story line Word for Word but they did a good job for the amount of time they had. For instance Garrow actually dies at Horst's house and in the movie he actually dies when Brom throws a torch onto the pile of wood. And in the book it describes Brom as a old man, because he uses a cane and has a gray beard, yet in th Movie he is young and agile. and it seems like the only thing that changed is the lighting i saw absolutely no weather changes. I know it sounds like i am trashing this movie, but truly I'm not I'm just stating the things that could have helped it.I truly hope that they make a ""Eldest"" movie so i can see what that turns out like because they end of the movie with Galbatorix slashing away the map and a dragon being hidden behind it was a really suspense full ending.","

"adudewhoiscool","19 December 2006","""Eragon"" is an extremely disappointing movie. As a fan of the book, this reviewer wanted to love this movie, but it just did not live up to its potential. With all of the hype, you would expect ""Eragon"" to be great, maybe not the level of ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Harry Potter,"" or ""Chronicles of Narnia,"" but just a notch below those. It is a shame that something so hyped up could be so disappointing. It would more logical to save your $8.75+ and either watch ""Casino Royale"" or spend a little more and buy the book, ""Eragon.""King Galbatorix has slaughtered all the legendary dragons and their riders, driving the rebels into hiding. Luckily, hope still is possible because Princess Arya is able to export the last remaining dragon egg from Galbatorix. This egg ends up in the possession of Eragon. This dragon, named Saphira, has immediately bonded with Eragon. Sadly, this makes Eragon a target for King Galbatorix and his sorcerer henchman, Durza. Eragon soon finds his family under attack. To his luck, a man named Brom is there to rescue him. Brom leads him on a journey that teaches him the ways of dragons and magic. Is Eragon ready to face these dangers?If you enjoyed the book, you will not like this movie. Many of the key characters are nonexistent. Many of the locations were not there either. They even left out some key plots in the book. It almost seems like the screenwriters just skimmed the book, and put only the ""key"" elements. It almost felt like the makers only cared about the buck and not the film itself. It is difficult to fit a whole book into just one movie, but they could have done some modification here and there in order to do that. If you look at recent films like ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Harry Potter,"" ""Spiderman,"" and ""X-Men"" (before ""The Last Stand"") those movies were not 100% perfect to the book, but there was enough modification for people to not mind.The most bothersome part of this movie was the length. It is a known fact that you cannot make an epic fantasy with a runtime of only 99 minutes long. ""Dumb and Dumber"" was seven minutes longer. What were they thinking making a fantasy movie that was shorter then a buddy comedy? They should have increased the run time by 60 minutes. This reviewer would have no problems sitting through a 150-minute movie and fans of the book would probably not mind either. This proves that they cared more about the number of screening then the quality of the movie.Due to the short runtime, there are many plot holes and very little character development. You have a hard time caring for any of the characters on the screen. Everything seemed rushed when it never needed it to be. Some things were not explained very well. If you had not read the book, you might have been confused. The blame should be going to the screenwriters and the director, Stefen Fangmeier. This is more proof that the makers did not care enough.The acting was mediocre at best. When you have a cast with names like: Jeremy Irons (as Brom), John Malkovich (as King Galbatorix), Djimon Hounsou (as Ajihad), Rachel Weis (as Saphira), and among others, you would expect at least better then average. This reviewer's friend said it best, ""When the actors weren't acting like robots, they were overacting."" All of the blame should be going to the screenwriters because there is no other way you can look at that. The only actors to do a better then mediocre job were Jeremy Irons as Brom and Rachel Weis as the telepathic voice of Saphira.Another problem was the music. A good movie has an amazing film score that draws you into the movie as it were another character. You should not expect ""Lord of the Rings"" quality, but you should at least hope for something that could draw you into the story and make you care a bit more. An Avril Lavigne song, ""Keep Holding On,"" is played at the beginning of the end credits. This reviewer has nothing against Avril, but it makes you wonder what ""20th Century Fox"" was thinking deciding to put a mainstream teenybopper song in a fantasy movie.The movie was not all disappointment. The visuals were amazing, especially Saphira. This Saphira, with the scales and feathers, was a unique dragon to look at. Whenever Saphira and Eragon were in flight, you should be in awe. This is not surprising considering that Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), a visual effects company created by George Lucas, were in charge for all the special effects. Plus when you have a $100 million budgeted fantasy movie, you better expect some great special effects.Overall, this movie was a disappointment. Sure the visuals were amazing and Jeremy Irons and Rachel Weis tried their best to save this movie, but unfortunately the makers did not seem to care about the quality of the film. While reading the book, ""Eragon,"" it was obvious that Christopher Paolini was no JRR Tolkien, it is also clear that Stefen Fangmeier is no Peter Jackson. ""Eragon"" probably would be more enjoyable if you do read the book, but it is extremely doubtful. Skip this title but if you have to see it, wait for the DVD rental.","

"ElijahCSkuggs","15 December 2006","This review is mainly for people who have read the book.First off, I personally really enjoyed the book, so I had high hopes for this flick. But as a bigger movie fan than book lover I knew better than to let my hopes get too high. Which is why I didn't hate this movie, but I can tell you I certainly didn't enjoy it. Eragon seems incredibly old hat, like a movie mixed with about five others together. It's also filled with problems that should have Paolini a little frustrated. Even if you didn't read the book, and you're even a little on the ball, you can predict almost everything that happens in this first installment of the trilogy.The lead actor who plays Eragon is probably the next big thing for middle schoolers across the nation. Unfortunately he's only a face with no real acting skills. Sure he can pretend to cry or act outraged, big whoop. Saphira was fine I suppose, she roared and made snappy remarks when needed. The rest of the cast was fine also, with Irons probably being the one who delivered the lines the best. The Urguls and Razac were absolutely great in the book but in this they are pretty damn weak. Urguls are supposed to be huge hulking monsters, but in this they are played by large men with tattoos and red eyes. And the Razac are supposed to be talkative, birdlike creatures who eat humans. They looked more like a member of Slipknot combined with Scarecrow from Batman Begins. If you're going into this movie, please try to dismiss everything you know about the book. Then and only then will you possibly enjoy it. The movie is at least pretty nice looking, CGI is a little too much sometimes, but it is definitely a vibrant looking film.With all that being said, it's easy to say if you're in middle school or you aren't a huge movie buff/critic, and you enjoyed Chronicles of Narnia, you will most likely enjoy Eragon.","

"Vineflare","23 September 2008","OK, I DID read the books before I saw the movie, and I enjoyed them, and I got all excited for the movie. Yes, it wasn't like the book, but seriously, it can still be a good movie! I LOVED it! As long as the movie keeps the main plot, it shouldn't matter. Sure, some parts were weird and not all acting in movies are perfect, but the movie shouldn't be put down so much. The one thing I didn't like a lot is what most people only like about the movie: Saphira's voice. I wasn't fond of it much, but it didn't stop me from loving the movie. I learned to like it, which is what people need to do more with the Eragon movie. I hope that the sequels come out, whether or not they are like the books, for some of us appreciate what people work so hard to make for us to enjoy.","

"camelot2302","19 December 2006","I've just come back from the cinema in a daze. After reading the excellent Eragon book, I was really looking forward to seeing it on the big screen. But what I saw bears absolutely no relation to the book.For a start, the casting is all wrong. The casting agent for this movie should be strung up by the ankles. The most awful casting choice was Djimon Hounsou as Ajihad. The costumes he and his Varden wore made them look like they were going to Goldmember's house for a 1970's disco evening.What really riles me is that the movie is totally rushed and complete scenes are completely missed out. Characters from the book are totally discarded in the movie, other characters are placed in totally different scenes just for cinematic effect and the movie invents scenes not in the book. One example of this are John Malkovich's scenes. In the book, Galbatorix hardly appears and hardly utters a word. In the movie, he can hardly keep his mouth shut. Obviously the scenes were invented to give Malkovitch more screen time to keep his actor ego intact.The only casting choice I just about agree with was Robert Carlyle as Durza but even then new scenes were invented for the movie and the scene where Eragon & Durza face off is a total fabrication on the part of the movie director. Brom's death at the hands of Durza was also completely fabricated.But the biggest blunder of all - Eragon appears at the secret city of the Varden, a city built and owned by the Dwarfs - and yet there is NOT ONE SINGLE DWARF IN THE WHOLE MOVIE! I am truly deeply disappointed with this movie which was rushed and botched up in a quick attempt to cash in on the success of the book. I'm hoping that when the trilogy is finished by Paolini that a true fan (like Peter Jackson and the Lord of the Rings) will take a more fonder view of the stories and do a fabulous remake. But I fear that is a long time away.My advice can be summed up like this : if you've read the book, avoid the movie.But hey, George Lucas would be proud of the CGI dragon and the cinematic special effects.","

"jayhawker625","18 December 2006","I think that eragon the movie sucked and that if you are going to make a movie based on a book it should at least be about the book. i think that the director needs to stick to special effects and for those that seen Jurassic park three the also know that it sucked so i don't think that - anyone - should - ever - have him write a movie again. To paolini i think you may have ruined your first book by letting that writer guy do write the script and don't let them use him for eldest (if they make a movie).i think the cast was good though, ed speilers did a good job playing eragon, i like everyone except the guy who played mugtagh, i didn't get tn same feeling as i did in the book when i read about him.","

"poojucu","16 December 2006","Many who have read this epic fantasy would have been absolutely thrilled when a film was announced. It harbours some of the biggest actors in the business like John Malkovich, Robert Carlyle, and academy award nominee Jeremy Irons, all of whom provide solid performances with the material they were given. The special effects are also magnificent especially the flying scenes with Eragon and Saphira. However nothing else in this movie actually works. First and foremost it is let down by poor writing. Some of the mainstream actors only get two to three lines which limits their ability's immensely. John Malkovich for instance who plays the evil King Galbatorix only has a few lines lines in the whole film,whereas a miscellaneous butcher at the beginning has enough lines to be counted as a main character. . Many of the lines are also clichéd and simple, poor one liners are placed throughout and the humor is too say the least unintelligent and unimaginative. Structure wise Eragon also fails to impress. Many of the scenes bear are striking resemblance to Lord of the Rings, and important aspects about the main character Eragon and Saphira are wrong to what they are in the book. Overall this film tries to captivate the audience with its stunning special effects and stellar cast, but in the end any movie lover will not be able to get past the horrible writing and simplistic structure. Stay away unless are a absolutely devoted fan","

"the_teen","16 December 2006","WHY?????????? OK I am a HUGE fan of the Inheritence Trilogy and was expecting a lot out of this movie for all the hype but it was AWEFULL!!!!!! The story was good but it lacked in any depth to even connect you emotionally with any of the characters. It moved through the whole story faster than any movie I have ever seen. I was with some people who had never read the books and they were really bored the whole time. It lacked anything to keep you interested. We just had fun listening to how Peter Buchman (the screenplay writer) rewrote almost every line in the the book to make everything dramatic but what more can you expect from a guy whose only movie he has written is Jurassic Park 3! ANd yes the special effects were great (although Im still not sure why Saphira had feathered wings) of course they will be great when the only experience your director has is special effects supervisor for a lot of great movies. Over all I would say the acting was fine but VERY misguided and the lines horribly adapted. A poor choice in Director and Writer. Don't blame the actors. One more thing to rant about. 1 hour and 40 minutes???????????? WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! There could have at least been 20-30 minutes of good solid detail that could have made the whole movie WAY more interesting but no. They decide to sacrifice making the movie interesting just to make it under 2 hours. I would MUCH rather sit and watch a good long movie than a short bad one.","

It will sit on the top of the list with ""Gili"" and ""Justin and Kelly"" as one of the worst movies of all time to ever hit a theater screen. The directing in general was the worst I'd ever seen. The way the camera was used just didn't work. Stefen F did the worst job of making a film and the best job of screwing up a great book series! There were slow motion dramatic shots when they weren't needed. The movie had WAAAAAY too many clichés and corny phrases. The books were a real good read, do not get me wrong, but the movie was the worst I'd seen in almost a decade! DO NOT see this movie! It is worth neither your time nor money!","

Where is Teirm, Dras-Leona, or even Tronjheim? Did Brom kill the Razac, I don't think so. Where is Hrothgar and Jeod? What happen with Roran? The Beor Mountains have over ten miles high, I don't have seen nothing like that in this movie.

I realize that they needed to cut out a lot of the story to be able to fit it all into one movie, but Brom didn't even die the way he was supposed to, Murtagh didn't get kidnapped at the end, Arya went to Ellesmera alone and she didn't even have elf-ears for Christ's sake!! How many elves would decide to go 'incognito' as human? I really hope they don't decide to do any more movies from this trilogy. Just leave this story-line alone so that fans can remember it fondly.I would say that maybe with the next movie, they could try and go back to the original story-line, but I don't think they can even fix how horribly they have messed this up.","

"jeggo182","20 December 2006","This is one of the worst book to movie I have ever seen. Not surprising though as the screenplay was written by the same guy who wrote the screenplay for the travesty that was Jurassic Park 3. I mean did he even read the book? The movie is like a horrible version of Eragon on crack. They go from Daret (which was stupidly shown) to the foothills of the Beor Mountains in what is depicted in like a day. Then when Durza makes Arya tell Eragon where she was he and Saphira fly to Gil'ead in another day. Where were the plains? The desert? or any of the other multitude of things left out? The movie was so jumpy and wrong it made me want to leave the theater. The characters were OK but there was only two races, humans and dragons. Elves? no. Urgals? no. Dwarfs? no. I discounted the Razaac because they were so hideously incorrect. Farthen Dur understandably would have been hard to reproduce, but how they made it was stupid. All in all I say is don't watch and we should start a petition to get Peter Jackson to remake it because you know if he is the director it will actually have different races.","

Yes, the writing sucked, Saphira wasn't a dragon, Arya wasn't an elf, dwarfs didn't exist, etc. But everyone complains about how it was an affront to Paolini's books. But really it's all his fault. He was originally offered a consulting position(translation: god of the film) and he said no. The real problem with this movie is that the author didn't care enough about the film to help with it. Idiot. Has he ever seen what happens in Hollywood when the author doesn't have a say (exception: LOTR). In summary, the director, writers, and producers deserve some blame (none on the actors, they did what they could with what they had) but we should mainly place blame on Paolini rather than offer him our sympathy.","

"thedriver829","15 December 2016","On my 11th birthday, I remember the first gift I opened before I went to school was the book Eragon. As a kid who loved Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings (and still do to this day), I was excited to read into this newer fantasy book. I enjoyed it very much as a kid, and to this day I still think it is a good book despite a few flaws I've noticed more now that I'm older.And of course, around the time I read the Eragon book, the film adaptation was getting ready to come out. I was so excited. I was expecting a film on par with The Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia. Sadly, two things started to discourage me as the film's release grew closer: 1) The film's MPAA rating was PG and 2) the film's running time was only 104 minutes. This got me worried, and the reviews for the film by critics and fans didn't exactly help. Needless to say, I was disappointed by this adaptation, but not just because it took out some of my favorite parts from the book, but because it wasn't a good movie either.For those of you who are not familiar with the book, Eragon is based off the book by Christopher Paolini, who started writing it when he was only 15 years old and got it published when he was 18. The story is set in the magical world of Alagaesia, which was once ruled by a group of warriors known as the Dragon Riders. However, one day a rider named Galbatorix betrays the riders and kills them all, making himself king over Alagaesia. Fast forward a few hundred/thousand years later and we meet a young boy named Eragon, who stumbles upon a magical blue stone while hunting in the wilderness. He originally thinks that he can use it to buy meat for his family, but he quickly learns that the stone is actually a dragon egg. And when the dragon egg hatches, Eragon becomes the next dragon rider.As you can tell by reading the synopsis, this story is very similar to other fantasy films such as Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, etc. Of course, this was also a criticism of the book as well, but at least it had likable characters, epic action scenes, and a great level of detail that brought the world to life. These things were at least present in order to make the story compelling, even if it is beat by beat the story of Star Wars. This film version has barely any of that. The characters aren't fleshed out enough to where you care about them. The action is dumbed down in order to create a PG fantasy film for children. Alagaesia itself isn't set apart from any other fantasy worlds we've seen before. The movie just feels like no effort was really put into it except when it came to the visual effects, which are almost too good for this movie.This is mostly due to a really poor script. I'm not just talking about the dialogue, which is some of the worst I've ever heard (""I'm the rider and I say we go""), but the way the story is set up feels like they just took a few scenes from the book and slapped it together to make a movie that was under two hours so they could make a quick buck. Characters appear that have very little screen time and ultimately feel pointless. Even characters that provide importance to the later books are minimized or just simply don't appear at all. It's not structured well, and you can tell that the passion for the source material that fueled the makers of LOTR and Harry Potter is not here at all.Even the action sequences are not all that spectacular. Part of me wants to blame the film's PG rating, but we've seen other movies with this rating that were able to create epic and enjoyable action scenes. The only part that is really enjoyable and entertaining is the final confrontation between Eragon and Durza, the film's main antagonist, which also leads to an scene afterward that had quite a bit of emotion to it. However, anyone expecting epic battle sequences on par with LOTR are probably going to be as disappointed as I was.As far as the acting goes, there are actually a few good performances here, the best of which being Jeremy Irons as Brom. You can tell that he was having fun with the role and was doing his best with the material he was given. Ed Speleers also does a fair job as Eragon, and had this film actually been successful, I would have been interested in seeing him star in more films. Djimon Honsu is also good in his brief role as Ajihad, and Rachel Weisz does a decent job as the voice of Saphira. Most of the other actors fall flat, with the two worst performances coming from John Malkovich, who looks like he's ready to stop shooting and get his paycheck, and Robert Carlile, who takes what could be a compelling villain and makes him absolutely silly.Ultimately, Eragon is wasted potential. It's a movie that could have been great had they put more effort into everything other than the visual effects and handled the adaptation process a little more seriously. I'm not saying that a movie has to be 100% faithful to the source material, but in this case, it would have worked better for the movie and for the potential sequels that could have come from it. In the end, it's not one of the worst movies ever made, but it is definitely one that was disappointing to me and other fans of the book, as well as those looking for the next LOTR or Harry Potter.","

"bkoganbing","20 December 2006","After just coming from a screening of Eragon, I was interested that George Lucas produced this film. That seemed only fitting because young Christopher Pasolini totally ripped this story off from Star Wars and gave it a medieval never never land setting.That being said, I did enjoy this fantasy very much, thought the special effects were great and the players in the cast most appealing. Young Eragon played by Ed Speelers finds a bright blue oval shaped object and keeps it. It turns out to be a dragon's egg and he keeps it and nurses it. When it hatches it's a bouncing baby dragon and a she dragon at that. The dragon's voice is done by Rachel Weisz and while I have to say it doesn't take the place of Sean Connery's voice in Dragonheart, still it's a nice performance.I shouldn't go any farther because if you know the plot of the first Star Wars film you know exactly what happens. Ed Speelers is the Luke Skywalker of the film and he's making a screen debut and a most auspicious one. I understand he was almost cast as Peter Pevensie in The Chronicles of Narnia, the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. I could have seen him in that part as well.Acting honors go to Jeremy Irons as the Obi Wan Kenobe of Dragon Riders who breaks in Eragon and teaches him the skills of the dragon riding trade.It's a given like Star Wars there will most definitely be a sequel as too many plot threads were left loose and several characters left hanging so to speak.It's a nice holiday film for the family and I'm glad George Lucas produced it. It certainly is cheaper than a plagiarism suit.","

Now about the movie... Much like Harry Potter's, which is a story that I loved (I've read each boom about 20 times) I got very disappointed. The books were great, the movies were awful and are going from bad to worst. About ""Eragon"", the only thing I like in this movie was the special effects, even though Saphira does look to have feathers in it's wings. After reading such a great story in Eragon's pages I was looking forward to watch this piece of art... now i realized it's nothing more than a piece of crap. Bad acting, to much of the initial story cut, and way too many invented parts. The only part I really liked was the fresh-born Saphira. The movie really nothing to do with Paolini's excellent written and imagined story. Sorry folks, but I think the best way to improve is receiving critics and learning from our mistakes. Try to read ""Lord of the Rings"" and watch the respective movie, and try to get the differences on it...Sam","

The costumes in the beginning were pretty cool, but as the movie progressed to amour and a more formal look, they became embarrassingly horrible. Jeremy Irons made the best of a bad role. And Edward Speleers has promise. The other actors? Judging by their performances here, uniformly terrible. I know you have to change details of a book to adapt it to film, but I'm baffled as to why they made the omissions and changes they did. Christopher Paolini's book deserved better.","

Many of it's elements are good, I like most of the acting, some of the decorations and locations etc. - they are not brilliant maybe but still quite good. But they wasted it for a really, really stupid, simple and just crappy screenplay that is almost 100% a copy of various elements from fantasy or sci-fi stories, books and films and moreover those copied elements are usually the most recognizable ones from those parent stories, such type everyone remembers even not being a fantasy fan. So, for such a waste of resources, the potential and on the end my time - 1 of 10. Don't bother to watch it even if you are a fantasy fan and especially if you are older than, say, 10.","

I mean this isn't a movie its a slide show of special effects. I think I'm going to wander in traffic...Truly I believe that Fox believe they could back a LOTR without spending as much money. The actors you can tell are much better than what is shown in Eragon. But they thought that graphics are more important than character development. I mean two Academy Award winners are in the film and they cannot save the film. To show how bad this film is there is one scene in the movie where Eragon has no bow the next seen he has one?","

To compensate did they scoop up titans for their director or writer? NO. We had no names creating this movie without any direction or consultation from the writer of the book himself. The end result? An ill-paced movie with boring characters and a plot that doesn't even attempt to stay true to the novel. The only ""positive"" you could take is that the visual effects were decent for 2006. It breaks my heart that the series was effectively killed by this abomination of a movie, because I thoroughly enjoyed the novels. 12 years later I'm still patiently waiting for a remake, because this movie will never be watched again.","

"amillsey","14 December 2006","Reviews of Eragon, particularly from critics, have been very mixed, and I went to see this movie with mixed feelings of anticipation and apprehension. Thanfully, only the first was justified. Ed Speleers is great as the eponymous hero, delivering a performance in-keeping with his character. Jeremy Irons is brilliant as Brom (but what else can you expect?) and Robert Carlyle is as creepy a villain as you could hope for. Of course, certain elements from the books are disregarded to ease the transition to film, but they do not interfere with the flow of the story. The scenery is spectacular, the sets stunning, the acting (mostly) stellar and the special effects awesome. My one sticking point is in the casting of Galbatorix and Ajihad, two characters who need the most charisma, yet John Malkovich and Djimon Honsou are very wooden in their delivery. A good all-round international casting broke up the monotony I deplore in most movies where the villain is English and the hero American - in this case, the hero(es) are English, one of the villains is American and the other is English. I don't know if it was intentional or not, but this conveyed some of the far-reaching arm of Galbatorix. This movie is no 'Lord of the Rings' or 'Harry Potter', nor does anyone have any right to compare them. Eragon is its own movie, despite the current trend for fantasy films. Those who aren't fans of the books will be able to appreciate it as well as those who are. A triumph for all involved.","

It's as if the script writer was writing from spark notes, but spilled his coffee on them and filled in the blank spots with whatever he felt like. They didn't include the three major races (the dwarfs looked to be very slightly shorter people but other than that, they were not mentioned). If they are going to continue the movies on into the series, I can't see how they will be in any way consistent, although that hasn't seemed to matter up to this point. Public outcry will surely persuade the filmmakers to reconsider the release of the second film. I personally am willing to say, if something is not changed, I will not be attending.","

Everyone I know so far has enjoyed this movie, and we're are planning a third stop by the theater to see it. This is probably the best movie I've seen this year.Don't follow all of the negative comments - go see the movie for yourself and enjoy it. It's a great movie, I can't wait for the second and third! (The books are pretty awesome, too!)","

"bbp5003","15 December 2006","This movie did a great injustice to the Book. As an Eragon book fan, i found myself struggling to sit through this movie. It mixed up events (the Razaac chasing Eragon & Brom when in the book it was the other way around... Durza Killing Brom, when in the book it was the Razaac, and so on...), cut out events (Tierm was completely erased form the movie, and many key characters like the Varden's magic using twins and Orik the dwarf who accompanies Eragon throughout book two as well as being his guide throughout tronjheim in book one, and so on...) added new events (the fight scene at the end with Saphira and Eragon fighting Durza & his beast and Saphira getting her neck injured severely, which never occurred in the book, Eragon kills durza because Saphira causes Durza to lose focus by smashing through a giant diamond...). The locations throughout the movie were horrible, with my example being Tronjheim, the dwarf city, too many details were left out and the sets looked small and unrealistic. Also, the movie moved very fast because it being only 100 minutes it had too much information to fit in to too short of a running time. At times i found it to be very confusing and the only reason i knew what was happening was because i have read the books and am very familiar with the story. I would suggest to anyone who is relatively interested in this story to read the book and not see this movie, it is a disgrace to the book.","

"umustright","15 December 2006","I'd been excited about this movie for a long time, as I've read the books twice and really enjoyed the creativity of the story, as well as the rich characters. Several things made this movie a walk-out (which is exactly what I did): 1) It seems only several points of the book were used as guidelines for the movie and all the filler in between was fabricated from some story other than Eragon. There are many hunt/flee action movies out there, but the beauty of this book belonged to some major details which were completely neglected by the movie (such as the fact that Eragon was hunting the Razac, not the other way around, that Brom never wanted to take Eragon to the Varden, or that Arya was never actually conscious during the greater part of Eragon, or the fact that Eragon was never ordered to be killed by the king.) 2) The dialogue seemed awkwardly pieced together. The movie would jump from scene to scene with out any good flow, leaving the film choppy and distracting.3) There really only seemed to be two races: Humans and Dragons. Arya, who is supposed to be an elf, showed no physical attributes of one. Durza did not have any traits of a shade (except maybe fore some scary chapped lips towards the end of the film). The dwarfs were missing...4) Finally, the set was awful. In particular was Galbatorix' layer which basically was a big red sheet on the wall with a fancy chair. No one was every in the room with him except for Durza, making it seem he was living in some cave. Also, this man is supposed to be so powerful and evil, but gives barely any impression of it with his lack of feelings and dispassionate outlook on most situations that came before him.My advice would be to go out and buy the book. You'll be far more entertained and won't have to spend $18 on something that's ""rental"" quality at best.","

"mighty_max","15 December 2006","Eragon is a great movie to relax and enjoy yourself. Don't look for any deep thoughts and/or hidden meanings. Just sit back and relax and you won't be disappointed. I really don't understand those who are complaining about acting since it was OK. Eragon is being played by young Ed Speleers, 18 yo who was chosen after extensive search organised by 20th Century Fox. Academy award winning actor Jeremy Irons plays Brom (disent performance), Academy award nominee John Malkovich plays evil king Galbatoriks (nice and convincing performance), BAFTA award winner Robert Carlyle plays sorcerer Durza (I have to say that he looked great as villain), Academy award nominee Djimon Hounsouplays played Adihad and finally Sienna Guillory looked great as Arja.I also think that casting Academy award winning actress Rachel Weisz as a voice of Saphira was producer's best move. Her voice gives Saphira a note of elegance and contributes to her royal attitude.All in all, movie is great for relaxing (if you don't expect new LOTR or something like that).","

He must learn to master his Jedi powers and so with the aid of Obi Wan, he sets out to do battle with the evil emperor and his minion Darth Vader...No.. wait... isn't that another movie? Will the next movie have yoda in it? Poorly crafted, poorly edited, poorly characterised.Couldn't tell the difference between an elf and dwarf, not that we actually had the time to see any.One of the worst films not only of this century, but last as well.Pathetic really, because it looked like with a better skilled director and someone other than a monkey on the editing, it could have been so much more.Did I add predictable? Haven't read the books, but I am willing to bet Jeremy Irons comes back from the grave.. after all the dragon sealed him hans solo style.Even a scene stolen director out of Star Wars... the one where Darth kills the old commander of the ship and promotes the next in command.Unoriginal and if Lucas doesn't sue, I am sure the makers of Dragonheart have a shot.In the end you are left asking why did I even bother.","

"turtlerock3","15 December 2006","This is a good movie if you just want to go see a movie with a cool dragon in it. However, if you go to see the book come to life, you will be extremely disappointed. The book I read has only the name in common with this movie. I realize that movies face time constraints that books don't have to worry about, but way too much is left out. The movie barely gets to 95 minutes, (which is the usual length of a Disney film), so there is no time for character development. Lord of the Rings proved that 3 hours is not too long for a film, and this film could have easily used the extra time to make the characters believable and likable. I sure hope Christopher has more control over any future movies. I would hate to have the same people get control over Eldest!","

"plallas","13 December 2006","I have been waiting for this film for quite a while and as many other fantasy films it has been such a big disappointment. Poor Paollini, I really feel for you. It must be really hard to see your brainchild been mutilated and butchered on the big screen. OK down to business. First of all there is absolutely no character development whatsoever. Get used to this comment guys and girls, you are going to hear it a lot about this movie. A HUGE part of the book is condensed to about half an hour towards the end of the movie. Major characters are only introduced by name, important events are skipped altogether and information that is absolutely necessary for someone to understand the movie is left out. Performances are decent and special effects are excellent but that does not change the fact that it all happens so fast and so clumsily that I was left watching the climatic battle at the end of the movie without knowing who are they fighting for. Oh one last thing. Have you ever seen an elf without pointy ears? Well if you watch this movie you will. Arya, the major elf character of the movie has NO pointy ears(at the end when she is saying her goodbyes to Eragon you can clearly see that her ears are very human)!!! Unbelievable, come on guys I cant believe that no one in production noticed that.","

"thatkid77","15 December 2006","OK, so i just got back from Eragon, it stunk!Eragon was trying to do a very cheesy English accent, while Durza, his face crumbling slowly tried to find eragon. if you read the books you will notice they left out Tierm, Katrina, the Raz-Ac shouldn't have died, Brom got killed by the Ra-Zac in the book...not Durza. Angela was supposed to be in the Varden as well, and to fight in the end battle, which looked like a mosh pit. The twins were not in the varden, murtagh was supposed to ""die"" and durza was supposed to die in a different way which is too long to type. Oh yes and when Eragon kills Durza, we are supposed to see some of Durza's past, and how he became a shade...and last but not least Eragon was supposed to bless a child, which fails terribly. Give the idea to Peter Jackson and he will do marvelous!!!","

"Scaith","12 December 2006","Saw this movie last night. My reenactment club was asked to provide some people in armour and to put on a fight before the movie. That part was fun and we got to see the movie as our fee.OK, firstly I went in to this movie cold. I didn't read any book or watch trailers. I had a peek at the stills from the movie on IMDb just before getting ready, to get some idea of what the armour and weapons were like so that I knew what to wear out of my own gear.I found the movie to be engaging. The special effects were relatively seamless and the acting of the lead was like someone who was rapidly thrown unknowing in to the deep end, just like his character in the movie, so that works. Brom and the king fitted their roles well as those two would be expected to.Having gone in cold to this world, I would have liked more background information as to what had gone before, but, in keeping with Eragon's character, we are left to find out the stories back ground at the same time as him.Though this movie is a little thin, I think that it is only the first installment and that the actors will grow in to their roles and that the story will be fleshed out.Taken as a one off movie, it's a fun watch, but it isn't great. If it is the start of a series of movies, it's a great start. I would suggest that people seeing this movie keep in mind that it is only the start of a story and support it so that the studio's don't drop any future parts. Now I'm going to search around and see if there are plans for followup movies. thanks all Derek","

"rinoa-heartilly","10 May 2007","When I heard a film version of one of my favourite books was coming out, I couldn't wait and eagerly waited for it's release - only to be disappointed when it was. The acting wasn't very good apart from Rachel Weisz as Saphira, the dialogue was bad, and the story was terrible. They changed too much from the book in my opinion and their order of things was appalling. A friend of mine who is also a big fan of the novels told me of a review which is actually quite suitable. I can't remember exactly what it was, but it said something along the lines of: 'It was as if the people who made the films read the first 10 pages and then made a film out of it.' I really wish they had left Paolini's book as a book instead of making it into a film. It really felt as if they were desperately trying to fit it into an 1hr 30mins time frame, and if they had expanded it to a longer film with more accurate copying from the novel, plus a better cast, it would have been a great film. It's a shame it wasn't.","

Eldest had read the book and preferred it for the detail but still thought the film was great. The lead was raw and young, the baddies scary as hell and the flying dragon scenes very well done - complaints about bad acting or scripts would have fallen on deaf ears for us. I enjoyed it too - it was no LOTR but still a decent piece of fantasy. It is rated PG and I think that tallies with the children who will want to go and see it - if you want adult fantasy there are plenty of films out there for you - this was great holiday entertainment for the kids who are already asking for it on DVD...","

The plot holes are laughable. The characters never fully developed. The story was as predictable as it can be. The experienced actors were wasted with bad lines and limited expositions. The central character need a real actor behind it. Eragon tried to be a Lord of the Ring clone, except the producers and the directors forgot how many hours Peter Jackson and his team put in on working the script. This isn't a movie that deserve its Chritmas slot. I hope the sequel never gets made.Save your money and get a burger or something. This movie is not worth the film it is shot on.","

In LOTR they did the best they could to get all the details right and not drift away from the original story, somethings were left out thou. In Eragon, not even the most crucial moments of the storyline in the book has been covered. And they have changed the story to fit their poor budget( a fantasy film in 1h 44min COME ON!). People that have read the book shouldn't see the film, you'll just get angry. And for the people that haven't, do it, and show the film to your children, because they might like it.

"zidane-16","16 December 2006","Okay, now we all know the book is absolutely amazing, and which was why 6 of my friends and I went to see Eragon the movie the night it came out. We were VERY disappointing. Overall, they skipped probably...what?...over 100 chapters? The battle scene was too short, not enough gore, and hardly any fighting. They left out too much, WAY too much. Believe me, save your money, see something else, because you can picture what's going on a lot better by reading the book, rather than going to see the movie. Another thing, what happened to the twins at Furthen Dur? They played a huge role, and where was Katrina? Anyhow, the movie pretty much went like this: start at chapter 1, skip about 10, then about 15 more...hm..that looks good, lets skip 20 more, okay, now 10 again, and oh look!...were at the end!..oh my, that was quick. Yah, good job directors. Lastly, I have two words that would have made this film the best of the year and probably would have won it a lot of awards: Peter Jackson. We all know he did Lord of the Rings, and if Eragon would have been directed by him, it would have been a lot better, it should have also been 3 hours long, for it would have taken it that much to cover book. That's it, can't wait to see the Eldest movie (kidding).","

"zardoz-13","31 December 2006","The story behind the sword & sorcery saga ""Eragon"" is far more interesting than the $100 million PG rated Twentieth Century Fox film release. Home schooled as a youth, Montana native Christopher Paolini began writing his 544 page epic at age 15. His parents and he privately published it when he turned 19 to retain all creative and financial power over it. In a Teenreads.Com interview, Paolini deflates his literary success, ""I never intended to become an author; writing ""Eragon"" was just a wild challenge for myself, an attempt to produce a book-length work, without any intention of publishing it. Of course, since it worked out so well, I've continued to pursue it."" Paolini's ultimate triumph with ""Eragon"" occurred through the intervention of another novelist's son. ""The most memorable event, though,"" Paolini says, ""has to be when Carl Hiaasen's stepson bought a copy of ""Eragon"" in Montana and loved it so much, Carl recommended it to an editor at Alfred A. Knopf. This one incident has completely changed my life."" Not only did Alfred Knopf publish the first entry in Paolini's trilogy in 2003, subtitled ""Inheritance,"" but also the publishing giant parlayed this capricious teen-oriented adventure fantasy into a bestseller. Later, in 2005, Knopf acquired Paolini's second installment in the trilogy, a vast 704 page tome, entitled ""Eldest,"" and published it. Not surprisingly, Philip Pullman, Mervyn Peake, J.R.R. Tolkien, Ann McCaffrey, E.R. Eddison, Garth Nix, and Octavia Butler figure among the writers who inspired Paolini. In a Powells.Com interview, Paolini defended fantasy as his choice of the subject matter: ""Life is a give and take between pain and pleasure, suffering and joy. Finding a way to live with dignity is one of the eternal themes of human existence, and . . . writing fantasy is a way to explore that. To try and share with the readers the solutions that you or I have happened to think of to some of those quandaries. It makes reading worthwhile, too.""No, I haven't read Paolini's sprawling novel, but I have seen visual effects-wizard-turned-film director Stefen Fangmeier's lackluster 140-minute adaptation starring newcomer Edward Speleers, Jeremy Irons, Robert Carlyle, Djimon Hounsou, and John Malkovich. Paolini should have credited George Lucas as another source of inspiration, too. The fifteen-year old hero, Eragon (Edward Speleers), lives on his uncle's farm in the mythical realm of Alagaesia, a kingdom once governed by the gallant Dragon Riders. Uncle Garrow (Alun Armstrong of ""The Mummy Returns"") is a single parent who raises his own son along with Eragon.Like Paolini's novel, Peter Buckman's screenplay constitutes an anthology of plot points and character archetypes from millennia of standard-issue mythology. For example, the prologue conjures up Tolkien parallels in its story about a larger-than-life struggle between good and evil and a dubious champion who will deliver all from the tyrannical despotism of its supernatural antagonist. John Malkovich of ""Dangerous Liaisons"" fame plays the insane King Galbatorix with ranting, scenery-chewing exuberance. Sadly, Malkovich's over-the-top villainy is confined to only a few scenes on a single throne set as he barks orders to his dastardly second-in-command, a shade called Durza. Once a noble dragon rider himself, Galbatorix rode the blue skies astride a fire-breathing flying lizard and maintained harmony throughout the empire. However, Galbatorix betrayed his brethren and slaughtered them. Miraculously, Brom (Jeremy Irons of ""Dungeons and Dragons"") survived Galbatorix's massacre. He serves as an Obi-Wan Kenobi type mentor for the unskilled teenage protagonist. The villains in ""Eragon,"" such as the Urgals and Ra'zacs, are the equivalent of the Orcs and Urk-hai in Tolkein's ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. Meanwhile, the sorcerer Durza (Robert Carlyle of ""Trainspotting"" fame decked out like Marilyn Manson) combines facets of Darth Vader from ""Star Wars"" and the draconian Saruman (Christopher Lee) from the ""LTOR"" trilogy.During a hunting trip, our naïve young hero stumbles upon a large dark blue stone about the size of a watermelon. Poor as he is, Eragon tries to exchange it for meat, but the village butcher refuses Eragon's offer. Later, to his surprise, Eragon discovers that the stone is really an egg. Before his eyes, he watches as an adorable baby blue dragon hatches from it. No ordinary young dragon itself, the playful lizard manages to communicate with Eragon through telepathy. Eragon comes to the attention of Brom, and they join forces to dethrone Galbatorix. Meanwhile, Galbatorix's murderous minions are scouring the countryside to find the egg before it hatches. Saphira, as the hatched dragon comes to be called, grows to adulthood in record time, towering 15 feet tall with a wingspan of approximately 30 feet. London-born actress Rachel Weisz of ""Constantine"" provides the Saphira's voice and brings some warmth to the beastie. Comparatively, ""Eragon"" recalls the 1996 fantasy film ""Dragonheart"" about the last dragon (voiced by Sean Connery) and a disheartened dragon-slaying knight (Dennis Quaid) that team up to topple an wicked monarch.Director Stefen Fangmeier and Buchman try to pile a plethora of plot information as well as magical hocus-pocus into this uneven hour and forty minute hokum. Unfortunately, everything comes out sounding either derivative or incoherent. Neither director nor writer does adequate job of giving the leading characters enough screen time and individuality to stand apart from each other. Similarly, the veteran supporting cast finds itself hampered by brevity from making a genuinely memorable impression. Pretty boy Edward Speleers proves that he has a lot to learn about acting before he can rival Mark Hamill in the role of a swashbuckling hero. The sole virtue of ""Eragon"" is Hugh Johnson's sweeping widescreen cinematography with its dizzying aerial footage of Hungary and Slovakia where the filmmakers lensed this hackneyed, superficial fantasy. Overall, the plot with all the usual clichés and conventions unfolds with a predictable, by-the-numbers familiarity that undercuts its sense of spontaneity.","

But I have seen this film (my niece is a HUGE fan of fantasy-adventure), and this film is an abomination of film-making. I don't care how fantastic the visual effects are, NOBODY CARES if you don't develop interesting characters, and 90 minutes is just enough time to make a slapstick comedy funny, but certainly not enough time to develop a 500+ fantasy book with an entire world of characters and story lines. This film is lazy, boring, and unimaginative. The cinematography is carbon-copied from the LOTR trilogy, Howard Shore should sue the film composer for plagiarism (except he did a poor job of it), and let's hope that Stefen Fangmeir decided to go back to what he know best - supervising visual effects - because he certainly can't supervise (i.e. direct) living, breathing human beings.

Instead the crew of the film produced a crude and very messed up version of the masterpiece. Humoring that a teenager could produce a better piece of work than the hooligans hired to adapt his book.The only thing the movie had going for it was the casting, not that all cast members did a good job on the acting, they(almost) looked the parts. The only real person that acted their part was Rachel Weisz as Saphira's voice. Djimon Hounsou wasn't given enough screen time and the character of Nasuada didn't even exist unless someone actually took time to read the credits. Angela's character was given two minutes as a background character and where in the world was Solembum? Special effects weren't anything to shake a leg at except for Saphira. The scene with the Battle Under Farthen Dur was a brief skirmish instead of the ""Helm's Deep"" of The Two Towers that it should have been. And what was up with the Urgals? They looked like steroid induced stunt men whereing makeup instead of the gruesome monsters they were.Like so many have said before me: skip it.

To many key parts were cut out,the ""Razack"" look like something out of a horror movie, the ""urgals"" just look like large men, i didn't even know there were dwarfs until someone told me; the twins, Solembum, and Katrina weren't even mentioned. It just wasn't done to it's full potential. I think it was lame and corny. ex: ""I'm a princess"", ""When will i see you again?"" And the ending was all wrong. It was just bad in my opinion. My suggestion is to just stick with the books, they are so much, well, more. More complex and the characters are more developed, and the story is fuller. There is more to it than the movie shows. I hope the Eragon is redone in the near future and is done better, and it would be great if the characters look how the are described in the book.For example Aray's looks don't fit her personality, which was also changed.","

And I can't believe I'm saying this, but I was kinda satisfied... O_o Yeah I was! lol. He should have been more in the movie, but it actually worked for me. The fact that he pops up now and then kept people interested and I could hear other people in the theater going all ""Hmmmm"" and ""oooh"" when he kept following Eragon. They kept the mysterious Murty if ya asked me. But he's still too different from the book for sure. But I think Garret did a great job. He's strange, but I like him. I like strange. I didn't like the scar though... I always imagined it a little bigger... and of course on the back. And it all went to fast... in the movie. And he kicked ass in the Varden =) I was sad not to see his horse Tornac though, but hey! He got Brom's pretty horse! I fit the horse! hehehe. I want piccies from those parts where they ride to Varden! Man I can go on forever... Where to start? Where to end? I think the acting was pretty good. Eragon, Ed Speelers did a pretty good job actually. Brom, for whatever reason reminded me of Jack Sparrow at time (Don't even ask), I liked Arya a lot although her role is way bigger then in the book and she takes Murty's spot! But It didn't really bug me as much as I would have thought. Murtagh is as I said, accepted. Bigger role would been even better.The music was okay, I love Avril's song! It's gorgeous, but they cut it down in the credits! Grrr! And I swear Garret's last name was HeLdlund... not Hedlund... haha ah well.Scenes I liked... Uhm... Murtagh popping up now and then! Wiihiii! There came a little ""Woop!"" from me when he first is seen in... Daret? And then when he aims his arrow towards Eragon and you don't really know if it's he he will shoot. I also loved all the riding in the landscapes parts. Beautiful! And they kept at least a little ""Eragon and Murtagh"" bonding in the movie, but sadly waaaaay too little. Lovely that Murty still saves his life. They're so cute. Should have been more scenes between them, but well I got the book! :P OOhhhh and the waking up scene at the end... *clutches heart* That was a sweet moment. But also the one right before where sad with Eragon and Saphira on the battle field. Oh! I loved most scenes with Saphira. Everyone went ""Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww"" in the theater. Everyone!!! At the baby Saphira. Man that was cute! I loved Rachel's voice! Brilliant! Anyway so to end it somewhere... I am tired now and it's in the middle of the night so I have probably messed up everything here and forgotten stuff :P But all in all. I love the movie - I love the book. They are like two different stories, but I love both. Minus for all the changes from the book (although they don't disappoint me as much as expected and as they do to others) and because of the shortness of the movie. Waaaaay way short! + for Saphira, Murtagh and just the fact that I wasn't as disappointed as I thought... Oh One last thing! You can't compare the story to LOTR! LOTR is unique... Eragon isn't as good (seen away from it being different from the book), but... I mean... What do I mean... haha... Just don't compare those two... as in how good they are (not the likeness) It's easy to impress me! =) And my best friend loved it too... We are SO going to the movies to see it again between Christmas eve and New Years Eve!","

"redsoxsweety","15 December 2006","I walked into the theatre with the highest expectations for this movie ever and was absolutely thrilled about being able to see it. But then I saw it and I wanted to cry! What was that!!! First off, I have read the book and am currently on the second because I absolutely LOVED it! But did the people who made this movie read it at all???? It defiantly didn't seem that way! They cut out WAY to many things and the only good special effect was the dragon Saphira but that was it! I am infuriated at this movie! OK first, Eragon isn't even 16 in the book, not 17 as it said in the movie, and he is supposed to be sleeping when the egg starts to hatch. What happened to Sloan's daughter who Roran loves and him going off to make a life for them not get away from the army? What happened to the child Eragon blessed which will be a big part in the 2ed book? What happened to the big saphire star thing Arya breaks?? And speaking of the end, Eragon does not fight the shade on the smoke dragon thing, but in that room place, plus the shade doesn't bring the army, and the shade slices Eragon on the back, then Saphira and Arya come to help, and what was with the sword? It looked plastic with a bit of red paint. Brom wasn't that mean in the book and he told Eragon about the dragons, and the farm is already burnt and what happened to Horst???? Eragon also brings Garrow back to be healed! The Ra'zac have beaks and cloaks! They don't look like half eaten bodies with bugs all over them, lord of the ring play-offs! Eragon and Murtagh were hot and good (everyone was good actors) but no one looked the part except them and Saphira! Where's Broms beard and what in the world did you do to Angela!!! She was so quirky and funny and fun, but the movie presented her as some weird Egyptian play-off person. What happened to the town with the people the urgals killed because that's where Eragon kills them with the arrows (the Urgals looked totally wrong as well) and what happened to the other town where Angela and Broms merchant friend are suppose to be at, and what happened to the werecat??? He was suppose to warn them when they are searching through the scrolls for the ra' zac which, by the way, is the whole reason Eragon and Brom set off in the first place, not to go to the Vardan which is what Brom is against! And Brom gets killed by the Ra'zac not the shade and that's where Eragon finds out Broms a rider. Not before! Broms life is a big secret not all laid out as it was in the movie! Also, they showed nothing of the practice Brom and Eragon did with swords, sticks, and magic and Eragon didn't seem to get tired from using magic as he should have. Plus, we didn't even basically see anything of the Varden which was something I was very much looking forward to, and what happened to Orik? He was nowhere, nor was the twins and Ajihad's daughter plays a big role in the seconded book, but you don't even know who she is in the movie. Also, Murtagh and Eragon were supposed to be good friends and Murtagh rescued Eragon and Arya from the prison ( Arya also was supposed to be unconscious during the whole ride to the Vardan!) and he was the one who shot the shade with an arrow, and his cut was supposed to be on his back, and he was supposed to be kept in a nice place at the Vardan and tell Eragon that he was Morzans son and fight and spar with Eragon! Plus they were suppose to take a long time to get to the Vardan and Murtagh is suppose to be against going to the Vardan the whole time! The shades eyes were supposed to be red, (even though he did look good,) and Aryas hair was supposed to be black, and wear black leather. Also, Angela is supposed to be at the Vardan when Eragon's there, and Eragon is supposed to be there for a while, not get there and then all of the sudden have to fight, and the Urgal's come up from the tunnels, not through the wall. And King Galbatorix isn't shown at all in the book, just talked about, but he is shown multiple times in the movie. I have MUCH more to say, but I fear it would take like a billion pages. Bottom line, read the book, don't see the movie.","

"pikaman2000","16 December 2006","I read the books, and i thought they were incredible, especially considering the inexperience of the author. The movie falls to the other end of the spectrum. You need to know the books to even make sense of the movie - the person who accompanied me spent the entire car ride to her house asking me what happened. Not only that, but it is a forced movie - everything happens too quickly. The only good thing was the four good performances, done my John Malkovich, Jeremy Irons, Eragon (cant remember his name) and Rachel weisz. They had sound performances, even though the screen writer should be torn limb from limb. ANother thing is how utterly cliché it was. They tried to make it a little heartfelt near the conclusion, but failed utterly. If you want to waste time and money, then go ahead and see this movie. If you want to be entertained, then watch the reactions of those walking out of the theater.","

"lilla_alv","17 December 2006","I finished the book this summer and when I read about a coming movie I began to count the days. How wrong I was.This movie is a disaster and I'm pretty sure that the one who made it hasn't read the same book as I. The book they have made the film of is one with maximum five pages and a lot of pretty pictures.After fifteen minutes they had jumped a lot of the story from the book and I feel like the movie wouldn't seem reasonable if I hadn't read it before. The characters are boring except from Robert Carlyle as Durza who in my opinion makes the movie watchable. John Malkowitch plays the same old way he Always do and no one of the others actors make me want to see what happens next. Everything that happens in it feels rushed and hasty. A LOT from the book has been removed (WHERE are Aryas EARS?! She is an elf for God's sake!) and the long bonding between Saphira and Eragon that I think is the center of the story is nowhere to be seen.I must agree to what others have written here, the movie oozes from Peter Jackson-wannabe syndrome. If you really want to experience something great with this, ignore the movie and go to the library!","

The movie in no way hold true to the book, nor the chronology of events nor the details of how things happened in the book. If this movie were made based on a book I had written, there would not be enough words in any language to describe how irate I would be over how poor of a job was done. I would not waste my time with this movie, especially after reading the book. Saphira was great in appearance and animation. The remainder of the cast left so much to be desired.

"fedor8","31 March 2010","Watching this unforgettable flick brought back so many memories. It was an experience worthy of a time-traveler.Once upon a time there lived a young boy by the name of Eragon Skywalker, also known to his friends as ""Tall Frodo"" and ""Blonde Harry"". At the same time, in a forest nearby, a young woman, Leia, was being chased by the tiny but infinitely evil Darth Saruman, a Scottish actor who works for Voldemoort. She had something very valuable in her possession, an object that could ruin all of the Emperor's plans: a blue egg called R2D2. This egg held the secret weapon that could wipe out Sauron's mighty Death Star: a small dragon with an annoying voice. It hadn't hatched yet - and no thanks to C3PO and his foolish antics! John Malkovich's Orcs had been very close to finding it, but Frodo Potter wasn't so blond that he couldn't hide a simple egg. The slightly effeminate but very evil Malkovich Vader would have to wait for a later chance to completely rule Middle Earth and the rest of the Galaxy far far away.Eventually, Blond Harry meets Obi-van Gandolfi (played with true conviction by a highly motivated and in-form Jeremy Irons), a former blue-dragon expert and telepath who commences the teachings of the Force to Froderagon. Harry Baggins doesn't heed the advice of the wise Jeremy Yoda, who warns him not to go to the Castle of Death Star, where the fair maiden Leia resides. ""Don't go, Aragorn! It's a trap!"". Even Leia, looking very pretty while shackled in a dungeon, warns Luke Potter that it's the kind of trap only a moron could fall into. But love is blind, as Yodandolf likes to always say, and Eragorn stumbles into the trap, only to end up facing his nemesis, McVoldevader...I won't tell you the rest, because honestly the movie is far too original, unpredictable, and inventive to ruin it all by including all of the spoilers in this humble little review. Just go see it. You won't regret it. Because what the author's fertile 15 year-old mind brings to us here is nothing short of magical. (There is a rumour that ""Eragon"" was really written by a 51 year-old plagiarist, but that just sounds too preposterous.) I can hardly wait for the sequels to this phenomenally successful blockbuster. In them we will find out whether Frodo, Luke and Harry will sue.May the Force of Easy Profit Through Copyright Infringement be with you.","

"Everchosen","17 December 2006","As I went to see Eragon, my expectations were very high, as I loved the book. The movie itself is action filled and well played (exept by Joss stone... which was just ridiculous)but something is missing. I think the directors made a bad choice to exclude some of the (I think) important factors in the book. Eragon's training, the Kull, Brom's death, the Dwarfs (Which were almost non-existent except for Hrothgar.... who was as tall as a human, and lastly the fight in Farthen Dûr. I had hoped for a more epic, battlefield-ly kind of battle, instead of the cramped scenes that were made. I had also hoped for a more intense fight between Brom and the Ra'zac, and Eragon and Durza in the heart of Farthen Dûr. I can only hope that the Ra'zac will have the role in Eldest that they do in the book. Regarless, the movie was good, the effects were beautiful (I admit, I had feared what the Urgals and Saphira would looked like :)) The film, sadly, looks like its been kinda rushed, and I think they should've taken the time to film at least half an hour more (the movie is at about 2 hours). Nonetheless, as a fan of Eragon, I enjoyed the movie, and I think that all fans should go see it, if not for the story, for the intense action :) Have fun!","

How we are supposed to believe this dragon can fly when she never moves her wings (well, 3 times, in the whole film) . . . is beyond tolerance.Jeremy Irons, who is a fine actor, gives you the feeling he is looking at his watch hoping it will all be over soon. The young male lead redefines the meaning of the word 'wimp.' I am embarrassed to admit I watched it through: I guess it was in order to see if there would be any relief from the gross incompetence; there was not.Patrick Watson Toronto","

"winner55","12 January 2008","Let's be honest - this film is true to its genre, and is relatively more interesting than many. It's not all that bad; the FX are good, the acting pretty good, the dialog cliché but acceptable. The pacing is also OK and all other aspects of the film are more than tolerably professional.The problem is, no matter what its professed source material (a fantasy novel with cult status) - the film is a less cohesive, less amusing, and strangely less humane, remake of ""Dragonheart"" - uncredited, of course. And let's also face this: although only slightly above the level of a B-Movie, Dragonheart is very entertaining, with characters we come to love (including the dragon) and a strong plot derived from the Arthurian sagas of the later Middle ages.If you're going to remake a film like Dragonheart - a top of the line B-Movie adventure story - you've got to bring something new to the table.Unfortunately, ""Eregon"" doesn't.","

"mentalcritic","19 April 2007","When I first heard of Eragon, I heard of it as a work of vanity publishing by a teenaged author who had copped way too much Star Wars. So when I saw that a film had been hastily made to cash in on the fantasy film trend that emerged in the wake of the disappointing Lord Of The Rings films, I decided I would wait for it to emerge on DVD. Having read some of the complaints by fans of the novel, I can say I am glad that I never read the novel. For even if you discount the myriad of cited differences between novel and film, Eragon just does not make a very good film or story at all. The irony here is that a few nights prior to viewing, I happened across a listing of science fiction clichés, many of which also apply to the fantasy genre. They were ranked by how tired they were, and the funny thing is that Eragon resorts to so many that simply do not work unless one uses their creative ability to put a unique spin on them. The problem here being that if uniqueness were money, Eragon could not afford to buy potatoes.The plot, such as it is, revolves around a land under the rule of a tyrannical empire. In ages past, the land was kept safe by a select group of mystics who had a unique ability to ride dragons. But one dragon rider turned against them and wiped almost all of them out. Whether the ability to ride dragons is heritable is not really explored in the film, but our central hero is among one of the few remaining. If you do not think this plot sounds familiar, that is because you were hiding under a rock during the years in which it was literally impossible to escape publicity for the Star Wars films. And that is only the most obvious example I could name. David Lynch's adaptation of Dune was doubtlessly seeing a lot of time on Peter Buchman's display unit, too. But as I said, reusing ideas that are now so old they are being taught in public schools is forgivable if one puts new and unique twists upon them. The problem in Eragon is that this iteration of the story does anything but.Another problem for the film is that the world depicted is very shallow at best, furthering the copycat feeling of the story. We know as much regarding the motives of every character at the end of the film as we did at the beginning. In some cases less. We are told that Robert Carlyle's character is a Shade, but without having seen these creatures in other films or roleplaying sourcebooks, one would be hard-pressed to understand exactly what this means. And to be quite honest, since these creatures are rarely used outside of a Dungeons & Dragons sourcebook, it was all too easy for the writer to change the character's abilities or weaknesses to suit the needs of the plot. Which is exactly what it feels like they did during every scene in the film. A Star Wars equivalent would be giving Darth Vader the ability to breathe without machine assistance for more than a handful of seconds because he needed to do this in order to kill the Emperor. It is lazy writing that makes one even more reluctant to bother with the novel. It is truly a credit to Robert Carlyle that the character has any menace to him at all.You will notice that I have yet to mention any of the heroes. That is because with the exception of Jeremy Irons trying to avoid comparisons to Alec Guiness, none of the heroes of this film are worthy of mention. The only one given enough development time to even resemble Luke Skywalker is the titular dragon rider, and I never thought I would hear myself say that the Luke Skywalker of A New Hope seems far more grown up. As with Carlyle, Eragon is given sudden and unexplained new abilities whenever the plot paints itself into a corner that it cannot escape without them. And this is probably the worst thing one can do in fantasy writing. Without a consistent set of rules to govern the world the characters inhabit, everything falls apart. A good ten minutes for someone to explain what the dragon riders can do and why would have anchored the plot a bit more firmly in the viewer's mind. The problem from the writers' point of view is that once they had done this, they would also be less free to change the rules at their leisure to suit the needs of their story.And with a cast of characters that nobody gives a damn about once the most charismatic or developed die, the whole thing falls down like a house of cards. Sienna Guillory and Edward Speleers are incapable of carrying a film on their own. Robert Carlyle could have carried the film if it had focused more on him, but that would have required a character as dynamic and well-written as Darth Vader, which Durza is anything but. John Malkovich looks truly bored to be playing Galbatorix, which I do not doubt he was given that he has previously appeared in films where people get sucked into a portal within his head. By comparison to other works Carlyle, Malkovich, and Irons appear in, Eragon is so pedestrian and lame that it is barely any wonder that even Carlyle occasionally appears to be phoning in his performance. The rest of the cast have not the skill nor the experience to see that they are fighting a terrible script, and thus they deliver earnest performances that are undercut at every second by the copycat script.I gave Eragon a rating of two. It is truly cash-in film-making at its worst. See it for an example of how trends can destroy innovation.","

"Flagrant-Baronessa","27 February 2007","The only way you could respond 'no' to the above is if you've never seen Star Wars. ""Eragon"", based upon the Christopher Paolini novel, begs the question of who greenlit this irrevocable dross. The story of a young dragonrider who has greatness thrust upon him in times of war hovers around iconic fantasy staples such as doomed mentors, fairy-tale princesses, the-uncle-who-is-soon-to-be-dead, rebel alliances and set-ups wholly 'borrowed' from the classics  and when you semi-plagiarize Star Wars, you are truly scraping the barrel. Director Stefen Fangmeier is a CGI-guru of sorts, but his special effects skills never translate onto this product, possibly because there is always too much of it occupying one frame, and naturally only the most eye-catching, flagrant dross is visible, and a potent example of CGI-gone-wrong is Saphira the dragon. There are numerous sweeping, epic, aerial shots of dramatic fantasy landscape, but most of it is far too artificial after it has been filtered through this CGI process and as a result the whole spectacle is noticeably less captivating. The rare, fleeting moments of suspense and poignancy that sweep you up in the film are found in the dragon flying sequences but even they are nothing to write home about.Not to generalize, but even as a fan of the genre I can say that fantasy rarely allows for subtlety. In ""Eragon"" this is unmistakably true. Expect no moral grey zones: here is altogether polarized black-and-white camps with golden-haired heroes and gruesome dark orc-like creatures in dungeons who randomly raid travelers. The one remotely layered character in the story is Jeremy Irons' doomed mentor role, but his fate is just as predictable as the others'. There is your usual stares-in-disbelief protagonist (Edward Speleers), the empowered-butt-kicking-yet-impossibly-womanly-and-fragile rebel warrior-princess, a well-oiled up specimen who finds herself in distress and lastly there are the unnecessarily sinister villain arcs. One of the best parts in the film that kept me going was the rotating scale of shitty acting. When Rachel Weisz first appeared I was convinced her annoyingly in-your-face cutesy attitude was the singular worst thing about the film, but just as I established this my outlook was floored by Sienna Guillory (who I know is at the mercy of an underwritten character, but still), who seemingly reached new levels of unique ham. Then, curiously enough, appeared Djmoun Hounsou who yet again upped the suck-o-meter in acting. This may be a positive feedback loop, for as ""Eragon"" progressed, new, more terrible performances surfaced. In this way, I could not stop watching. I was mesmerized.The PG-rating of the film should be a natural deterrent. It does not suggest that this movie is for kids as much as it suggests that it is not for adults. As such, it traffics in sentimental taglines such as ""without fear there cannot be courage"" and self-referential, recurring dialogue of wisdom. Stefen Fangmeier practices a kind of lead-footed direction here which stumbles along the silly storyline of learning from reluctant-yet-loving mentor, saving the damsel in distress and killing the bad guys, ultimately having fledged itself into the kind of incoherent fantasy outlet a teenager would resort to, sans delicate or layered elements. All good vs. evil.Finally, I will concede that ""Eragon"" does not fully violate code 01 of film-making: it is never boring. On the other hand, it is not exactly gloriously entertaining either (it never reaches the kind of so-bad-it's-good podium its bastard-cousin ""Dungeons and Dragons"" brushed upon) but the sheer scale of the fantasy medium and the brisk pace with which the story moves rarely allows watch-glances or anything of the sort. I can safely tell you that I would not sit through this experience again, however.4 out of 10","

The movie does not contain many details from the books, and a lot of the leading characters does not appear. Further more, the writers of the movie have chosen to shorten the book and rewrite a lot of the book's main story. THerefore a fan might leave the cinema furiously. But if you HAVEN'T read the book, and are longing to go and watch a movie filled with action, fantasy and fantastic creatures, this is one you shouldn't miss!!

"koriandr_star","16 December 2006","I have to say this was horrible and diabolical. Yes it's PG and from a kid's perspective they may enjoy it but you can save yourself time, misery and money in renting classic children/family adventures and purchase dark crystal, Dragonslayer or return to OZ, both well made, intelligent and original at the same time. These films will reward your child with creativity, Eragon doesn't.First off it's not the CGI that's the problem, the dragon and the magic were reasonable well done, no one could hope it would match LOTR standards but the story is empty of character and has no logic, if anything must show the flaw of the book as it is based on it after all.Edward Speleers does his best to play Eragon, in giving him a character but Eragon in the end is nothing more then a pitiful weak country boy with Hollywood styled hair and perfectly white teeth (remarkable considering there's no showers or dentist. The character is rushed a to b while incredibly mastering elvish magic that dragon riders (or he) can somehow suddenly master (It's only explained in two sentences) Which goes on to do healing and unlocking doors which makes you go 'eh?' the development of his character is wasted even more by a pointless five minute friendly fight with his cousin/brother Roran (I say brother/cousin because his relation is only mentioned once and he does nothing else then spar) apparently it's character excuse but in truth it was a cheap way to build emotional grief later on in that Roran has to leave and has to join the army (by force because you know the king wants conscripted recruits because it's...evil) And to add more not also is Roran never seen again but Eragon only has a two minute grief over his slained uncle and never talks about him or thinks of him throughout the film. His uncle is just forgotten.Jeremy Irons does well as brom, the slightly not quite there wise man who under no surprise was a former dragon rider, but the way he is to be in the film is flawed, he appears to be smart but has a smart alec go at the soldiers (who are in black to remind you their EVIL) who could and for some reason don't kill him yet tells eragon not to endanger himself?! And this character also amazingly jumps in to save Eragon from a blade, sacrificing himself, how he followed eragon so closely is never revealed.Arya is a horribly done character, a very typical 'I can fight but I'm a damsel overall and second best to my future husband, I mean ERAGON) while her appearance borders on literal sexual attraction to our hero. While John Malkovich as the 'evil king' was utterly laughable, he stays in one cold place uttering crap about why he should be feared (if he got out more or used that dragon of his at the final battle then just showing he had one then we could buy why he should be a bad guy.If you are looking for elves or dwarfs in the hero ranks then be disappointed, I mean even Arya is apparently an elf but there is no distinctive features of her. The Urgals are just bald big ex soccer hooligans in face paint. There is also a character called a-JIHAD (In caps just to show how lame it is, is it even meant to be an attempt of an Arabic name?) Robert Carlyle as Durza is the most illogical character and the plot hole itself, forget why both the good guys and the bad guys never organise themselves, forget why eragon's dragon thinks it's good to fly through a dense forest, forget that using magic to kill is wrong but incinerating an entire army is fine (does eragon even think Roran was in the invading forces that he destroyed? of course not! We're not to even think about it for their EVIL!) Forget why Durza never calls the local troops garrisoned at the eragon's home to go there and kill the boy, it would be quicker then sending in the 'ninja freaks' Forget it all and consider this. Durza is powerful and set things alight, wood, land, everything except...people? Why? that doesn't make sense, how can we not be set alight by his powers? He has telekinesis, fire, he's hard to killin fact WHY should he even take orders from his king? Why is he not the one in charge? When you realise that and the number of LOTR ripped off screen shots (that are too many to ignore) then you realise just how poor this film is and you'll come to note the other errors as well.Christopher Paolini surely cannot see this as good, for the good of his novel success he must stop the writers from making a sequel otherwise no one would read his books.","

"ExpendableMan","13 January 2007","Fantasy cinema is a very, very difficult genre to get right. For every Conan The Barbarian, there's a Hawk the Slayer. For every Princess Bride, there's a Red Sonja. And cliché though it may be, for Lord of the Rings, there's now an Eragon, an epic story about a young farm boy who becomes a dragon rider and battles an evil King that while diverting, is little more than a shallow enterprise that fulfills considerably less than it promises. Even if the dragon is kinda cool.The story revolves around the titular teenager (Ed Speelers), who one day finds a bizarre looking blue stone in the forest while hunting. Shortly after, with soldiers searching the land, our lad finds himself the centre of a quest to save the world from the clutches of the evil king (John Malkovich) when the stone turns out to be an egg and he is given the unenviable task of becoming the latest in the illustrious line of now dead warriors known as the Jedi. Sorry, Dragon Riders. Cue chases through forest, over mountains and all sorts of New Zealand scenery that looks suitably dramatic when filmed from a helicopter as he hurtles headlong towards a final climactic battle.The chief problem Eragon has however is that much of the film feels like a collage of elements from other movies. Jeremy Irons for all his attempts cannot help but rip off Obi Wan Kenobi so much you half expect him to tell Eragon that the King betrayed and murdered his father at any second. Robert Carlyle meanwhile is obviously having an absolute blast camping it up as an evil sorcerer, but looks so much like Worm Tongue from The Two Towers that it's impossible to accept him as any more than a retread. Ally this to the formulaic plot and the dismissal of the film as 'Lord of the Cheese' seems all too accurate.Central to the cheese factor is lead actor Ed Speelers. To be fair to him, it's his first ever movie role and being cast as the centrepiece of a massively hyped blockbuster had to be incredibly daunting so I almost feel guilty to say that he just isn't very good. Eragon the character is just like Anakin Skywalker, it's very difficult to take a chosen warrior seriously when he acts like a stroppy teenager and considering his only experience of fighting is playing with sticks with his brother, his reckless enthusiasm for battling the King's hordes of axe flailing savages makes you doubt the logic behind making him General of an entire army. On a slightly minor but also incredibly irritating point, despite getting into fights, breaking into prisons and being involved in a massive mid air battle at the movie's climax that leaves him utterly drained, his hair looks perfect all the time.That little rant aside, the general impression you're most likely to have of Eragon is that it would have probably been a much better movie if they'd increased the running time a little. Eragon and Brom (the aforementioned Jeremy Irons) are both afforded plenty of characterisation as does Saphira, the Dragon who sounds like Rachel Weiz, but everyone else is merely there to fill in the blanks. Sienna Guillory is only there to provide Eragon with somebody to rescue and given that they hardly speak, their tearful farewell at the end seems completely forced. Garret Hedlund's Murtagh meanwhile has the potential to be one of the most interesting characters given his back-story, but instead is used only as a mysterious warrior who can get Eragon out of a few tight situations. Djimon Hounsou is similarly wasted, the normally reliable actor turning up at the end dressed in a very silly outfit then doing next to nothing except shout orders.Admittedly, it's not all bad. Rachel Weiz remains as bubbly and lovable as ever despite only doing voice work and there is a bit of fun to be had thanks to the high level of camp. Furthermore, the one major battle scene is also very enjoyable even if it is a bit short and should anyone out there be wondering what would happen if the Taliban came to blows with the Uruk Hai they need look no further. And without meaning to give too much away, the cliff hanger ending is really very good, even if you do see it coming a mile away.This isn't enough to raise Eragon's level anywhere above the category of Must Try Harder sadly. It rips off too much from other movies and is far too contrived to stand on its own toes. If Lord of the Rings was a three course banquet, Eragon is a single course taken from a fast food restaurant's kids menu. Hopefully it'll pick up steam by the time the sequel surfaces.","

"jen_ro_hea1","25 December 2006","Personally I thought the special effects were pretty good, and how they made the dragon was cool. That and the people who played Saphira and Brom were really good. Other than that I think that the movie was pretty bad because the filmmakers did not do the people right, such as Arya; she should have had black hair, and where were the two bald men? So characters were missing from the movie, and so were a lot of the main events. Such as Eragon learning to read, the were cat, talking with the dwarf king, the oil spilling on the Urgals in the last battle, the pile of bodies in the one town, training on the field while in the Varden, the pain Eragon went through with Durza'a wound and the elf, and Eragon talking to Brom and learning about dragons. A lot of the events were also messed up, Eragon was supposed to ask Saphira which names she liked, the battle with Durza, Eragon getting hurt and staying in town and then running off and gathering supplies. The costumes were also off; Arya was supposed to have black hair and pointed ears, Durza was supposed to have maroon eyes, the Urgals needed horns, the Raazacs were supposed to have beaks and big capes and they were supposed to ride the evil horses. I could go on and on, but I will end by saying that this movie NEEDS Desperately to be REMADE with people who actually know about the book. And it wouldn't be hard because the movie would probably end up being the length of one of the Lord of the Rings movies (which I think is fun because you can really get into the movie).","

"ProudSonOfNewJersey","2 June 2009","The only reason that I gave it 8 out of 10 was the ending. It was only after turning to IMDb that I found out the movie was based on a book series. I can only hope there will be a sequel so that I can see how it ends. It seems that most folks don't like the movie because it wasn't faithful to the book. That happens a lot. I read John Grisham's ""A Time to Kill"", and got sick when the movie came out. So, I can relate to the book fans, but on its own, I just loved the movie. Amazing scenery, good fight scenes, real good special effects, a classic good vs evil theme, an evil wizard...jeez, who could ask for more? I guess I'm not as astute as some of the other reviewers, as I didn't notice any bad acting. I was totally wrapped up in the movie. Now I'm inspired to read the book series.","

"pixie_rains","31 December 2007","This movie was amazing! My little nieces absolutely loved it. The acting was excellent. the visual effects were great. I am really excited to see part 2 of this movie hopefully they complete filming it as soon as possible. For those that don't appreciate the movie more then likely it is because you read the book. You need to learn that not all detail can be put into the time frame of a movie a book will always be filled with more. So just watch the movie and appreciate the effort by everyone involved making the novel into a film for you. I certainly enjoyed it and I hope all that watch it in the future keep an open mind so they can enjoy it as well.","

"the_iguana_ate_my_socks","17 December 2006","I read Eragon, and rather enjoyed it. It is, however, a pretty typical fantasy novel, with a lot of clichés, and seems to draw a little too much in the way of influence from Lord of the Rings. I went to see the movie just for the heck of it, expecting a mediocre show. Nothing of the sort was presented. You can't condense five hundred pages into one hour and forty five minutes and expect greatness, it just doesn't work like that. Eragon, who was a rather dull, typical character in the book, gets any semblance of life sucked out of him. Arya's entire attitude changes in the movie, and you don't really get enough time to care about any of the characters. When Brom died in the book, I was sad, but in the movie, I honestly didn't care, because you don't get a chance to like or dislike him. The dramatic revealing of Murtagh as Morzan's son has quite the opposite effect that it does in the book, revealed more as an interesting tidbit than anything terribly important. Also, things have been changed drastically for the sake of drama, it seems, including some truly gag-worthy dialog. I would keep a safe distance from this movie if you value the book in the least.","

"herospaz","16 December 2006","I am a person who has read Eragon 3 times and knows the story pretty well, but you didn't even have to read it once to tell that they butchered it. That may seem a little strong to you, but I don't even think that they read the book. They didn't include any of the cities Eragon and Brom went to, nor did they show Eragon practicing magic or swordplay with Brom. By trying to cram everything in from a 500 page book to a 100 minute movie was impossible and they shouldn't even have tried. They changed the story around so much because they were trying to fit in into the time, but different people did different thing and the even changed what the Ra'zac looked like. And what was up with them killing the Ra'zac? What's going to happen in the second movie? They didn't even give Arya pointed ears!!! Yet that was the simplest thing they could have done. Oh yes, and Saphira just grew immensely in one flight that in the book took about a month. I'm sorry, but I expected this movie to disappointing, but not this bad.","

"kittenh","6 February 2007","First of all, the plot was poorly put together and just straight up sucked. It was terribly unoriginal; a poor boy finds something amazing and turns into a great warrior.. blah blah. We've seen it a hundred times. Perhaps it's my imagination, but doesn't it remind you of ""Willow""?(that movie about a midget who finds a baby) or LOTR(witch was good, but my point is it also is about a small dude who finds a ring of power)? Basically, the plot was unoriginal and stupid.Second, the duologue was just cheesy. I'm talking gooey nacho cheese melting all over the movie. Enough said. I gotta go get some of that cheese..yummy...Third, there was ABSOLUTELY NO CHARACTER DEVELOPENT. OK, suddenly we gotta go save a princess? And when we do she's suddenly a good friend of ""our"" hero? Then when that guy dies, I forgot his name(hehe) it's like, ""um, who cares?"" you never get to know any of the characters. That said, you can't feel anything for them when they are hurt or die.I may not be a fan of fantasy movies, but believe me, I know a pile of fantastic crap when I see it.","

"elranis","7 January 2007","As a film, it's not the worst thing I've seen. But it's not Eragon. 1)Arya looked like a real bitch (she had loved one of those elfs who were killed in the beginning BUT she flirted with Eragon) 2)She was blond, no pointed ears etc. 3)Eragon was too wise (in the book he had problems everywhere) 4)What happened to Horst? 5)Sloan was too nice person. 6)No insect would live on Razac! 7)Saphira was a mutant(she increased 5 meters in 5 minutes. Too fast) 8)Urgals were a race, not some kind of dirty humans 9)Gedwey ignaesia was weird. 10)Where was Yazuac? 11)Angela was a Character, not just a fortuneteller 12)Where was Solembum? 13)Where was Teirm? 14)Murtagh acted like a thief. 15)Brom's death was so pathetic 16)Durza did everything with his nails. 17)Saphira didn't know that she was able to transform stone into glass 18)Farthen Dur was weird 19)Struggle between Durza and Eragon was very different from this in the book 20)and so on... We have democracy in our family. 2 of us said ""9 points"" two of us said ""2 points"" That's why I give an average:5 points","

"ajaws4ever","14 December 2006","The book of Eragon was excellent (at least until it got like halfway into the book), but the movie was such a disappointment.Eragon stars Edward Speleers, Jeremy Irons (The Lion King (the voice of Scar), Die Hard: With a Vengeance, Reversal of Fortune), Sienna Guillory (Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Love Actually, Inkheart (filming)), Robert Carlyle (Dead Fish, The Mighty Celt), John Malkovich (Ripley's Game, The Libertine), and Garrett Hedlund (Four Brothers, Friday Night Lights).Okay, the only reason I gave this movie a 5 and not a 2 was because of the awesome special effects!Eragon. A film that is loaded with absolutely stunning special effects, although a couple that just made you roll your eyes. Edward Speleers was okay. He didn't really know how to really, oh, what's the word, um...act very good, or impress the audience. Everyone also was either okay at acting or really sucked at it.The special effects were absolutely stunning. Saphira the dragon looked so real! The filmmakers did Saphira so well that they actually made it seem like Saphira actually existed! And her voice wasn't quite what I had expected, but it was still awesome...it fitted Saphira's character so well. But, Saphira seemed to be the only thing the filmmakers focused on. All of the other special effects made me roll my eyes or made me sigh heavily.If the movie would have been exactly like the book, it would have been totally amazing. It would have been so much better than what it is now. Hopefully Eldest won't be such a brutal disappointment as Eragon is. Why is it that all of the great books turn into horrible movies? The only good books that turn into good movies are Harry Potter, A Series of Unfortuante of Events, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars. Like I said, hopefully the Eldest movie won't be as disappointing, because the Eldest book was so much better and amazing than the Eragon book.The movie may be a PG, but it's pretty violent. It's almost as violent as the book! It's like one millimeter away from being a PG-13. Even The Chronicles of Narnia was going to be a PG-13, but the filmmakers cut some stuff out of there that would've been to violent for younger children who loved the tale and the movie.Violence/Gore: 8/10 (strong for a PG), Sex/Nudity: 1/10, Profanity: 1/10, Drugs/Alcohol: 0/10Original MPAA rating: PG: Fantasy Violence, Intense Battle Sequences, and Some Frightening ImagesMy MPAA rating: PG-13: Fantasy Violence, Intense Battle Sequences, and Some Frightening Images and MomentsMy Canadian rating: PG or 14A: Violence, Frightening Scenes","

"perelandra-2","15 December 2006","If you think you are going to watch a movie that can be compared to LOTR or Narnia you will certainly get disappointed. If you go without any expectations you might just enjoy watching and that is it.What I mean is that for an epic like this, the movie watered down almost everything, and I wonder what the director had in mind. A quick box office success maybe? Well, in that case they should have done there work better than this.At the end of the movie I still had no idea about the characters, who they were, where they came from and what their meaning was in the whole story.Some parts of the movie look very suspiciously like scenes from LOTR, and I could hardly get exited at all. Remembering when I left the cinema after I watched the Fellowship of the Ring the first time.... wow, I wanted to enter the theater again right away (which I actually did). In this case I don't even expect an Eragon2....Special effects and music were lousy.Nevertheless, I did enjoy watching the movie. The dragon was the best of all, and the costume designers did a great job. Enjoy it for what it is, a nice fantasy to escape from the real world for 90 minutes. Just don't buy to much popcorn, you hardly have time to enjoy it.","

"alienbat","14 December 2006","If you're expecting a movie similar to the great ""The Lord of The Rings"" Trilogy, don't count on Eragon.Yes, it is going to be a trilogy (at least it's planed to be), and you will sure see many elements very similar to those appeared in the ""Ring"" Trilogy: elves, dark minions, shadow-like creatures mimicking Ring Wrath, orcs, dragons... But those won't make Eragon another legend like Ring Trilogy, not even close. They are all poorly designed without aesthetics and a feeling of reality. If you want to see some dragon-flying shot, Erogon do has plenty, but there won't be any surprises. You may possibly already seen such shot in Harry Potter 4. And that blue dragon in Eragon looked especially fake when it talks without moving it's mouth. (""Telepathy"" it is claimed to be, but I think it's the studio without having sufficient tech power to do it)The opening of the film is another simulation of The Fellowship of The Ring, with a speaker telling the background story. But it's just hollow, talking pure cliché with nothing mythic, although the speaker tries to use a mythic tongue and a lot of mythic words.The story? I didn't click the ""spoiler"" tag because there's just no much story to spoil. A farmer kid suddenly gets something powerful and he becomes powerful and he goes save the world, probably meeting some charming lady...sounds familiar isn't it? And hey! That world-saving boy just grows faster than you imagine -- 10 minutes ago he knows nothing but farming, 10 minutes after he's casting fire arrow and blasting a dozen of orcs all over the place. It's just fake.Conclusion: it's a pure waste of money for who makes it. And it's probably a waste of money if you go cinema for it. To be fair, I have to say: Eragon could have become some fast-food film that gives you some visual stimulation and you forget it when you step out the cinema. But with The Lord of The Rings trilogy already there, not even this is going to happen.","

"powerfull_jedi","16 December 2006","I've been waiting a full year for this movie, I've just returned from the theater sorely disappointed. As someone who read the book almost 2 years ago, the movie adaptation of Paolini's first book from the Inheritance Trilogy, Eragon, comes off as a mindless and random fantasy film that seems to have no identity of it's own, merely copying elements from the most famous of fantasy movies, Star Wars. For those who've read said book, the movie looks like it was adapting a junior novel rather then a serious book, the dialog shows it and do does the acting. The main story is pretty much there,in a world ruled by an evil king who has eradicated all the dragon knights/riders, hunter/farm boy Eragon finds a mysterious stone in the dangerous region's of The Spine, only to find out that it's a dragon's egg, upon hatching the infant dragon chooses Eragon as his rider and soon he discovers that he has the power to change the fate of Alagasea. Seems pretty good and I'll admit the movie starts off pretty well by recreating the scene from the book, but after that you'll start to get shocked on how they managed to screw up an interesting novel. I admit I though the movie was going to something special(judging by the trailers), one recent glance at the IMDb however left me somewhat preoccupied when I read the movie was roughly 100 minutes long, then I started seeing some clips from the movie courtesy of RopesofSilicon, one particular scene looked corny, today when I actually saw it, what a disappointment. Key parts(and characters) of the book are nowhere to be found(village destroyed by Urgals thus causing Eragon to hate them, re-encounter with the sorceress Angela, visiting an old friend of Brom, crossing a major river,Roran's proposal to the butcher's daughter, running away from bandits, crossing the desert, Arya fighting Eragon,etc), some events were changed(Eragon and Brom stalking the Razac, not the other way around, Brom reveals that he's a Dragon Rider in his deathbed,not before, the ending is also entirely different) leaving Eragon one big mess of a film, that's way to short to be convincing even by fantasy standards. Nobody will be convinced at Eragon's transformation into a Dragon Rider, let alone a decent swordsman(apparently killing off the Razac without much trouble, which will affect the outcome of the second and third movies), in this movie and part of the blame lands Ed Speelers, Stefen Fangmeier trying to pull an unknown-actor that unlike others in similar roles(Hayden Christensen, Brandon Routh and Mark Hammil) lacks charisma and talent, making Eragon a cool-looking pretty boy(and a babe-magnet as it seems that Arya looks like she's falling in love with the hero, something unimaginable to who's currently reading the novels, I also wonder did the writers also forgot she was an elf?) rather then the troubled but brave fighter in the book. John Malkovich does very little in the film, other then being the main villain who doesn't even show up in the book(but mentioned), Robert Carlyle does a good job as playing the villain Durza, but the only one who truly shines and seems to be having fun in his role is Jeremy Irons who plays Obi-wan... I mean Brom, Eragon's guardian and the village storyteller/hobo who's actually a dragon rider. The actor who plays Roran, is only there for a couple of minutes only to be completely tossed aside and never to be mentioned again(I wonder how this will play out if they decide to make a second film based on the second book). Rachel Weiz also provides the voice I was expecting and imagined for Saphira. The soundtrack is also good, but a little generic, but the special effects are top-notch, the dragon is truly believable and the Razac seem even more gross then described on the book. Again like I said before, the movie is way too short, too short to even make the characters believable and the plot convincing with very little build-up, the only build-up was the Brom/Eragon relationship which despite not being as largely explored as the novel, is somewhat convincing and Eragon/Saphira, Eragon's bond with Arya and Murtagh, however, is way too fast,it doesn't feel like an epic movie at all(curiously Chronicles of Narnia: LWW is a short novel and a lot of elements are very vague yet Andrew Adams turned it into a Lord of The Rings-like epic, Stefen Fangmeier does the exact same opposite with a lengthy book which features a lot of details). Another major disappointment is the portrayal of the world of Alagasea, we get a couple of villages, one fortress, the interior of what I think it's a throne-room, the Varden's hideout and lots of forest, not a single sight of the greatly detailed cities that abound in the book, just endless forests and hills, sometimes copying similar scenes from the Lord of The Rings movie series. In the end, even for fans of the book, the movie is not worth full price, everybody else wait for the DVD release.","

"editor-299","13 December 2006","I'll get this off my chest immediately; I am not a big fan of these fantasy/dragon movies. ""Dragon Heart,"" ""Dragon's Liar,"" ""Dragon Blade,"" ""Dragonslayer,"" ""Dragonfly,"" ""Pete's Dragon,"" you name it, I can live without them. In fact, as far as mythological beasts are concerned, I'm more intrigued with the griffin than I am with the dragon. However, since this newest release is not about a griffin, I had to sit through something I was not wild about to begin with. In an attempt to be another franchise fantasy bonanza, like ""The Lord of the Rings,"" ""Eragon"" (from the ""Inheritance"" trilogy  whatever that is) was launched. And just because the books were written by a teenager doesn't mean they are good. In fact, it means just the opposite.Sure, the kid, Christopher Paolina (now 23), was just 15 when he began the series, and certain license should be given for youth; but age is no discretion when it comes to larceny. After all, look at the boyish-faced group of Fagen's artful dodgers if you don't believe me.""Eragon"" steals frequently and unabashedly during its rather sparse 1 hour 40 minute lifetime; pickpocketing ""The Neverending Story,"" ""Excalibur,"" ""The Princess Bride,"" ""Braveheart"" and many of the aforementioned dragon flicks.Heck, the title is even a bastardization of a leading character in LOTR. Still, the set location is beautiful (New Zealand, where else?), and the special effects are competently created.Plus, the acting pedigree, especially from Oscar winners Jeremy Irons (""Reversal of Fortune"") as the mentor and former dragon-rider, Brom; and Rachel Weisz (""The Constant Gardner"") as the voice of the beast, Saphira, puts this a notch about the usual fantasy dreck. Add to this the interesting villains, evil King Galbitorix (John Malkovich) and his despicable sorcerer, Durza (Robert Carlyle, ""The Full Monty""), and the film is not all that bad.Not that I would ever pay to see it mind you, but it does have it's good moments; the least of which is its obvious setup for the upcoming sequel, due out next year (if this installment takes off).","

"egorho","16 December 2006","My 13 year old son read the book a couple of years ago. He loved it so when they announced that a movie was due out we where both anxious to see. First he says the movie isn't true to the book in some scenes but that it was still a great movie. He loved it and so did I.The newcomer who plays Eragon does a great job in his first movie role. He was believable and he acted the part like a seasoned actor. Of course, Jeremy Irons is ALWAYS good in any movie he is in and this is no different.The storyline progress very good and there are no dull parts. My only question is how this movie EVER got a PG rating. The look of the creatures is enough to get it to a PG-13. There was a parent there with 2 small children (approx. 4-6 yrs.old) and it was too much for one of them. In addition, the crudeness and killings make this more of a teenage movie, borderline adult. So if you go, just think if you want a kid under 10 maybe to see this. Dragons, torture, blood, fighting are all here. But every teenage boy will LOVE this movie. The girls should too. Great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Go see it and read the second book Eldest. I feel a sequel coming on.","

"LordJiggy","16 December 2006","This film is barely worth matinée price. My 12 year old son, not the most discriminating audience, enjoyed it. Parts of it were diverting, but mostly it was an exercise in tedium. It began to be fun seeing all the places the director proved how clueless he was. Bad cuts, wretched pacing and a complete lack of how to build emotion in a scene. The lead actor, young Edward, might have been good with a decent director, even a hack like Ted Kotcheff would have put together something at least competent. Here are the spoilers: Jeremy Irons and Robert Caryle are in a different movie altogether. Every time they're on the screen, however briefly, it feels like a real film, and hope is renewed. Then, they're whisked away by some shabby rip off from LOTRs, and you're left bereft. Sorry, I wanted to like this, or at least, enjoy it.","

"Juni78ukr","31 December 2006","Actually I saw Eragon at some kind of press screening about two weeks ago but only today I got enough time for writing some brief comments.I've read Christopher Paolini's book (both of them to be precise) about a month before and to say the truth I wasn't impressed at all. So it's easy to understand that my anticipations weren't sky high although some moments from numerous trailers and clips have drowned my attention. Besides not being a fantasy fan I'm usually quite tolerable to this genre.The only reason that I wasn't particularly disappointed leaving the movie theater were my low expectations. Anyone who expects something more than mediocre fantasy movie or something fresh and original will be clearly disappointed with Eragon. Obviously the biggest desire of the filmmakers was to make the movie as short as it possible. It was a stupid idea. They succeeded in that goal and for the most parts all what is happening on screen looks chaotic and very often illogical. What is more the entire story line of the movie can cause numerous questions and even incomprehension from all viewers who are not familiar with Paolini's book (whether you like it or not). Too many parts of the book were skipped or completely modified. Some fantasy world we know almost nothing about, dragon riders, evil creatures, the tyrant and rebels  all of that is too unclear and undisclosed and besides many of us will find that they have already seen that kind of story several times before. The director also failed in his attempts to impress the audience, make us feel involved in the events on screen. It's just emotionally cold movie with uninteresting poorly developed characters and pathetic villains, who are even more cartoonish and sketchy. What is even worse than that dialogs in the movie seems to be written by a twelve years old. It was so pathetic. The final battle is just a conglomeration of poorly united single scenes without much sense.Now, about what is not so bad. I'm not going to blame Edmund Speelers in anything. He wasn't that bad, although his incapacity to carry the movie on his own is evident to anyone. There is nothing to blame in the supporting actors. They did their job relatively well and the real problem is not in them, it's the imperfection and poor development of their characters. From technical point of view Eragon looks much better. Despite all the fears the dragon looks pretty good. It obviously that the masters of visuals tried to do their best and they are mostly succeeded there. The flying beast was really good and looked quite real both in relative immobility and in flight. Some of the flight scenes became the most impressive in the whole movie. The filming locations are well selected and the scenery is breathtaking. It proves that you don't always have to cross half the world to find good locations for filming.The best grade I can give Eragon is 5 out of 10 and I know that I'm probably too generous here. Thanks for reading.","

"hubert6188-1","20 December 2006","I watched it at the weekend and it was totally different from the book and the storyline was not the same as the book. Actors were okay, but the story was dull, boring and did not make me want to watch it ever again. I was getting excited when I heard it was being made into a movie, but was severely disappointed with the movie as it was really bad and left a bad taste. I seriously hope that the producers for the next film consider following the storyline a bit more and make it more interesting and stimulating for movie-goers. I won't recommend this movie to my friends, definitely. Although it was all hype before the actual release, I don't think many people actually felt the hype after watching the movie itself.","

I am really looking forward to see the 2nd part(maybe there will be even third,of course, that will depend on the second part, though).

"aokichan","16 December 2006","I will up front say I have not read the books. So I know right there I'm going to get a lot of sneers and boos for not reading them. In all actuality the movie has driven me to want to read the books.Any how to the point. I really loved this film, it was visually beautiful and not over done with special effects. The acting wasn't outstanding, but it was good. Funny to say not much better if not worse than the latest Star Wars movies. The story I felt was rather rushed in the beginning. And it holds a similar theme to the classic ""farm boy thrust into chaos being the chosen one etc."" Personally I think it's a nod off the the classics, not some cheap cop off.The story was wonderful, and I'm sure the novel is even more brilliant and vibrant with getting into the intricacies of it all as books usually are. I do think they could have played out the beginning a bit longer, helping the audience to feel more like things have been going on for some time rather than BOOM stuff happens.I loved the effects and Saphira was gorgeous, she really did seem believable and real, like her own species, Dragon. Eragon's character was well done, though I'm sure in the novel once again it's much more elaborate. One thing that did bug me was that his wardrobe was awfully nice for being a mere farm boy. That leather?! The evil king, cant recall his name, actually a lot of the names I have trouble recalling they're not very memorization friendly, with the exception of Eragon and Saphira, just didn't seem evil enough. His acting was like Haden playing Anakin, but so much worse.I guess you could call this a spoiler but to those who've read the novel it's no surprise at all. When Saphira ""dies"" I personally was quite moved, it was a powerful scene and for me I really could feel there was a strong bond between Eragon and Saphira. Hell I even cried.The battle near the end was most stunning, and the visual effects helped more than hindered. I really loved this movie. I do however agree even though I've not read the novel yet they could have done more with it. I mean really? How many novel based movies can you say stick to their guns and do full justice? Honestly if it were me choosing the director, I'd pick Peter Jackson, he's a man who's shown us he knows how to stay true to the novel. It just takes a good director and a good budget and someone who's willing to stay true to the books. Not many do that. For what it is Eragon, the film is beautiful and deserves to be respected in its format. Another word on the director, I looked up his page on the site, and he appears he did a lot in the special effects department, so that explains a good bit why the story was lacking. The movie industry these days are so much on visuals and unfortunately sometimes and many times lacking in story. Eragon the novel, alone possesses much praise and adoration and that's what we will always go back to regardless of the film.So if you're a fan, you go see Eragon, I'm positive you wont be crazy about it but at least do appreciate it for what it is. There's a ton people put into movies like this, from story boarding, to scripting, to making the sets, costuming and filming etc.","

"mike-mcintire","11 August 2007","Skip it. I can usually separate a movie from a book, say like Harry Potter, Clear and Present Danger, etc. But this one was TERRIBLE! It was so short, and clearly planning for another movie, that they surely could have stuck to the book's storyline a lot closer. It even appears that the entire budget was spent on Saphira to the extent of the Urgals were just grunting humans without horns. Where were the twins? The Ra'zac were killed. The list goes on and on.They got MAJOR points wrong, that make a HUGE difference. Artistic license is one thing, complete plot changes is another.Just read the book, its good and quick. Forget the movie. It's not even worth watching before you've read the book as you'll have some plot spoiled by what is left of the story line.","

"parufo2","22 December 2006","This was a great book, I even read it again just before I went to see the movie and what a let down. When will these people get it that it's ""the story dummy"" that we like. Not just the effects. This was a great story that was slaughered. And most of the people in the theater where I was at did not like it either (easy to tell with the comments they were making during the show). This could of been a great movie that I would have seen with my kids several times and bought when it came out on DVD. Now, you can keep it. It is really sad these morons that where the suits had to destroy another good story and in the long run it costs them money and us good entertainment.","

"edwardmoate","23 December 2006","I really loved this movie! The best thing about it is the story. I read the book and loved it too. In my opinion I think everyone is being way too unimagative in watching the movie. What especially caught my attention was the battles and content because i think they just made a PG rating. I really did not like the killing of the ra'zac unlike the book. And Saphira looked great and so did the other special effects. What i loved was the great end battle between Durza and Eragon. So i suggest u go and pay full price at the theaters and give the filmmakers a break for there job. In the end, the film was just right for me and didn't need anymore story. I hope they make a movie of Eldest.","

"georgebush","6 January 2007","Eragon is pure adventure. It is probably much better if you have not read the book. This makers did not spend 2 years and a huge budget and try and make a perfect replica. What they did do was make an excellent film that is exciting. Good and evil are clear here. Themes such as bravery, loyalty, truth, courage, cowardice and justice are weaved into the adventure.Ihave heard complaints that the main character is blond. Big deal. Why would such a thing bother people. Is there some other problem here. So i would not take seriously the comments of reviewers who make comments like that.Another person comments that he made loud laughs through the movie to show everyone in the theater how much he did not like the film. Wow. Do we really need to hear protest during movies when we pay 10 dollars? The film was fine. It reminded me of an old film called the Magic Sword. This is a great message of heroism for young and old alike. The heart of a noble young writer remains in the film.","

"youbigbluemonkey","16 December 2006","You would have thought that after the shambles of Dungeons & Dragons that poor Ole Jeremy would have stayed away from anything involving dragons, but here it just shows we are doomed to repeat history. I have a bomb shelter in my garden in case history repeats Battlefield Earth (shudder) The plot that fell out of a Christmas cracker seems to be taken from whatever was on the DVD rental shelf that day giving the impression of a very, very sloppy put together 'film' The overall Luke sky walker premise of young boy from nowhere having a destiny to fulfil scenario is given no additional meat on its tired bones.Watching it you cant help feel that they got what few films there are featuring dragons and just took the best bits and since Sean Connery's's voice wasn't used in this film that leaves very little.You will notice from this review i go into very little if not nothing about the actual context of the film, this is for two reasons, one it's against my nature to inflict pain on another human being and two I'm not wasting the money i spent on psychiatric sessions to expunge this from my memory only to bring it all up again.If your determined to go see this film i suggest you take your Ipod along and a blindfold","

"ch_pozza","29 January 2007","I had an interest to watch this movie before reading the novel ""Eragon"" by Christopher Paolini. I managed to watch the movie after reading the novel and I was very satisfied on how they put together the movie. Most main content was delivered with excellent detail from the novel. Indeed one would think that so much story in a time-frame of a movie would require lots of cutting of plot. But the Director has wonderfully kept to the story and the screenwriter dismissed some loose ends, that actually made the movie flow more.I give top marks to scenery, especially the use of wide camera angles with the use of panoramic circling of mountains. The Buildings bring out a feel of medieval times, and I am a sucker for medieval themes.The actors are chosen well.But most importantly, THIS MOVIE IS WELL WORTH THE VIEWING TIME. And if you are a lover of fantasy, then you will continue imagining the wonders outside the cinema.Top marks for a well brought out movie!","

"Queen_oogabooga","20 June 2008","About three years ago a friend of mine pushed the Eragon book at me, telling me that I just had to read it. And, after reading it I was completely in love with it. So as you can imagine I was very excited when the movie came out. I saw it the very first day, thinking that it would be just the best movie. I was very angry as I left the theater. They cut out over half the story, and the story they did leave in really didn't make any sense at all. The acting was poor, the special effect left much to be desired, and I was utterly confused. The Urgals looked like big scary guys with too many tattoos, Murtagh appeared out of nowhere in the middle of the story, Solembum was nowhere to be seen, and the twins never bothered to show up. If that wasn't enough they sent Roran off to avoid being drafted for the war, and Saphira did a years worth of growing after fifteen seconds in a lightning storm. What was going on? I have no idea. Even Rachel Wiesz's wonderful performance as the voice of Saphira couldn't save this one. So once again, what were they thinking? One of the best fantasy novels written in recent years, has been absolutely slaughtered in this very badly made adaptation.","

"firefox2k","15 December 2006","As a fan of both JK Rowling, and Christopher Paolini, I loved the books ""Harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban"" and "" Eragon"". I have seen both movies, and thought the same of both movies. HOW CAN THIS BE DONE, and WHY, did the author let such trash go by? But i think there is much prejudice as far as authors go. Prisoner of Azkaban movie sucked, BIG TIME, but many comments of people on here and other places, loved it, even though just like Eragon, the movie had much eliminated, changed, rushed , and just shot terribly. How can 2 movies, that were based on books, that were horrible movie representations, have such broad views of movie-goers and fans??But about the movie....It was rushed, the story was sub-par, the acting was very cardboard, and the effects were passable. but at least they wore costumes, and i didn't see many microphones or camera shaking like i did in Azkaban.Hollywood put this together to make money, bottom line. But if they plan on a sequel....I hope they take their time,and actually, work on producing a great film. Hire a better director, lead actor, and writers. Also FOLLOW the book more, and allow ATLEST 2 hours to tell the story. For the book Eldest, i would say 2 hours and 40 minutes would be a good time length.","

"metalla25","17 August 2014","""Hey guys, we should totally make a movie out of this awesome book by Christopher Paolini!"" ""Nah, that'll take too much effort. Instead let's just combine the plot of Star Wars with every other fantasy movie ever and just go crazy. Oh, and let's call it Eragon. That's a cool name."" The. Worst. Film. Adaptation. Of. A. Book. Ever. Made. If you can even call it an adaptation. Boring, poorly acted, illogical, way too fast-paced, filled with bland characters and peppered with clichés, not only does it omit 90% of VERY IMPORTANT details that actually made the book interesting, it seems to do it to deliberately make it look like more of a copy of Star Wars than the book was. A shame that such a phenomenal (though admittedly rather derivative) book is represented by this farce. I will never understand why people were wasting time protesting the release of The Da Vinci Code (which, contrary to popular belief, is a good movie) when their time would have been much better spent boycotting this colossal crap fest. So yeah, good luck making adaptations of Eldest, Brisingr and Inheritance when you KILLED OFF TOO MANY CHARACTERS WHO WERE IMPORTANT TO CERTAIN Plot lines OF THOSE BOOKS.","

"bnz99","6 April 2007","I don't agree to most of the (negative) comments about this movie. I really enjoyed that movie thoroughly. I think the actors do really well, the landscape shots are just beautiful, and the story is very absorbing. I really was part of this dragon world for the time it lasted. The limitation of this positive comment may be indeed that i have not read the book and thus cannot tell whether the movie is faithful to the book or if important parts of the story line are missing. I also agree that the movie seemed a bit rushed and it may be a little short for the story it tries to tell. I don't agree that this is a movie merely for kids. I consider it a positive thing that the movie is not as graphically violent as comparable movies.",NA
"ChristianSlater4000","7 July 2018","When I first sat down to watch the Eragon film, I thought I was bound to be dissapointed. It's very rare that a film truly follows the book. And yet, this movie manages not only to pull that off, but to be even better than the novel. Great acting, great characters, and I fell IN LOVE with the cgi used on Saphira. Over all, a rare gem and example of how to do a book adaptation right. Ignore the haters, if I could I'd rate this film even higher",NA
"arosedec","17 December 2006","First things first, I have never read the book therefore I am merely commenting on the film itself and not its relation to the book. After having been spoiled by Peter Jackson and his treatment of The Lord of the Rings, the bar has been raised for epic fantasy films. That being said, Eragon does not even come close in that area. All of the characters feel incredibly superficial and the only inspired performance is that of Jeremy Irons. While I love John Malkovich and think he's a wonderful actor, I felt like he was just going through the motions and not really giving it his all. Edward Speleers did give a nice performance but there was no real progression in the character  his performance did not indicate any growth in the character, he was exactly the same as when the story started. In all fairness, the performance issues could be the result of poor directing and a so-so screenplay. Actors can only do so much with what they're given. The film was lacking in any emotion, I did not care what happened to the characters  except maybe for the dragon which was cg. Eragon did not feel like a feature film  it felt more like a SciFi channel original movie. That being said, I'm not upset that I spent the money to see it (although I'm glad that I was able to get a student ticket) however, like the acting performances  I was uninspired.",NA
"thafreaker","15 December 2006","If you read the book, a course the screen version will seem a little different. But it was an okay movie. Kids are going to like this movie, since it is RATED PG. The CGI wasn't that bad. I watched late at night but i was still able to stay awake. It does have some big name actors, how they got them I don't know. John Malkovich must have shot his scene in like a day since he was only on screen for some scenes.I went in with low expectations so it did get a little better as the movie went along. Got some kids, or are a kid go check this one out. Its only about 1hr55 with movie trailers, so the time will go by a bit fast.",NA
