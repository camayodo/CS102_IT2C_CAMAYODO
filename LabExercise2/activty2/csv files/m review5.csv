"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","2 May 2020","The Incredible Hulk, based on another marvel superhero and also the 1970s TV show, revolves around Bruce Banner becoming a fugitive after his science experiment exposes gamma radiation on him which transforms him into the Hulk which becomes his appearance for brief periods of time. Meanwhile, General Ross and his army including Emil Blonsky tracks down Bruce and little does he know that Emil decides to use a serum that would give him some abilities while also transforming him into an even worse creature imaginable.Out of all the MCU films I've seen, the one that didn't make as much money compared to the others is this. Which is a shame because this is directed by Louis Leterrier, who would later direct the terrible Clash of the Titans remake, Now You See Me, and the recent TV show The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance (which I severely liked). And the acting from everyone involved is good. Edward Norton does a great job as Bruce Banner, Liv Tyler from The Lord of the Rings trilogy does a good job too as Betty as did William Hurt and Tim Roth and Tim Blake Nelson. Sure, the villain could've been developed more and the second act of the film could've been better, but everything else is done very well. The cinematography is gorgeous, the pacing is decent, the editing is superb, the music from Craig Armstrong is rousing, and the action sequences are solid.So, overall, this isn't a perfect film by any means but it's way better than the 2003 version (which isn't terrible but could've been much better). To those who have seen most of the MCU films or not, certainly give this one a go. :)","

"Oeuvre_Klika","8 May 2019","As I am writing this review, Avengers: Endgame is breaking box-office records as the culmination of 11 years of the MCU. Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.However, this movie is an oddity in the MCU. It isn't considered an essential watch, a lot of people just forget about it, or simply have never seen it. And this isn't very suprising, as The Incredible Hulk has a completely different feel as any other MCU movie. There are no vibrant colors, jokes are few and far between, and, supreme heresy, it doesn't even feature the beloved Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / the Hulk. Despite that, I think this movie should be more recognized by Marvel enthusiasts.For one, I was surprised at the number of foreshadowing in it. Despite its reputation, it is very clear, watching now, that it was definitely intended as the beginning of a cinematic universe. There are references to Stark Industries, to super soldiers, to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the movie clearly lays the ground for a sequel (that never happened and probably never will).The performances were strong, and I will single out Edward Norton, who left the Marvel boat after this, for reasons still a bit unclear. Watching this movie made me regret that he didn't stay in the role for more movies (no disrespect to Mr. Ruffalo whom I like a lot, as does everyone). I am a big fan of Edward Norton in general, from whom I have never seen an unenjoyable performance. That stays true for this movie. To me, his casting as Bruce Banner was an inspired one. He portrayed the tortured soul of the character exactly as I envision it, and with a lot of nuances.The story itself isn't very remarkable. It's fairly conventional, although maybe not totally conventional for a superhero movie. I would say it's more of a thriller, about a man on the run from the military who are after his secrets and his life. We've seen this story before, but here the man also happens to turn into a big, green monster when his pulse gets too high. It isn't just a thriller, though, bu also very much a love story, which may be one of the reasons of its unpopularity (?). If that's the case, then it's a shame, because I found the love story actually well done. There was a real chemistry between Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, who portrayed a sweet, but capable Betty Ross, and there wasn't a moment where I didn't believe that these two characters were completely in love.What this movie might be criticized for, is a lack of the titular Hulk. It's true that it's mainly Banner's story. However, the scenes in which the Hulk appears are very satisfying. I must say I was impressed by the CGI. It isn't as modern as what we're used to see nowadays, but still very good. In a movie with such a realistic feel, it's even more difficult to make a huge CGI monster look like it's really there in the scene, but I though that it worked perfectly.This movie definitely is the odd one out in regards to the whole MCU, but I think it deserves not to be forgotten or dismissed. Not only is its quality on par with other, more popular Marvel movies, it is also our only Hulk solo movie, and it will stay so for the foreseeable future, due to the distribution deal between Marvel and Universal. So, if you're taking a nostalgia trip through the history of the MCU, or if you're only just now starting to delve into this cinematic universe, don't skip the Incredible Hulk.","

"MovieAddict2016","15 June 2008","In 2003, Ang Lee's Hulk was released to commercial success  breaking box office records for a June opening and smashing its way to the top of the box office, it outperformed many analysts' expectations and was well on its way to becoming one of the biggest comic book films ever produced.Then, of course, the negative word of mouth caught up with it  and by the following weekend it had dropped a colossal 60%. It was quickly left floundering in theaters and only turned a profit thanks to worldwide intake.Marvel wasn't quite sure what to do  the film's huge opening indicated an inherent interest in the material, but fans obviously didn't enjoy what they were seeing.Ang Lee's film was, to be fair, admirable in its scope and ambitions  it wasn't your typical comic book action film. But, at the end of the day, most audiences don't want two-and-a-half hour psychological explorations when they go to see a Hulk movie  they want big battle scenes and lots of bruising action, both of which the 2003 Hulk  for the most part  failed to deliver.I count myself among the masses that disliked the 2003 film  not because I was a fan of the comics and not because I was disappointed in its treatment of the material; not even because I thought it was boring, necessarily. I simply thought in spite of its aim to be an intelligent movie, it was quite silly and pretentious  the end fight sequence was appalling, for example. It was a film containing moments of genius cornered by lots of unnecessary scenes and scenery chewing by Nick Nolte.So, with this in mind, the ultimate question is: does the 2008 Hulk deliver on its promise to be bigger, bolder and better? Well, in short, yes  it's still not a great film by any means, and it has its fair share of flaws (most notably the last twenty minutes which, despite a cool battle sequence, go overboard in their destruction), but at the end of the day, it's an entertaining summer blockbuster with a cast that's probably a little better than it deserves.Edward Norton would have been my last choice as Bruce Banner  not because I think he's bad for the role, but rather because he is such an unexpected choice. Renowned for his anti-mainstream approach to film-making and his artistic credibility, his placement in a comic book franchise sequel/reboot is puzzling to say the least  it would be like Christian Bale taking on a role in a Batman or Terminator movie (oh, wait).The thing is: Norton delivers a solid performance. I'm not sure if it's better than what Eric Bana tried to achieve (I'd say Bana's performance is a bit more complex overall), but I think that's partly due to the film's length and also because it's so action-packed. For what it's worth, Norton tries his best to inject some humanity into the character; the whole Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde aspect is more prevalent here than in the 2003 film. In that movie, Bana's Banner admitted to enjoying the transformation into the Hulk; in 2008, Norton is struggling to conceal and control it.William Hurt replaces Sam Elliot as General Ross, the man responsible for Bruce's predicament. The movie is essentially a cat-and-mouse game, with Banner hiding away in Brazil for over a year, until Ross finally discovers his location  prompting Bruce to flee back to North America in a last-ditch effort to find a cure for his ""disease."" He reunites with Ross' daughter, Betty (Liv Tyler), and finds himself at odds with an overzealous combatant named Blonsky (played by Tim Roth), who eventually transforms into Abomination.My problems with the film are most present in the latter half. The first 45 minutes is a lot of fun and is rather cleverly made  the fight scenes are engaging and Roth establishes his anti-hero villain. But suddenly halfway through the movie, Blonsky turns into an unmotivated cliché of a bad guy, and by the end of the film you lose all care and understanding for the character. Once he transforms into the Abomination and goes on a citywide rampage in search of an equal foe (in this case, the Hulk), his reasons are puzzling.This is where the film truly falls apart, because suddenly General Ross is responsible for millions of dollars' worth of damage and civilian casualties (without spoiling any surprises, he is responsible for Blonsky's transformation), and he's flying around in an Army helicopter following the city's destruction, but nobody really seems to care. He never loses his job, even after he tears up a college campus in search of the Hulk earlier in the film. It may be pointless to criticize a comic book film for lapses in logic, but since the film strives for a sense of realism in its early scenes, the switch to excess halfway through is a bit disheartening. The 2003 Hulk had the same problems, incidentally  I'm wondering if it's a flaw of the comic book or just the character itself; perhaps it's too hard to retain realism when you've got a 12-foot giant green dude destroying everything in sight.If I'm being too critical, it's only because I enjoyed the film and regretted these aspects. At the end of the day, it's a fun, entertaining summer blockbuster -- and that's really all it needed to be.","

"Aaron1375","15 June 2008","This movie was the second film to release that would set up the 2012 Avengers film. In retrospect, it was a bit of a mistake as it did underwhelming business at the box office; especially when you compare the box office take of this film and the first film to release, Iron Man. Why is it a mistake, well there was already a Hulk movie released only five years prior to this one and it too was a disappointment. That being said, this is the better film than the 2003 Ang Lee film, I just feel it released too soon after it. I think if that film had not existed, this one would have performed considerably better. Not the 300 plus Iron Man did, but perhaps a 200 million dollar film rather than making about the same amount as Ang Lee's film did. I also believe they tried to do a bit too much with the story, not that it is complex, just that they almost blend the comics, with the television show and the 2003 film. At the end of the 2003 film, Bruce is in South America, at the beginning of this one he is in Brazil...so it's a sequel? No, not at all. The origin that is shown during the credits alludes to the television show, but Hulk looks like the comics. Just too much and trying to appease too many people all at the same time. I also think Norton was poorly cast in this one, as I did not get a Banner vibe from him at all. He just does not seem like he is into the role and considering he did not opt into doing the Avengers film and beyond suggests that he was not into it.The story has Bruce in Brazil working at some strange soda plant or something. Looks like Mt. Dew, but has some funky name. Well, a slight accident leads to some of his blood getting into a bottle and this is how the military and General Ross track him down. Bruce is in chats with a man dubbed Mr. Blue in the hopes of finding a cure; however, he must find more data for Mr. Blue to create a cure. A crack team of soldiers try to track down Banner and he avoids them for a while, but soon turns into the Hulk, leading one of the soldiers, Emil Blonsky, wanted another crack at the beast. He is soon infused with super soldier serum and does quite admiral in dodging the Hulk, but it is still not enough. He craves the power the Hulk haves and soon this desire will create an abomination! The film is pretty good, but could have been better. The scenes with the Hulk are by far the highlights and better than any of the Hulk scenes in the 2003 film with the incredible expanding Hulk. That being said, I did not like the fact they tied Banner turning into Hulk with his heart rate as it is solely tied to his anger. The film also did not portray the Hulk becoming stronger the angrier he got and the fight with Abomination should have showcased this. In the comics, Hulk is stronger than Abomination because of the increase as he gets angry. Abomination though is a better fighter as he is more agile and that is why he gives the Hulk a good fight, not because he is stronger. The reason the Hulk wins is because he keeps getting stronger, not because he is a better tactical fighter.So, in the end, this film was more enjoyable than the Ang Lee film. That film was just strange in many ways as it played out in comic panels which suggests a fun film, but was so serious with virtually not humor that it was just a strange concoction. This one had some good action, but was not a perfect film. Hurt is the only actor from this film to be seen in a later Marvel universe film as he appeared in Captain America: Civil War. Most things from this film were pretty much scrapped though as the Leader looked to be coming, Abomination was still alive and various other things. Abomination was supposedly going to be in the second Avengers film and that would have been great as I felt Ultron was not enough, but they decided against it which sucked as something other than the exact same robot would have been cool. In the end, this film is kind of part of the Marvel universe and kind of not.","

"A_Different_Drummer","20 February 2016","About 1100 reviews on the old IMDb and I am going to do something I have never done before -- review on a bell curve.Seriously, before you start listing all the things you DIDN'T like, ask yourself how many live action Hulk movies have there been outside of the Avenger ensemble acts? Answer: Two. Only two. Just two.And the entry from Ang Lee was so wretched, so horrific, that this one gets a push up the curve.It is actually a solid film. Roth makes a great villain. Tyler was a great love interest. (The scene where Hulk becomes a giant fire extinguisher is one for the record books and memorable). And Norton is arguably the highest-level A-lister to ever play the role.(Or, also arguably, to ever play it again -- notice he was gone from the Avenger movies. Also notice that the two solo-Hulk movies did so poorly at the box office that this one actually ends with a promo for the coming Avengers, suggesting that the suits at Marvel are no longer interested in gambling on Hulk in a film by himself and all your future Hulk movies may be of the animated variety).All done, this is a much better film than the reviews would suggest.","

"DICK STEEL","12 June 2008","The crowded streets and cluttered housing on the streets of Rio De Janeiro provided some reminiscence of Jackie Chan's Police Story, where you could be sure of a chase scene zig- zagging the streets to take advantage of the wonderful opportunities presented for an exhilarating chase. And Leterrier doesn't try not to provide action junkies plenty of action- smashing moments as we root for Bruce Banner to hulk up, unfortunately of course, to satisfy our lust for some unadulterated action where everything in the way of the Hulk, gets smashed. However those expecting action from the get go will be disappointed, as there were only a small handful of action sequences, though of course they include the classic moments that comic fans had been baying for since 4 years ago. So I guess most will be left happy as we see some nifty moves by the Hulkster, which will leave a smile on your face, despite being used in limited doses. But I note though that the story cum action, looked a little bit like Superman II with the seeking of a cure and the deliberate loss of power to be with the lady love, and the duking out between super-beings on equal footing (here being gamma-powered), with a tinge of Cloverfield like moments too.While there will be those who will gripe about the transformation mainly done in the dark and in shadows, it does prove to be effective in building some anticipation and heigntened tension as to when he will finally appear in full glory. The mainly military attacks on the big guy again brought out some back to basics adversary with Thunderbolt Ross trying to capture the Hulk, and in fact I'd appreciate that this movie didn't divert too much away from this primary objective, although it might be more of the same from the first movie. But while the Hulk has an aura of invulnerability, somehow The Incredible Hulk provided me at least, an emotional pang when he gets hurt bad, as we remember that this is a guy who just plainly wants to be left alone. And the angrier the Hulk gets, the bigger and more powerful he becomes too.And it's not all serious here too, with well meaning humour peppered in the right places, making numerous references to the television series and characters from the Marvel universe. You'd often wonder how his pants stay on before-during-and-after transformation, well, it gets addressed here with humour. Memorable ines such as ""don't- make-me-angry-you-wouldn't-like-me-when-I'm-angry"" gets punned away, even the late Bill Bixby got a cameo, together with Lou Ferrigno who reprises his security guard role, and Stan Lee who's possibly in the most unmemorable cameo appearance ever. The much touted Tony Stark appearance will bring whoops of joy from newly converted fans of Robert Downey Jr, while I suspect in line with the rumoured Avengers movie, the universe now seemed more streamlined again with the references to SHIELD, and stupid me thinking that Mr Fantastic would somewhat be featured in this too. A WWII super soldier project and serum was referenced and formed the basis for Tim Roth's Emil Blonsky turned Abomination, but Captain America? I'll leave that to you to find out.But what I really liked about The Incredible Hulk is not the action sequences, nor the references mentioned made. It was the central love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross. In Lee Ang's version, we don't see much of the romance between Bana and Connelly because the story didn't really call for it, save for a rescue scene, and at an in-juncture where the Hulk was stopped in his tracks by his lady love. And that was precisely the winner for me. The Hulk, for all his power and unstoppable rage, could be brought under control by his lady love, and that was used to great effect here. Beneath the green invulnerability lies the heart of a mild-mannered man who yearns to be with the love of his life, but unfortunately cannot due to the curse that Fate had brought upon him. Both Norton and Tyler managed to bring out this chemistry of lovers torned apart, one who can only admire the other from afar, and the other finally never wanting to let go of someone who had disappeared from her life for her own protection. And this version of Betty does sport a bit of a temper and feisty too, and is not really your classic damsel in distress.Granted that most supporting characters were rather one-dimensional, The Incredible Hulk somehow managed to straddle between its intense whack-all-destroy-all moments, and tender ones when the lovers are left alone to their own devices. As with the Marvel movies to date, the doors are left wide opened for follow ups and team-ups, and here there are no less than three avenues where the next story could develop further from, and sowed the seed for other movie franchises to be developed too. It drained a little bit from the cerebral department in order to amplify the romance, and let the action go into overdrive. HUlk Smash indeed, this time likely to make a huge dent at the box office, for fans and non-fans alike to be won over, just like how Iron Man did.","

"vip_ebriega","22 January 2010","My Take: Flawed but modestly entertaining, and compared to the previous HULK opus, a little better.Among the others, I was disappointed by Ang Lee's HULK. I have no problem with a more character-driven superhero/comic book movie, but in the expense of deepening the character's persona, it lacks the good ol' comic book action fans have grown to love. Louis Leterrier's reboot/semi-sequel THE INCREDIBLE HULK makes up for that. It's still a flawed experience, with some scenes that still pad out the better bits, but in terms of pure big-screen comic book experience, it's an improvement, albeit not a vast one.In case you actually liked the Ang Lee version, Leterrier and writers Zak Penn (and Edward Norton, who made an uncredited re-write on his character) doesn't really forget the events of the first movie, but still makes sure everyone else keeps up with a new and different story. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is now in hiding, still in search for a cure for his ""sickness"" with the help of an unseen contributor. Meanwhile, Gen. Ross (William Hurt) is still in search of our monster-transforming fugitive, this time with the help of a bloodthirsty assassin (Tim Roth) who is proves his more than a match for our hero (and we learn later, more than a match for the Hulk as well).Unlike Lee's artsy version, Leterrier isn't afraid to push through with the action for most of the time, even if his direction of the dramatic scenes are just as slow-moving as Lee's. The still-developing romance between Buce and Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) just doesn't spark. Norton, a fine actor who does a good job in deepening the character, just lacks the charisma of even a doomed comic book character, while Tyler just doesn't add anything to the role. Hurt and Roth actually add some actual depth to the proceedings. While it won't compare to the Iron Men and Dark Knights of the same year, Leterrier does deliver the ""Hulk Smash"" fans expect, if very little else.Rating: *** out of 5.","

"brando647","16 November 2008","I was not one of those who hated Ang Lee's 2003 portrayal of the Hulk. I did enjoy it to an extent; it was a bit slow-moving and there were some parts that needed some improvement, but it was overall a decent film. I do agree that Louis Letterier's 2008 film was a vast improvement, though. It improved on all of the issues I had with Lee's film. The film is a reboot of the dying franchise: Bruce Banner has been hiding in Brazil, attempting to keep a low profile while he searches for a cure for his condition, but General Ross becomes aware of his location and enlists the aid of Emil Blonsky, a soldier with a mean streak. A bit of non-sanctioned experimentation later and Blonsky becomes a creature rivaling even the Hulk in power.One issue I had with Lee's 2003 film was the slow-pacing; the film felt as if it dragged forever between action scenes. It wasn't necessarily the fault of the cast, but seemed more to do with a story that didn't really grab me. Letterier's film amps up the excitement and interest levels a bit with a stronger story and better action sequences. The Hulk's fight against three gamma-irradiated dogs in the previous film doesn't even compare to the Hulk's battle against the Army on the college campus in this film. I didn't see the Hulk from 2003 as being overly-cartoonish in appearance but I can see how some others did. The new film gives the Hulk a grittier, stronger, more realistic style (as realistic as a 9-foot tall green giant can be) and the Abomination looks just as good.In general, I also dug the new cast better than the previous. Ed Norton was great as Bruce Banner, giving him a great blend of meekness and inner strength. From what I understand, Norton is a huge fan of the source material so you know he must've given this role everything he had. I enjoyed Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, though there were times when I missed Jennifer Connelly, and Tim Roth has long been one of my favorite actors so it was great to see him go with the villainous side this time around as Blonsky. William Hurt was a fine General Ross though, just as Liv Tyler, there were times when I thought Sam Elliot would've put in a stronger performance (plus, there were a handful of instances where Hurt came off as over-acting a bit, in my opinion...).It's great to have the character of the Hulk back in the hands of Marvel and they've done a great job of rejuvenating the franchise. I loved this film and, while it wasn't on par with 2008's Iron Man film, it was a great superhero flick. The action was brutal, the story was entertaining, and the cast was near perfect. My only real issue with the film was the ending; without going into detail, I thought the resolution of the final battle between the Hulk and Abomination was anti-climactic. I remember first watching the scene and the only thought that popped into my head was ""That's IT?!"". Otherwise, it's a great movie and a good way to spend two hours.","

"cherold","12 September 2012","With only the vaguest whiff of a story and a lack of character development even in Bruce Banner, the sort of tortured conflicted comic book character seemingly custom-made for character development, The Incredible Hulk really only has its special effects going for it. And while those are decent, a movie that is nothing but its special effects is not a movie.Ed Norton doesn't really do much with the role. Yes, I know Ed Norton is a brilliant actor prone to giving amazing performances, but he just doesn't do that here; Mark Rufallo's laconic Bruce Banner in the Avengers is far more interesting than Norton's here.Frankly, I was just bored. Not so bored that I stopped watching, but consistently restless and never drawn in.","

"springsunnywinter","9 June 2008","By the looks of the ending of Ang Lee's Hulk (2003) it seemed that there is going to be a sequel. After 5 years we now have The Incredible Hulk which is a reboot like Batman Begins. The reboot was a better idea than a sequel because Hulk (2003) wasn't a bad movie but wasn't even great either and was better off as a one film itself. But if the first attempt at a Hulk movie left you feeling a little green, good news! This version has a whole new cast, a whole new mood, and even a whole new retelling of The Hulk's originWhen I saw the trailer of The Incredible Hulk I was like ""Wow this movie looks cool"" and it lived up to my expectation also the trailer did not give too much away about the plot. The film was outrageously entertaining, fun and a perfect popcorn movie. It is the same director of The Transporter 2 so it is bound to have good action. You can see every penny spent from the $130 million budget. It is roughly (not exactly) the same amount as Hulk (2003) and The Incredible Hulk looks much, much more expensive.The story is about Bruce Banner who is trying to cure is condition that turns him into a monster but is going to use it as his weapon against the Abomination. The plot may seem simple but it is better that way because you can just concentrate on the action and the monsters.This time the Hulk is more darker and sinister looking and is more muscular than Ang Lee's Hulk. The Abomination was the icing & cherry on the cake and I'm glad that they had a proper villain this time. His name really does match his personality and he is not wearing any underpants, so girls you might want to look away otherwise you might get a fright. Overall this movie is Incredible not an Abomination.","

"planktonrules","24 July 2010","Before getting into the film, I should probably point out that I am not the best reviewer for this film--unless, like me, you aren't all that familiar with the Hulk. Apart from seeing the pilot of the TV series and riding on the Hulk ride at Universal's theme park, The Island's of Adventure, I have never seen anything of the green guy--not a single comic book nor the previous movie from 2003. So, for the die-hard Hulkophile, I am certainly not the best person to review the film. In fact, I only have watched super hero films because I have a friend and daughter who push me to give them a try. And, in general, I have enjoyed them...but I am still not a big fan.This film is a sequel (of sorts) and it's obvious from the beginning that the film has come after a lot of things have occurred. Bruce Banner is already the Hulk and how that all came to be was explored in the first film...or at least that's what I've been told. Oddly, he's in Brazil and perhaps he chose this nation because of their spiffy green flag. After a short time, the evil general (William Hurt) and his minions pounce on Banner and try to kidnap him. Not unexpectedly, Banner becomes Hulk and kicks butt. Later, they try the same thing repeatedly, but this time they give Tim Roth (why is an English guy playing a guy in the US Army, by the way--he certainly was no Rambo!) a series of injections to make him a super-soldier--and giving him a chance to defeat the Hulk. The only trouble is--who is going to control this new insanely dangerous nemesis.Despite my being a relative Hulk newbie, I was surprised that my opinion AND the opinion of both my daughters (including the comic book geek one) was pretty much the same. The film had some nice action but not a whole lot else. As for the rest of the film, it was a tad dull and the relationship with the girl really seemed to slow down the film. As a result, the film is a time-passer and not a whole lot more. I sure hope that the folks at Marvel think twice about all their many, many announced upcoming films. If you keep making mediocre super-hero films, you might just end up killing the genre. This is NOT a film of the same quality as ""Iron Man"" or ""The Dark Knight"" (yes, Marvel fans, I know this is a DC franchise--back off, nerd-boys!!!).","

"abecip","16 June 2008","First off, let's get one thing straight - - - this movie is NOT a sequel to the 2003 Hulk which had attempts to portray many things from the Hulk comics (father-son conflict, father-daughter strained relationship, a love triangle of sorts) that resulted in a confusing, sometimes scary (remember that scene where The Hulk was fighting off killer dogs?) movie.This Incredible Hulk version is a simpler story; however, with strong performances by Edward Norton, William Hurt and Liv Tyler, it entertains (yes the key word is that it ENTERTAINS) better than its predecessor.While it retains a more serious tone generally than, say Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk is definitely not a pushover when it comes to getting fans to enjoy a good movie. The action sequences, though not that many, were pretty good. Whatever lacking in action you think it has in the beginning, the climax between the Hulk and Abomination (you've seen that in the trailer so no spoiler there) should more than make up for it. It doesn't have many light moments (I only count about 3, really, cause they were quite few so I remembered them), but it wasn't as totally dark as the Ang Lee version.And to some extent, at least this Hulk is less CGI/cartoony-looking than the last one. While he does have those weird ridges/lines stretching across his body, making the muscles seem different than what you'd see on a big body builder, this Hulk is more realistic (but really, how realistic can you get with a CGI-made anti-hero?), so you at least have an improvement there.Edward Norton is more believable as the ""tragic-story-of-my-life"" protagonist Bruce Banner (no offense to Eric Bana, but he was just too muscular and less flawed-looking that Norton). The one actor I miss here, though, is Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross. While Liv Tyler's portrayal was credible enough, I don't think anyone can beat Jennifer's take on Ms. Ross.Overall, I give it a 7 out of 10. Good enough to watch, entertaining and enjoyable without the complexities that the 2003 movie brought to the table, and a worthy addition to cinematic adaptation library that Marvel's adding every year. Hopefully, it will pick up steam after people realize that it's not the complicated, semi-psychological thriller (?) movie that the 2003 Hulk attempted to be. Rather an enjoyable cinematic achievement that's good enough to watch on the big screen.","

"Robert_duder","23 June 2008","I am going to re-watch Ang Lee's Hulk generally considered disastrous by fans so I can review it properly but I seem to remember it being pretty awful and in no way an homage to the monstrous hero that fans love. Now I'm not a huge Marvel fan by any means but I love the hero movie and they needed to redeem Hulk and The Incredible Hulk redeemed him and then some. This was the true Hulk film that fans would have wanted and now we can firmly pretend HULK never existed. Relatively new director Louis Leterrier takes the helm and makes Ang Lee look like an amateur and clearly Leterrier must be a Hulk fan or at least turned to enormous Hulk fans because this had everything. The film paid huge homage to the original 70's/80's series which I think is just incredible. It used the music from the original series on one or two occasions, Edward Norton seemed to really channel and pay respect to Bill Bixby's Banner character and his transformation definitely leaned towards that. Terrific cameos from Stan Lee (as always), the original Hulk himself Lou Ferrigno in a terrific and funny cameo that felt like a hand over of the Hulk reigns (although it was only coffee), Robert Downey Jr., and mentions of Stark Industries (Iron Man), the Super Soldier program (Captain America) and other terrific Easter Eggs.Edward Norton is an amazing actor although he's slipped from high profile in the last few years. He really channels the fugitive scientist looking for a cure part really well and does an amazing job. He's such a non-assuming almost mousy character which is far more like Bill Bixby's Banner than Eric Bana's character in the original Hulk film. Norton is ideal in the role although he may not return in future installments. Liv Tyler is Betsy Ross, Banner's love interest. This is her second summer flick and decisively better performance than The Strangers (although it was a great scare flick.) She gives a better all around performance and has great chemistry with Norton although she is still whiny at times. Tim Roth is a terrific villain, completely on part with other Hero villains that were great. Although his true villainous performance is CGI he still does a great job setting up the character. William Hurt who is a seasoned and often talented character actor does an okay job as General Ross. There is just something missing from the performance. He doesn't seem to have his heart in it and yet he could do very well and is a decent nemesis to Norton's Banner.Many ask what is better Iron Man or The Incredible Hulk. I mean Iron Man really told a great story and established the character whereas The Incredible Hulk took the liberty of summarizing the establishment of the character in the opening credits but mostly assumed we all know how it all began and puts you right into the action. The story in The Incredible Hulk is simplistic and it's all about two hours of The Hulk smashing stuff and that is wicked cool. I just about giggled and clapped when the Hulk actually exclaims ""HULK SMASH"" in one of his rage filled riots. The Incredible Hulk is the perfect summer blockbuster and is already racing to the top of the charts which is good because it is a worthy super hero action flick that anyone should see. Forget the disaster of HULK and go see this because his redemption is super sweet!! 9/10","

"Chrysanthepop","23 October 2008","'The Incredible Hulk' sort of takes of where Ang Lee's 'Hulk' ends. It's not an exact sequel as a few events are changed but arguably it serves well enough as a continuation. This one succeeds in parts where Ang Lee's film failed. Leterrier's direction works for an action film as it's got all the required ingredients. It's a lot slicker and full of action. The pacing is comparatively well set. The special effects are an improvement (but the CGI is still very prominent). The camera-work is solid and the score is wild. The story isn't as effective as say this year's 'Iron Man' because the characters aren't well fleshed out and the dialogues are a bit clichéd. Edward Norton fits the role of Bruce Banner quite well but we don't see much of him because of the CGI hulk. Eric Bana wasn't a bad choice for Ang Lee's Hulk either so I wouldn't compare the two actors. Actually, the Bruce Banner in Ang Lee's version was better fleshed out and gave Bana more scope to perform. Liv Tyler, however, is a little too weepy and she shouts a lot. Clearly Connelly was the better choice. Tim Roth and William Hurt are adequate. Overall, this is an enjoyable action flick even though it's no 'Iron Man'.","

"claudio_carvalho","15 November 2008","Dr. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is secretly living in the greatest slum of South America, the Favela da Rocinha, and working in a factory of ""cachaça"" in Rio de Janeiro. While seeking the cure with his beloved Dr. Elizabeth Ross (Liv Tyler) and other scientists, he learns how to control his emotions and heart beat and to keep his human form for a long period. When General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (William Hurt) finds a clue of his location in Brazil, he sends a command leaded by the tough Major Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to abduct Dr. Banner. However, he transforms in Hulk and escapes to Guatemala. Later he contacts Betty and his colleagues and when he is close to find his cure, Blonsky captures him and transforms himself in powerful beast The Abomination. Dr. Banner has to decide whether he should remain human or transform in The Incredible Hulk again to stop The Abomination.After the ""Shrek-Hulk"" of Ang ""Brokeback Mountain"" Lee, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a wonderful surprise. The story and characters recall the comic books of my childhood, plenty of action and adventure. For Brazilians and more specifically for ""cariocas"" (people born in Rio de Janeiro) like me, it is funny to see Dr. Bruce Banner living in Rocinha, probably the most dangerous location in my city, where the police is afraid to go, chased by the American soldiers. In real life, they certainly would be murdered by the army of drug dealers. Further, I really appreciated the effort of Edward Norton speaking a couple of words and sentences in Portuguese. But the most important, the story is a great and entertaining adventure and the special effects are really good. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Incrível Hulk"" (""The Incredible Hulk"")","

"DarthVoorhees","13 June 2008","The Incredible Hulk is a tough character to adapt and I really think any filmmaker would have trouble making a good film version of the green guy. When a comic book film is adapted to the big screen the movie goer wants a story to balance the action and in this movie we have no story. The entire film is a special effects extravaganza wrapped in between pieces of bad dialouge and characterization. Creating an effective Bruce Banner is key to making any Hulk adaptation work and it hasn't been done yet. The original Incredible Hulk series that is beloved by so many plays like a melodramatic continuation of Adam West's Batman series, and Ang Lee's Hulk, which I feel is still the best adaptation of the story, tried to add too much dramatic substance.Norton structures the story as a fugitive film where the Hulk is constantly on the run from Ross and his endless search. Ross enlists the help of Emil Blonsky, a skilled agent from the British Marines to help him find the Hulk. Blonsky eventually becomes a super villain which leads to one of the most painfully fake looking CGI battles ever seen.The main problem with this film is it's script but the acting isn't good enough to salvage it. Edward Norton doesn't really give me a reason to pity him or feel bad about his condition. Sure he says he is haunted by the prospect of the Hulk hurting people but I didn't get any sense of those emotions in Norton's performance. I don't know what went on because Norton is a very talented actor. I sense he tried to underplay this role. On the other hand William Hurt looks like he wanted to overplay the role and he gives the worst performance of his career as General Thunderbolt Ross. I honestly thought he looked silly in the Ross wardrobe and make-up. Hurt overplays this role and his performance is silly. Liv Tyler is a beauty but her methods of soothing the CGI beast look forced and unreal.Tim Roth is the exception, he is terrific as the villainous Blonsky. He gets too little screen time in my opinion because the way the super soldier injections drive him mad could have made him a more effective villain if he were given more screen time. Roth is underrated actor and he uses the most of his screen time. His dialogue is bad too but he has terrific presence with it. When he bulks up himself the build-up is disappointingly taken away by bad effects and terrible video game dialogue but the performance is still very good.The action scenes are somewhat interesting and they are well imagined but I just felt that they could have done more with the human aspects of the character or at least have him battle more than just the military.The Incredible Hulk ends the same way it began, Bruce Banner is on the run and I am still waiting Hollywood to produce a decent adaptation of this character","

"rama-28","7 June 2008","Take a deep breath when you enter the cinema to see this one because it's just downright breathtaking. THE INCREDIBLE HULK is an amazing summer blockbuster movie. This reboot has made Ang Lee's Hulk back in 2003 seem like it never existed. Edward Norton's version portrays what Hulk is supposed to be on the big screen. Do not bootleg this one, do not wait til it hit DVD, Go watch it in the theaters because I guarantee you it is worth every penny. This movie is spectacular and superb in every way. It's a rock 'em smash 'em, jaw dropping thrill ride.Let's just start with the acting, what a perfect cast ensemble. Edward Norton is a better Bruce Banner than Eric Bana because Edward looks more convincing as a skinny nerd scientist. He embodies the pain and the struggle that his character has to go through. Always running, always hiding, always trying to come up with ways to get rid of the monster in him. William Hurt and Tim Roth have no problem being the bad guys, having played so many other bad guys in many other movies in the past. Tim Blake Nelson giving us hints that he'll become the next arch nemesis The Leader is pretty cool. Liv Tyler is so damn cute. That girl can melt your heart.Now to the best part. The category that makes this movie a winner is its awesome CGI visual effects. Bravo to the brains behind this brilliant technological accomplishment. When Hulk breaks a cop car into half and uses each part as boxing globes, that's just plain badass! The images are so much better and more believable,.. the timing could not have been more right to revamp this character. The storyline helps us understand the characters and their development as they progress but it wastes no time at all on any boring moment.Magnificent stuntwork as well, especially the chase scene in the small town in Brazil. The whole jumping from one roof to another at high speed with bodies bumping into walls or falling down from a considerable height. I have much respect for the stunt people who broke their bones daily for this movie.The story has three main long action packed sequences and the last fight scene is just phenomenal. They weren't kidding when they said that it would last for 26 minutes. Hulk punches Abomination, Abomination, kicks Hulk, Hulk strangles Abomination, Abomination slams Hulk onto a couple of buildings.. Your inner kid will be happy.All the elements of this movie have but one purpose only to entertain your senses to the fullest extent. Your sight and hearing will be treated with the utmost incredible experience of your lifetime. You will find yourself cheering at how great this movie is.The cameo by Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno, who plays Hulk in the old TV series are memorable. The plot also has some punch lines here and there that are silly funny but effective. I'm glad Lou Ferrigno got to voice the Hulk because I can't think of anyone else more perfect for the job. The movie even includes the main theme song from the old TV series starring the late Bill Bixby. What a heartfelt nostalgic tribute.The teaser at the end when Tony Stark meets Gen. Thunderbolt Ross, that part is a show stopper. Director Louise Leterrier and his crew deserves a standing ovation for successfully making an excellent superhero movie which some people thought was going to be as bad as the first Hulk movie. Well, Louise has proved them wrong. Summer 2008 may quite possibly be the best summer movie season ever.","

"femaleanimefan","8 June 2008","I wasn't really sure if I'd like the movie. Ang Lee's version didn't please me at all. It didn't have enough action and it had far too much dialogue. I had never really been a fan of the Hulk comics, but I did like all the movie adaptations of the Marvel Comics. While I didn't enjoy The Incredible Hulk as much as Iron Man, it's still great fun, and it will definitely make a big profit at the box office, and hopefully more money than the first did.I also must say the cast is a lot better this time around. Edward Norton is far more convincing as Bruce Banner than Eric Bana was. Liv Tyler does a good job as Betty, Bruce's girlfriend, though I do like Jennifer Connelly a bit more. The supporting cast is also great, and they all deserve to at least be nominated for some awards. My favorite performance is tied between Norton and Tim Roth.Now, to the special effects. Predictably, they are magnificent. With recent superhero movies, the effects are always brilliant, and they certainly adapted the Hulk character more closely to the original comics from what I've heard. The action scenes are cool and fun to watch, and fans of the comic books will be on the edge of their seat in excitement.All in all, it's a great movie that comic fans should enjoy, and even if you don't really read them, you'll still like the movie, as I did. While it's not my favorite superhero movie, it is a whole lot better than Ang Lee's version, and a fun time at the theater.","

"come2whereimfrom","26 June 2008","From that brilliant poster of Ed Norton dressed all in denim walking away from the huge frame of his alter ego the Hulk to the superb end fight that shows the makers of Spiderman 3 how it should be done this is a great film. Not by any means a brilliant film but a truly enjoyable superhero romp none the less. Gone is the emotion that Ang Lee tried to inject into Hulk (2003) and back is the smashing and shouting and smashing. Plagued by his demons and his uncontrollable green counterpart, Norton plays Dr. Bruce Banner a scientist with a secret, desperate to find a cure. Hot on his heels are the army lead by Emil Blonsky (Roth) under the command of General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross, who just so happens to be the dad of Banners girlfriend Betty (Tyler), who wants to know how he gets all angry and use the technology to create 'super soldiers'. Plus Iron Man Tony Stark is in it. That then is about it, what you get is a chase movie with some great characters, some great effects and a couple of amazing set pieces including the end fight between the Hulk and the Abomination. All in all it's smashing stuff that should leave other superhero films green with envy.","

"Smells_Like_Cheese","20 June 2008","I had a great chance to see The Incredible Hulk yesterday and I wasn't expecting much, after the total flop that was The Hulk in 2003, I wasn't too sure that this was a good idea. Now, granted, Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors of all time, he is just terrific and has such a wide range of characters. Seeing him for the first time in a super hero movie was going to be interesting. But from the trailer, this looked once again like it was going to be over the top and not really entertaining. However The Incredible Hulk was actually... incredible! It was highly entertaining, the CGI was a thousand times more believable than the 2003 movie, the actors were great, and it pays great homages to the TV show and comic book for the fans. The Incredible Hulk does have small flaws, but the story keeps you interested and Edward Nortn couldn't have been a more perfect choice as The Hulk.Bruce did a new experiment that made him into the hulk, causing every angry reaction he has turning him into a green nine foot monster that is virtually indestructible. But he has run off to South America until he can find a cure for this ""desease"" and be with the love of his life, Betty. But when the FBI surrounds him, he heads back to America with the promise of a cure from his friend, Dr. Blue. But as soon as he heads back, an army experiment gone evil with Blonsky turns him into an evil hulk and Bruce must face him off.The Incredible Hulk is a great summer movie and I highly recommend it. The story can be a little slow at times, but I thought the effects and acting was just fantastic. I really loved watching The Indcredible Hulk, this is a summer block buster that I have been waiting for, I know a lot of people are rooting for Iron Man, but I feel like The Incredilbe Hulk is in a class of it's own. Edward Norton and Tim Roth were great on screen and had a real presence. Tim was so frightening, he was awesome and his villain couldn't have been more on key. I highly recommend The Incredible Hulk, this was a great movie that I'm sure any one could just have a blast with.9/10","

"drqshadow-reviews","11 September 2011","There ought to be a law for relaunches of a franchise less than five years after the last attempt: every negative must be destroyed if it winds up being even worse. From start to finish, this was a total mess of a film that seemed more interested in finding room for not-so-subtle cameos and wink-nudge-grins than telling a functional story. Knocking out the Hulk's fabled origin story during the opening credits may have freed up the rest of the picture to explore new territory, but it also killed the basis of the cast's relationships and removed any reason for the audience to care about them. Ed Norton and Liv Tyler turn in genuinely rotten performances, with a black hole of chemistry as an on-screen duo, that are neither true to the original characters nor interesting in the slightest. Bruce Banner never comes off as remotely intelligent, let alone the super genius he'd have to be to come up with the formula that turned him into the Hulk, and actually spends more time running from grossly generic government operatives than using his brains. That effectively kills the intriguing contrast between he and the Hulk that should be fueling the story. Both characters are mindlessly running, just in opposite directions. Corny dialog, predictable twists and turns, weak CG, flat characterization and sleepwalking actors - this blew up in Marvel's face.","

"griffolyon12","15 June 2008","I am not going to lie, I really was not that excited for this film when it was first announced, simply because the last time the Hulk made it to the big screen it was such a disappointment. Ang Lee's Hulk film from 2003 was a poor adaptation of one of my favorite comic book heroes. I have always loved the comics, but felt that the film didn't do the character justice, where as this new Hulk film, which is a reboot of the Hulk franchise, finally took advantage of the Hulk franchise and delivers an adaptation that is both truthful to the comics and entertaining at the same time.Within the Incredible Hulk, we get a story that is more in keeping with that of the original comics from the '60s, and it also has a lot in kin with the T.V. Show from the '70s as well. The story begins in Brazil where we meet Dr. Bruce Banner, who has already been infected by the Gamma Rays which make him become the Hulk when he becomes angry. Here in Brazil, Banner is trying to discover a formula to cure him of his big green menace, as well he is undergoing treatment sessions to try and understand a way to control his anger. Banner is currently marked as a fugitive from the United States, and is constantly hunted by the military. All of this is familiar territory to anyone who liked the old television series, or the original comics. Of course the story really doesn't punch into high gear until Banner must return to the U.S. in order to meet a scientist who claims he can help Bruce to possibly find a cure for his problem. Once Bruce returns to his home country, he reunites with his love interest Betty Ross, and together the two try to thwart the ever persistent government and get to New York to meet the scientist who wishes to help Banner.I will be very truthful here, this is my favorite film of the summer so far, and in retrospect it might just very well be my favorite film of the year thus far. As a fan of the comic I am a little bit biased, as I always am with comic book movies, but this one really is a great film. Now this film is by no means going to be an Oscar contender next year, except maybe for Special Effects, but it is by far the most fun I have had at the movies in a long time. What this film delivers is a Hulk film with tons of action and explosions, that has a terrific story to go along with it, but it also is able to finally deliver audiences a Hulk story that allows the Hulk to be a hero, and not just a guy who destroys stuff when he gets angry.As previously mentioned, the story is terrific, with a terrific script that obviously benefited with Edward Norton's help, especially when it comes to the tight dialogue. As well the directing by Louis Leterrier was really great for this particular type of popcorn movie, successfully delivering both the great action of the story and the more intimate dramatic sequences to the audience. Then the acting was really superb as well, in particular Edward Norton as Banner and Liv Tyler as Betty, both of whom clearly have real chemistry and work really well together on screen. After that it is just a role call of well executed production values, nothing was really that weak; but the one other production value that truly stands out is the Special Effects. The CGI is some of the best that I have seen in a long time, it would definitely be a shame if this film doesn't receive an Oscar nod for it Effects.Overall the Incredible Hulk is an amazing film that definitely lives up to its Incredible title. The action is amazing, each action sequence among some of the best I have seen in a while; in particular the final fight scene between the Hulk and the Abomination, which has gone down in my books as one of the finest superhero vs. super villain fights in movie history, and the fight literally, I am not exaggerating, goes on for close to 10-15 minutes. After seeing it I can see why many critics don't like it for it focusing more on action and spectacle than its 2003 predecessor, but what it does deliver is a crowd pleasing Hulk film that is sure to please both audiences and die hard comic book fans alike. I can not wait for a sequel, I am definitely hoping it makes enough money at the box office to allow it.I give the Incredible Hulk an Incredible 10 out of 10!","

"ivo-cobra8","27 December 2015","The Incredible Hulk (2008) is A Marvel pure, fun, popcorn, Action superhero Film! This film is miles way better than The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron and 2003 film Hulk! I take this movie over both Avengers films and 2003 Hulk! This movie right now is still to this day, the most underrated Marvel movie of all-time. The majority of people disliking this movie and loves Mark Ruffalo's Avengers Hulk. In my opinion Edward Norton's Hulk/Bruce Banner is still to this day the best (not saying that Mark Ruffalo was bad because by all means he wasn't). This movie has class effects and it just as good as Iron Man. After watching Hulk (2003) I was really, really disappointed over that lame over long, boring to death super wannabe comic book film. Watching this, I was highly enjoyed, the movie was entertained, not bad at all, it was pretty good. Not boring, not to over long, I have enjoyed the hell out of this movie. It is awesome Action superhero comic book flick that does the job right! I am not a big comic book reader fan, I have not read Hulk comic books, but I did have watch the original TV show The Incredible Hulk (1977 - 1982) as a child. Been the biggest fan of that show, I know that in the TV show that, there was a reporter Jack McGee who was chasing Hulk trough the state, in this film Jack McGee is mentioned but as a journalist reporter student. Edward Norton did a solid job as Bruce Banner, he was even more convincing than Eric Bana. A massive improvement from the last movie. Edward Norton gets the character right all the way through. Eric Bana was the worst choice for playing the most iconic character Bruce Banner. The original bored me to hell, I will never watch it again. But this one I will it is my favorite flick alongside Iron Man 1 & 3, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor: The Dark World and Thor. Liv Tyler did amazing job as Betty Ross, but I still love Jennifer Connelly to death, I have enjoyed watching her in the Original flick Hulk. Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky/Abomination is great and fantastic in this flick, he was the most awesome villain in this film, unlike original who had none villain in the movie except David Banner (Nick Nolte). This movie has a heart and Edward Norton is the best, but Billy Bixby will be the only David Banner around here not Nick Nolte or Paul Kersey!:P. Lou Ferrigno was respectfully in this movie who has play the ""Hulk"" in the 70's TV Show, I have mentioned before he was also in Hulk (2003) original he played the same Security Guard that he have played here. I remember the scene where Bruce comes dressed as a pizza deliver boy on the campus and brings security guard a pizza, that security guard on university campus is Lou Ferrigno! I have recognized him immediately. Lou Ferrigno even voices Hulk, his first words where after the original film ""Betty"" where changed too: ""leave me alone"" and ""Hulk smash!"" really great lines. Right after Iron Man (2008) was finished and released out, Tony Stark (the always wonderfully charismatic Robert Downey Jr.) made a cameo scene on the end of credits towards Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross: (William Hurt). Director Louis Leterrier did a great solid job directing this fast paced action flick. He expressed interest in directing Iron Man but he couldn't because Jon Favreau was already MARVEL's first choice to direct the flick, but instead he was brought on board with writer Zak Penn who started to work on a loose sequel that would be much closer to the comics and the 1978 television series of the same name. And they both proved and did made a great solid job working together. Things I love about this film that work so great: The chemistry between Bruce (Edward Norton) and Betty (Liv Tylor) were great and amazing. The suspense, a c t i o n, drama, romance, comedy, special effects all perfectly blended to create this spectacular superhero flick. The hulk himself is portrayed as he should be. A rampaging monster with heart and a creature who is misunderstood. The fight scenes between Hulk and Abomination where really great, just like was in Iron Man movie, Hulk defeated Abomination but did not killed him, when Betty told him not too and she stopped him. The Incredible Hulk is the second feature film adaptation of the Marvel comic book series (the first being 2003's Hulk). Edward Norton stars as Bruce Banner, who goes into hiding as he tries to find a way to reverse the mutation that causes him to become the green beast. This film was directed by Louis Leterrier and is part of ""Phase One"" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that includes Iron Man, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger and culminated in 2012's The Avengers. The rating I am giving to this movie is 9, it is great superhero flick! I rather watch this than MARVEL Avengers, I will never watch them again! 9/10 Score: A Studio: Marvel Studios, Universal Pictures Starring: Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, William Hurt, Tim Blake Nelson, Ty Burrell Director: Louis Letterrier Producers: Avi Arad, Gale Anne Hurd, Kevin Feige Screenplay by Zak Penn Based on Hulk by Stan Lee Jack Kirby Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 1 Hr. 52 Mins.

"tedg","23 February 2009","I'm not sure what it is about Marvel comics that turns their movies into unsuccessful films. There's some profound consistency in the approach. It clearly originates in a specific concept of what the essence of comic books are about so what matters in translating to the screen.My theory is that Marvel had a fan base in the 60s and 70s (when the form we see was established). The fans and artists reinforced a style which was more spefically rooted in the comic books of the 30s before comics became essentially cinematic.I'm talking about superhero books here. DC was the first to become exclusively cinematic and the first to market that to TeeVee and Movies, which in this context are equivalent.It's precisely the uncinematic nature of Marvel that made them successful as books. The design of the panels is profoundly static. The postures and even the builds (which are the main defining characteristics here) are not derived from any stage. The physical humanness is deliberately removed so that the characters and stories can be more abstractly pure.It's the same crowd that is producing these movies. Unlike, say the Batman series where artists are given great freedom, this production shop controls the approach tightly. That's probably good for the brand, but it makes for pretty tepid movies. Oh, these can be as loud and colorful as the next guy's. But they will never have the power over the soul that  yes  the comics have.And gosh, if Liv Tyler's job is to just look appealing, why would they photograph her so poorly?Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.","

"Nytwolf","11 June 2008","For those that know only of the original comic book Hulk, the TV series Hulk, or the regrettable Ang Lee Hulk, you should know that this new version is a mixture of origins.Without spoiling it, one of the larger ingredients in this new Hulk comes from a Marvel series that is an alternate universe. There are many differences in the Ultimates Universe. In this version, Banner did not get his gamma radiation from exposure during an experimental bomb explosion. I won't spoil it, but you can go to www.marvel.com and look under ""Ultimates"" if you wish to get the gist of it. I can truly say that this version captures a little of everything, so that no matter what your knowledge is of the Hulk character, there's tie-ins to everything.Personally, I felt this reboot was well thought out. It allows for any future connectivity by not limiting it to one version of the Hulk. This will allow future Marvel movie-makers the ability to pick and choose aspects from the multitude of alternate universes, re-tellings, and time spans to combine whatever they please.This was well cast. When the overall product can make me forget the fact that I don't like a specific actor, and truly appreciate the total entertainment experience, it's something to smile about. I won't mention which one I don't care for, since all that will do is spark useless debate.Story - intricate and intelligent, fast-paced, yet deeply explanatory, complex, yet easily taken in by non-geeks. Enough references to the true comic, alternate comic, and TV show, that everyone in the sneak peek seemed to be pleased. I surely was.CGI was great. Don't know why some have to nit-pick, but you can't please everyone, I guess. Action was wonderful with plenty of it! If you've ever read one of my reviews, you'll know that I'm a true fan of overall entertainment. While I have favorites, I don't base reviews on just one actor, writer, director, production company, genre, or whatever. So, if you don't like my opinion, so be it.","

"the_headless_cross","15 June 2008","OK, I didn't think the 2003 Ang Lee version was THAT bad, but you ever figure out the faults of a movie when seeing the sequel/reboot to it? Now I do with Ang's version and after seeing the new improved Hulk I must say this is 100 times better! We see more of Bruce ""Hulking"" out and less of the drama the first showed to us. No more of Bruce blaming his father for what happened to him.Also this presents to us something else the first lacked: humor. OK, don't want the movie to be a total laugh fest, but nothing wrong with a little moments of laughter, such as some nods to the comic and TV show (the purple pants, and of course Lou's cameo, dang he's huge!). A little humor made Bruce seem like a real human rather than Eric Bana's deadpan performance.Speaking of, the cast, like the story, is redone and redone well. As I mentioned, Norton makes Bruce Banner more human. Nothing against Sam Elliot, but Hurt gives off a better presence as Thunderbolt Ross. Liv Tyler is easy on the eyes (she does have daddy's lips, but still hot), and easy on the performance as well. Tim Roth just owns as the villain here.The villain of course is the Abomination and what a sweet villain he is (better than the CG dogs and the Absorb Man). And believe me, the fight scene between him and our green friend will bring out the inner nerd in you. Oh, and hearing ""HULK SMASH!"" will too!Overall, more action than the 2003 ""drama"" and more humor leads to what we WANT a Hulk movie to be like. Oh, and don't forget to watch for a surprise cameo (hint: not Stan Lee or Lou) which hints at a possible cool movie event in the future!","

"Scarecrow-88","11 May 2009","Odd casting makes THE INCREDIBLE HULK, in my mind, an interesting feature film, a second attempt to right the wrongs of Ang Lee's HULK. Ultimately, as others in the past have mentioned, by the end, it turns into a video game duel between two monster titans with New York City(..a setting which seems to work quite well as a place where destruction occurs to such a devastating degree)the battleground as civilians, buildings, and transport vehicles are leveled in the process.A scrawny Ed Norton is cast as Bruce Banner, an innocent University student who thought he was testing a serum in regards to ""radiation resistance"", but his girlfriend Betty's(Live Tyler) military father, General Ross(William Hurt, wearing a hair piece and facial war scars) had actually tricked him..it's in fact a genetic experiment Bruce was injecting, therefore he suffers the horrifying side-effects. If Bruce's heart rate reaches a certain high point, upon excitement, he mutates into a gargantuan, muscular monster rampaging through those who dare to combat it. Tim Roth, in an unusual role, is a Russian(..raised in Britain)soldier Emil Blonsky, called in by Ross to find Bruce, soon injecting him with formulas which enhance his recuperative powers and combative skills. Blonsky embraces a difficult opponent, enjoys a challenge, and yearns for the same ability(..to become an unstoppable force like the green hulk)Bruce has. Tim Blake Nelson(..who I think steals the entire film from everyone who shares the screen with him)is a, energetic, unflappable NYC scientist, Samuel Sterns, who Bruce has contacted over the internet regarding his specific condition, looking for a cure that can kill the beast within(..he looks at it as a disease).Actually, my favorite part of the film was the thrilling chase through Rio de Janeiro, as Bruce attempts to escape his pursuers, military men led by Blonsky and Ross, leaping across roof tops and into crowded streets..it's quite exciting like a Bourne actioner. The action sequence within a juice bottle factory as unfriendly Brazilian co-workers bring the dormant hulk out from hiding, as Blonsky's men close in, is a stunner. Norton and Tyler really have good chemistry and their characters' romance isn't overwrought. Hurt isn't as intense or angered as Sam Elliot's version in Lang's film..he's more methodical and cold-blooded. Roth is pure machismo and menace. You can see that he lives for combat against an enemy. The Abomination character is quite hideous with it's deformities(..obviously thanks to those ill-advised injections which basically fed more fuel to an adrenaline junkie who covets competition). Great cameos featuring Lou Ferrigno(..still has bulging muscles)and Stan Lee(..the unfortunate who drinks a ""tainted"" juice containing Bruce's blood!)..nice tribute to Bill Bixby as well. Quite a lengthly battle sequence within a college campus between Hulk and Ross' soldiers, using all the weaponry and tanks at their disposal. As expected, the film is effects-heavy at times with Bruce staying active on the run, a fugitive who gains an ally in Betty(..who sternly disagrees with her father's operation)along the way. Norton is among an interesting crop of fine multi-talented A-listers assuming the role of hero in Summer Blockbusters.","

"Bunuel1976","6 July 2008","I recall disliking the overblown, gimmicky and far too somber HULK (2003); even if the creature’s leaping skills were a staple of the original comic (an animated series of which from the 1960s I used to watch as a kid), I found them especially silly in the live-action version – thankfully, here, they’re relegated to the very end. Anyway, when this was first announced, I had little faith that it would be any good: at first, I even doubted Edward Norton’s suitability for the lead but, seeing him in action as Dr. Bruce Banner, he brings the right elements of intelligence, paranoia, tenacity and anguish to the role (his relationship with Betty Ross – nicely played by the luscious Liv Tyler – is very moving, making for one of the more compelling couples in this type of film).As for the Hulk himself, I’m still reeling from the ultra-fake look of the CGI technique: I know having a body-builder painted green (like Lou Ferrigno was in the popular TV series from the 1970s I’m also familiar with) wouldn’t cut the mustard in this day and age of blockbuster movies filled with large-scale gratuitous mayhem…but when the alternative is so unsatisfactory?! Incidentally, it was nice of the film-makers to acknowledge both actors from that earlier incarnation: the late Bill Bixby (the original Bruce…er…David Banner) appears in a bit from one of his other TV series on Brazilian TV(!), while Ferrigno is the lab guard whom Norton bribes with a pizza(!)…not to mention the character’s creator, Stan Lee (he has become a staple of these modern renditions of his work), who’s the old man infected with Banner’s blood at one point.Another definite strong point to the film is the performance by Tim Roth: his typically riveting intensity makes up for the deficiencies of the character as written – so that he’s believable nevertheless as both a man of action and one who’s curious about the possibilities of science (as always, both the experts in the field and the military callously want to use the techniques to their own selfish ends rather than in the service of humanity); even more importantly, he’s an ideal adversary for both Banner and Hulk (when he’s himself transformed into the so-called Abomination). On the other hand, William Hurt disappointingly (I should say, lazily) hams it up in his one-dimensional role of the cigar-chomping General – one can’t help smiling at his apparent ability to summon all the heavy artillery employed in the pursuit of The Hulk at the bat of an eyelid!; having come to his senses by the end, he is seen taking a drink at a bar when he receives a visit from one Tony Stark… The action is the slam-bang, give-‘em-all-you-‘ve-got routine we’ve come to expect in this form of mass entertainment – which, after a while, begins to look all the same (especially in the way Hulk seems to be impervious to practically anything they can throw at him!); besides, Abomination seems to throw in the towel all-too-easily during their showdown (I guess being a monster in love gave The Hulk greater motivation). Since romance in the usual sense isn’t possible because Banner’s accelerated heartbeat would constitute another transformation into the green giant, we get a bit of King Kong tenderness between Tyler and The Hulk himself in a cave but which, thankfully, isn’t carried on too far.I’d never heard of French director Leterrier: looking at his brief resume' on IMDb, it seems he was chosen for this on the strength of his work on the actioner TRANSPORTER 2 (2005)! – he does seem to have an annoying preponderance for sweeping “helicopter” (crane/overhead) shots. In any case, his next film, looks like it’ll be another remake – this time of the Ray Harryhausen mythological opus CLASH OF THE TITANS (1981) which, for what it’s worth, had featured extensive shooting in Malta!!","

"YoSafBridge","16 June 2008","Three cheers for Marvel for finally realizing that no one knows their material better then themselves. May they never sell another beloved superhero to a lesser being again.For the second time this summer Marvel has given us a superhero movie that just plain rocks. With the exact right amount of humour, character development and great action sequences, the Incredible Hulk is up there with Iron Man as one of my favourite films to be released so far in the summer movie season. While I didn't like it quite as much as Iron Man (Robert Downey WAS Tony Stark. Whereas something still doesn't sit right about Edward Norton as Bruce...) it was nevertheless a great, faithful adaptation of the comic books. Plus the cameo appearances by both Stan Lee and Robert Downey Jr where terrific! Possibly my favourite Stan Lee cameo yet.There isn't really much else to say besides, go see it for yourselves. If you're a fan of the comics, or just of fun popcorn films you'll definitely enjoy this one.8/10","

"aharmas","15 June 2008","At first, I wondered why they were releasing this ""adaptation"" so quickly after the Ang Lee version. I hadn't recovered from that disappointment and didn't have much confidence the new movie would get it right, either. It was specially daunting, coming right behind ""Ironman"", but there some intriguing variables, most importantly, the fact that Edward Norton was playing our doomed scientist. Finally, I must admit that the new ""Hulk"" is everything a film of this genre should be: exciting, interesting, very nice to look, showing a range of emotions, and most importantly, it leaves you hoping there is a sequel really soon! The excitement never lets up in this one. From the introduction of the ""hulk"" when the original experiment goes awry. Later on, other pieces come together, and we understand how each of the participants contributed to the tragic transformation of our hero. It is the trademark of a good screenwriter than he is able to create multidimensional characters, without relying too much on narration or extended dialog pieces. Most of the information is delivered visually, through montages, and a couple of lines placed at the right moment in key scenes to recall past events. Some of the film is even told in a foreign language, and it doesn't seem to matter because it completes that particular chapter and adds truth to the scene.In addition to being exciting, the film is a pleasure to watch, as we follow our hero through his odyssey from Brazil to Guatemala and back to the states. Great camera work adds plenty of mood to each scene. The director and cinematographer have seamless added special effects to a beautifully shot movie. Gone were my reservations about the look of the ""monster"" in the first film. This time, the new hulk is able to project his emotions without calling much attention to the FX. The Hulk is actually capable of showing a range of emotions ranging from desperation to anger, and it touches us.It is also refreshing to see a love story in the middle of this action fantasy film. It gives every character a much need dimension that is usually missing from this type of adventures. The lovely Liv Tyler has amazing chemistry with Norton and fully supports the main character as he moves through his adventures.And let's not forget that final scene... if i was craving a sequel from its opening scene, I couldn't restrain myself from gasping when I saw the guest star who shows up at the last minute to exchange a few words with the William Hurt character. I'm dying to see what happens next.","

"SonicStuart","17 September 2008","The Incredible HulkStarring: Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, William Hurt, Tim Blake Nelson and Tim Roth including a special appearance by Robert Downey Jr.Genre: Action/Sci-Fi/ThrillerRated PG-13I hated the 2003 Hulk movie, but I'm glad that this movie turned out better and made up for it and not to mention Edward Norton gets to play the title role and you can't go wrong with Edward Norton. Plus this movie got a chance to start the series over again from the right foot considering this movie is a reboot but yet a loose sequel. So basically, Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is hiding out in Brazil trying to control his anger and finding a cure to get rid of his inner beast while General Ross (William Hurt) is still trying to capture him and trying to stop Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) as he goes out of control and becomes Abomination. I liked it how this movie decided to take only a few minutes of the movie to show us how Bruce Banner became The Incredible Hulk unlike that 03 movie that took an hour to explain how Bruce became The Incredible Hulk. I also liked how they put in a lot of chase scenes in this movie like the chase scene in Brazil made it look like ""The Bourne Identity"". Plus the fight scenes were good too and they made a good choice to choose a villain that's more of The Hulk's size and strength. Edward Norton also did a good job writing this movie too, he never fails to do a good movie, I hope he does another Incredible Hulk movie or at least make an appearance in ""The Avengers"" movie. Not to also mention that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) gets to make a special appearance. Overall this movie was totally better and made up for the damage that Ang Lee did.","

"Floated2","3 May 2019","The Incredible Hulk starring Edward Norton is quite easily an upgrade over Ang Lee's Hulk released in 2003 for several reasons. Having watched both films right after one another, it is clear this version is superior.First off Edward Norton's performance as Bruce Banner is more convincing than Eric Bana as he shows much more emotion and range as Banner, and is easier to root for. Same with Liv Tyler, as she is quite easily an upgrade over Jennifer Connelly's Betty Ross.More action and this film doesn't feel as forced as the 2003 version. Also more humor and some unintentional funny moments for comic relief.This film also doesn't drag its plot along and doesn't have the same abusive father storyline with flashbacks. It gets right into the story and immediately becomes quite thrilling and entertaining.The CGI of the Hulk looked better all around. The battle scene at the end was a good watch.","

"Critomaton","13 July 2008","Somebody owes Ang Lee an apology. Actually, a lot of people do. And I'll start. I was never interested in the Ang Lee film Hulk, because of the near unanimous bad reviews. Even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it. I finally decided to watch it yesterday on USA network and, wow....SPOILERS FOR ANG LEE'S HULK AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK Was it boring! I almost didn't make it through Ang Lee's Hulk. Eric Bana was expressionless, Nick Nolte was horrible, Sam Elliott was unlikeable (and that's no fun, he's usually a cool character). In fact, I honestly think they chose Eric Bana because his non-descript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics - and it was clear that the Ang Lee Hulk was meant to facially resemble Bruce Banner in his non-angry state. When Hulk fought a mutant poodle I was ready to concede Hulk as the worst superhero movie ever.But then something happened. About 3/4 of the way through this tedious movie, there was a genuinely exciting and - dare I say it - reasonably convincing - extended action scene that starts with Hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base, fighting M1 tanks and Comanche helicopters in the desert, then riding an F22 Raptor into the stratosphere, only to be captured on the streets of San Francisco. This was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie. And I have to say, the CGI was quite good. That's not to say that the Hulk was totally convincing. But it didn't require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non-superhero action movies. And that's quite a feat.Of course, the ending got really stupid with Bruce Banner's father turning into some sort of shape-shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of Iron Man's brief heroics to shame. And overall, apart from the animated mutant dogs, it really did seem like the CGI in Hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment. It was certainly better than I expected.OK, but what about The Incredible Hulk? Guess what... It's boring too! It has just a few appearances by the Hulk and here's the thing - the CGI in this movie is horrible. Maybe the Hulk in Ang Lee's version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others - but it had its convincing moments also. The Incredible Hulk looked positively ridiculous. It had skin tone and muscle tone that didn't even look like a living creature, just some sort of computer-generated texture. It was really preposterous. The lighting, environment and facial effects didn't look 5 years newer than Ang Lee's, they looked 10 years older. And there really is no excuse for that. We truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director, actor or cinematographer ever could.Worse, the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from Ang Lee's ""failure"". All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is practically emotionless. The general is so relentlessly, implausibly one-dimensional that he seems faker than the Hulk. The love interest is unconvincing (I have to give Liv Tyler credit for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, though both are quite easy on the eyes). Tim Blake Nelson overacts almost as much as Nick Nolte, even though he's only in the movie for a few minutes. The Hulk really doesn't do much in this movie, certainly not any more than in Ang Lee's version. The Incredible Hulk was slightly more fast-paced, but since nothing really happened anyway that's not worth much. Oh yeah, the villain is every bit as phony looking as the Hulk. He's actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster. This is how I can definitively say Ang Lee's version was better: if I ever have the chance to see Ang Lee's version again, I might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences, or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more (more likely I'd just fast forward to the good parts). But there is absolutely not a single scene in The Incredible Hulk that is worth seeing once, let alone twice. It is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies. The cartoonish CGI is an insult to the audience - at least in Ang Lee's version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic (except for the giant poodle, of course).It is absolutely mind-boggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee's Hulk by making almost exactly the same movie. It is to Edward Norton's credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film.","

"StarkTech","8 June 2008","What a summer Marvel is having! Iron Man hitting big was great but Incredible Hulk may even top it. I caught a pre-screening and I can assure everyone that the Hulk delivers more action and maybe more fun. If you are concerned that this film is another Ang Lee type misfire, don't be. It's about 100 times better then the version of five years ago. Unlike the Ang Lee effort, it's presented in a way that can be savored. The pacing is perfect and the action is relentlessly awesome. What's amazing is that they managed to play both sides perfectly. It's far deeper then I would've thought given the subject matter. Each frame is packed with action, emotion, drama or intensity. I was expecting to see a crazy green giant destroying the landscape and fighting another crazy green monster for two hours. I was shocked at the complexity of this movie. Given Edward Norton's involvement, I don't know why I'm so surprised. The action is certainly there but the tone is perfect, a mix of the TV flavor with all the action from the comic books. Hulk does indeed ""smash"" but it's more then just dumb action with no plot. It truly is an all around exceptional film. Also, I'm amazed at how far the CGI came since the first teaser trailer. This remarkable CGI works very well and it offers the chance to savor a complete movie going experience without being pulled out of the film. This trimmed downed Hulk looks perfect and his opponent is truly frightening. The final battle between the two will go down in movie history as one of the greatest fights of all-time. Overall, a summer movie that's superior to everything else that I've seen this year, with the possible exception of Iron Man. Again, who would've thought that Marvel would be a perfect two for two this summer? Speaking of Iron Man (*Beware SPOILER*) Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) does indeed show up at the end of the film(they cut from Banner and that green eyed smile we've all seen in the TV ads right to the Stark scene and the hairs on your neck will stand up)","

"isabelle1955","19 June 2008","I have to admit that the only reason we went to see this movie was because we couldn't quite believe that Edward Norton had made it. Norton is an interesting and hugely talented actor, and as far as I'm concerned he's never made a bad film. I loved him in Keeping the Faith, in American History X (an intensely powerful film), in Fight Club, in The Painted Veil, in The Illusionist.. the list goes on. And he seems to have resisted over exposure in the media, which makes him all the more interesting. Cute too And the main reason this adaptation of The Incredible Hulk works is because of Norton. He brings such intense vulnerability and credibility to the role of Bruce Banner that the audience is filled with sympathy for the guy right from the start, which keeps us interested even through the fairly predictable special effects scenes where Banner becomes the Green Eyed monster /hero of the title and smashes everything in sight. I haven't seen any of the other iterations of this comic book character beyond a half watched TV episode or two many years back, so I can't make valid comparisons to Ang Lee's version and must review it as an entity by itself. But I thought this film extremely well cast, well written (Zak Penn) and well put together. It was a very pleasant surprise, as I hadn't expected much of it. Comparing this incarnation of The Hulk to the 4th Indiana Jones movie which I saw a couple of weeks ago, is pretty easy. This is a vastly superior film in every way. The opening sequences of the chase through the Brazilian favela are extremely well done; we get a real feel for the claustrophobic narrowness of the streets and the tough life of the inhabitants, as Banner runs for his life from the US Special Forces team who want to capture him for weapons research. I was gripped. I was interested. I was convinced. I wanted him to escape and I was totally drawn in. I thought this was one of the better chase scenes I've seen recently in a movie. Contrast that to the yawn inducing car chases in Indy 4, where I glanced at my watch thinking ""How much more can they possibly string this out?"" Back in the USA Banner hooks up with ex girlfriend Betty Ross (Liv Tyler in the best role I've seen her in for a long time. The female love interest in an action movie isn't going to win anyone an Oscar nomination, but she made the most of it) and their scenes are played out with a surprising degree of tenderness and occasional humour (anger isn't the only thing to raise Bruce's pulse rate). Surprising? Well yes. These special effects driven films are not usually noted for their convincing emotional content. This was well done without  I hope  alienating the young male audience who seem to be the Holy Grail for Hollywood producers. William Hurt's villainous General Ross was matched only by Tim Roth's wicked and egotistical Emil Blonsky who morphs into The Abomination, a guy who makes The Hulk look cuddly. I enjoyed it from start to finish, and it came in briskly at a little under 2 hours rather than the obligatory 3 hours which nowadays seems to turn every action movie into cinematic purgatory. Good stuff!","

"ccthemovieman-1","23 October 2008","I found this very entertaining and better than anticipated. Some folks might find it a big slow going in the first half hour but I enjoyed the colors and South American scenery during that time. I also enjoyed the acting of Edward Norton, who usually excels in whatever roles he plays. When the ""Hulk"" appears, it's pretty awesome even thought its also pretty obvious how computer-generated it looks....but who cares? The Green Monster might not have looked as realistic as the TV days when Lou Ferrigno was the big guy, but it looked very cool because of its size. If you enjoyed ""The Sandman"" in the last Spiderman movie, you'll enjoy this XXX-L version of the Hulk, too.In the finale, you can get to watch two monsters going at each other which has the typical overdone action but still fun to watch action. As for the story, once again, it's the same old/same old bash-the-U.S. Armed Forces. Who are the two villains in this movie: two military officers! The military, especially since the early '60s beginning with ""Dr. Strangelove,"" has always been the left-leading Hollywood's prime target.I did a little homework on the Hulk comic book origins and, yes, the police and army were trying subdue the green monster, but only because of the destruction he was causing. In this movie, however, they aren't too subtle. The main ""soldier,"" played by William Hurt, ""Gen. Thaddeus 'Thunderebolt' Ross,"" is shown to be a heartless killer with the usual let's-make-a-super-weapon attitude and not-care-about-anything else. His nickname ought to tell you something. Making the military look like evil dummies is nothing new, either, with screenwriters the past half century. In this particular Hulk film, one of Banner's allies, "" Dr. Samuel Sterns,"" (Tim Blake Nelson) even admits ""I hate the government."" Of course he does. Anyone in authority is always the villain in today's movies. This film is a good example of that kind of thinking. The other weirdo (Tim Roth) has the rank of ""Major.""Other than that, and the always-annoying Liv Tyler, who plays ""Bety,"" the female love interest of Banner's, this was a very enjoyable and entertaining film. Norton is a credible and likable ""Bruce Banner"" and Roth is one of the best in the business at playing whacked-out villains. He plays the Major and winds up as the second ""monster"" and he's a real hoot! Hurt is a fine actor, too, as movie fans know.One thing filmmakers do these days that I think is very nice is to pay tribute to the old actors who were in these stories years ago, either in film or on television. Here, there is a nice cameo scene by Ferrigno, who still looks in great shape, by the way. The former bodybuilder who was the green monster in the TV series that starred Bill Bixby, has a few lines in here as a security guard that will make you smile. I'm sure they would have had Bixby in this movie, too, had the man been alive. In the recent Superman film, ""Superman Returns,"" we saw Jack Larsen and Noel Neill, who played Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane, respectively, on the 1950s ""Adventures of Superman"" TV series. This has been done in a few other movies, too.The ending to this film also was clever and tied in with another recently-issued movie. That's all I'll say because I don't want to spoil the surprise. It makes me anticipate what's on the horizon. Overall, this film was fun to watch and I definitely would view it again.","

"bkoganbing","1 July 2008","With The Incredible Hulk Edward Norton can now take his place in the superhero genre besides such contemporaries as Tobey Maguire, Robert Downey, Jr., and Ben Affleck all of whom have played comic book superheroes. It's the in thing to do in Hollywood these days and I have to say the films for the most part make money.When we meet Norton he's living in obscurity in Brazil trying to control his emotions because the experiment that turned him into the green guy have already gone horribly wrong. Norton is scientist Bruce Banner who made the mistake of experimenting on himself. Now if you get him mad it's not a pretty sight both to look at him and to see what he can do.General William Hurt wants him back at any price. His scientist daughter Liv Tyler wants Norton back as well. She's carrying a Statue of Liberty size torch for Norton who when he's in Hulk mode would use that torch as a matchstick.To track down the Hulk, William Hurt has imported a real bad dude from the British Royal Marines in Tim Roth. At some point Hurt decided he'd like a lot of what Norton has and of course the final confrontation is with them. I'm still not sure why we had to import him from the United Kingdom, but the match between them reminded me of Andre the Giant versus Big John Studd back in the glory days of the WWF.Though the cast looked like they were having a good time, I'm not sure The Incredible Hulk gets beyond the comic book stage. TV's famous Doctor Banner, Bill Bixby made a cameo appearance via a clip from another old series of his, The Courtship of Eddie's Father. And when the late Mr. Bixby was in Hulk mode he was Lou Ferrigno who plays a small bit as a security guard who can be bribed with pizza.If this film succeeds I'm sure there will be a sequel, in fact one was kind of set up during this film. Let's see if we get to explore that in the next Incredible Hulk film.","

"Bruce722","26 May 2013","Though I'm not a big fan of Edward Norton he does a great job in this movie. It's darker and more emotional and dramatic than most superhero movies and I think that fits in well with the Bruce Banner tragic story. Liv Tyler is as angelic as usual and Tim Roth and William Hurt round out a great cast. The action sequences were done really well and I loved all of the little nods to the Hulk lore like the Lou Ferrigno cameo, the purple pants scene, the Stan Lee cameo, and the name of their old time friend ""Stanley"" being a nod to the creator. The plot also developed really well. The only negative was that the fight sequence at the end with abomination was a little anticlimactic. That fight is being hyped up the entire film and I just didn't think it was that great. Nonetheless, this was an outstanding movie and most people would enjoy it.","

"bob the moo","15 October 2008","Dr David Banner is hiding out in Brazil having fled the military unit led by General Ross who wish to study his genetic mutation and utilise it to create a race of super soldiers. Banner continues his studies into a possible cure for his condition with the discrete help of the mysterious scientist Mr Blue. A slip up in the bottling plant that Banner works alerts Ross to his presence and in goes a small unit led by Major Blonsky to tranquilise him and take him into custody. However when Blonsky and his men trap Banner in the plant, Banner's pulse races and soon Blonsky learns firsthand why Banner is such an important asset to Ross.The Incredible Hulk was sold as more of a blockbuster experience than the Ang Lee film was and from the very start this approach is laid out in the rapid back story in the credits. This continues across the whole film with some good sequences, comic book references for the fans and plenty of impressive special effects. What that does for you will depend on you but for my money it produced a solid summer blockbuster which is much like Iron Man in construction  ie it doesn't pretend to have ""substance"" or complexity in the way the Batman franchise reboot does. Instead it is all about the basic blocks that make up the film and delivering those in a way that is fun without being too demanding or too complex. Hulk delivers on this and has plenty of good action that are greatly helped by the effects being very good indeed, with the decisions made about the look and size of the Hulk working to stop it being silly. Without a doubt it is a ""money up there on the screen"" sort of affair.Having said that though, essentially this does mean that the film comes down to big computer effects hitting one another with New York City taking its traditional summer-time pasting and it did make me wonder about Norton's involvement. I respect him a lot as an actor and his scenes do appear to suggest that he sees more in the material than comes across on the screen. As it is he must have spent more of his time doing motion capture than doing on-screen acting and while his presence suggests that he has ideas of depth, nothing worthy of him is forthcoming. The opposite is true of Tyler, who is perfect for this material-light film but is not still that impressive. Roth was a strange bit of casting but he works in his character and is convincing in his transformation. Hurt and Nelson are both good additions who I assume more will come from. The cameos are not too obtrusive (although why can't Stan Lee do more of background cameo) and it is really hard for me to fault a film that gives a bit of time for Williams  who even in ""normal"" clothes as he was here will always be Omar from The Wire.The Incredible Hulk is not a particularly dark or interesting film but, like Iron Man it is a fun and energetic comic-book film with good effects, good action and a general sense of good humour running through it. It won't blow you away outside of the realms of being a summer blockbuster but for what it does it is a perfectly enjoyable film.","

"pyrocitor","17 June 2008","When acclaimed director Ang Lee's cerebral take on comic book antihero the Hulk hit screens in 2003, the reaction was hardly a positive one. Fans of the comic books fumed over the script straying from its source material, whereas critics and audiences alike mused over the effectiveness of the philosophical ruminations in lieu of crowd pleasing action sequences. All of the above criticisms appear to have been taken by Marvel Studios (now producing their own franchises) in stride, revamping and continuing the green behemoth's tale with a more enjoyable, action packed focus and a quality cast. And while The Incredible Hulk may not quite live up to the no holds barred action epic its premise promised, it proves a satisfyingly bombastic smackdown to appease both fans of the comics and audiences alike. The inherent imbalance in the script lends credulity to rumours of creative disputes between Edward Norton's influence and that of the studio. While opening sequences detailing Banner's fugitive life in Brazil prove breathless, tense and tremendously gripping, taking more than a few notes from the Bourne series, upon returning to the United States, the promising start lags, as continual run ins with the military become increasingly repetitive and unoriginal, with the raucous fun of the periodic Hulk battles now saddled with a flimsy romantic subplot, entirely failing to compliment the intrigue. Here the script begins to falter, tripping over itself during certain crucial emotional moments with contrived lines and confusingly stilted character motivations, while the sidelining of certain characters initially presented as major players (most noticeably Ty Burell's Doc Sampson) reeks of hasty last minute cuts. By the film's obligatory big loud climax, it becomes clear that the creative reigns have shifted - all the prior gritty realism has vanished, replaced with a more conventional and less enjoyable action finish. As the occasional throwaway comic moments (some more effective than others) prevent the film from descending in the realm of melodramatic self importance, the film's primary redeeming factor emerges - despite the steady descent into excess stupidity, it is never afraid to have some fun, the quality Ang Lee's incarnation sorely lacked. Of course, the primary draw for superhero blockbusters is seldom the screen writing, and Transporter director Louis Leterrier's unapologetic ""smash first talk later"" approach does generate some exhilarating action sequences, but the increasingly unimaginative fight choreography and relative sparsity of action setpieces for an action focused film detracts from the glorious destruction that could have been, the attempted juxtaposition of emotional intensity only slowing the gleeful mayhem. Thankfully, after the paltry CGI in Ang Lee's effort, special effects have been amped up to make this new, grittier Hulk about as close to feasibly photo real as one could hope for, bearing an uncanny resemblance to Norton himself, though certain fluctuating details (the Hulk appears smaller or less muscular at various points) give the impression of patchy continuity, and the movement of both Hulk and monstrous adversary The Abomination appears too mechanically humanoid to properly capture the otherworldly feel of gargantuan muscular mutations - nonetheless, an impressive and exhilarating effort overall. Despite the laudable use of quality actors over conventional blockbuster stars, even the astutely talented performers prove they can only do so much with such a steadily flimsy script. Edward Norton of course proves the exception, his passion for the project and standard blistering intensity making tortured protagonist Bruce Banner a truly fleshed out and tragic character. Burning with nobility and pathos, his plight genuinely moving and his battle with the monster raging inside of him truly gripping, Norton truly convinces in the crucial role. In contrast, Liv Tyler is saddled with an embarrassing nothing of a role, exemplifying the worst aspects of comic book love interests, with nothing to do but scream the hero's name and stand around statuesquely looking worried - it is a shame to see such a normally talented actress descend to such banality. Tim Roth similarly suffers, infusing tragically two-dimensional antagonist Emil Blonsky with all the steely menace and petty arrogance and ambition he can muster, but his quality is still diminished by the overwhelming predictability of his role. William Hurt is appropriately grim as obsessive general ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, thankfully eschewing the scene chomping which could have resulted all too easily, and Tim Blake Nelson delivers a bout of much needed irreverent goofiness as overeager scientist Samuel Sterns, his brief but enjoyable role hinting at a larger character progression in any ensuing films. Finally, the film's slew of enjoyable cameos do not disappoint, from comical Stan Lee and Lou Ferringo appearances to the highly anticipated Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man lead Tony Stark, a fitting and classy way of bridging the gap between superhero franchises as well as planting further seeds for the upcoming Avengers film. While the film may disappointingly fall short of its true potential, comic book fans can breathe a hearty sigh of relief that the green behemoth has been firmly returned to his less philosophical and more action filled roots. If nothing else, Leterrier's more singular vision is laudable, never losing track of its true intent: even during the fumbling between dramatic clout and exhilarating action, the film never fails to entertain. While the superb cast may flounder with underwritten characters, Norton's incendiary lead performance and the enthusiastic action sequences make The Incredible Hulk a solid edition into the realm of guilt-free summer entertainment - despite the criticisms, Hulk finally smashes. -7/10","

"ametaphysicalshark","16 June 2008","Damning with faint praise or not, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is far superior to Ang Lee's 2003 effort ""Hulk"", if only for its opening hour. The film opens with one of the best opening credit sequences I've seen in a while, a hook that immediately grabs the viewer. Many of the following scenes are also superb, with director Louis Leterrier handling the early scenes superbly well, and the first appearance of the Hulk in this movie is among its best scenes. In general, Bruce Banner in South America is far more interesting than Bruce Banner back home.Back home Bruce Banner is chased, gets angry, turns into the Hulk, and destroys stuff. Oh, there's a poorly-handled and rushed love story as well. Liv Tyler is the most criticized aspect of this film in general but I found her performance effective. Then again, I'm one of the idiots who believes she should be in more major films. In general the acting here is superb all around with Norton being especially effective in the lead role, which he handles far better than Eric Bana did.""The Incredible Hulk"" stops being very interesting around when the film turns from an absorbing and entertaining science fiction film into a bunch of excuses for the big ol' green fellow to destroy things. At least that's how this film feels in its latter half, and instead of being entertained I'm watching a solid script deteriorate rapidly.Of course, ""The Incredible Hulk"" could turn out to be something of a comic book-to-film masterpiece when we get to see the original cut of the film that Leterrier and Norton wanted. From what we've seen thus far it is definitely clear that had this film gone the contemplative drama route it would have worked much better than Lee's ""Hulk"". Could the added minutes that we might get on DVD help this film reach its potential? I don't know. Until then, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a good summer flick worth watching but not much more. See it for the best-realized Hulk in any live action version thus far.6.5/10","

"ThatDoesntMatter","23 September 2010","Action without story is boring.A film with a bad script is boring, it can even be painful and anger-inducing...;-) A film with mostly good actors in it (good in other films..!!) that of course cannot save the film, as the script is so baaaaaaaaad!!! I like Ed Norton and I liked him in this, little as there was...I rejoiced at seeing Bill Bixby, Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno, nice touch for fans, of course not important for the film.Chase scene through favela - watch City of God. Though at that point I was still interested, nice cinematography, okay plot.Then they shoot the dog - bad move in my book, I'm annoyed.Then they chase Bruce in the factory....and chase....and chase...oops, I thought - you're losing me!! THEN they don't really show the Hulk - what, like we don't know that Bruce turns into him? Like, trying to make it more exciting, he's like Alien on the spaceship? At that point I started to be bored.Sadly, nothing much interesting happened after that. In fact, totally dim-witted things happened after that. Tim Roth: Military man with long hair. William Hurt (whom I adore!): Almost more stupid than that military guy in Avatar. Liv Tyler: Unconvincing, looking over-concerned and distressed or soppy.The most intelligent pieces of dialogue were the computer chats...;-))) Why don't they talk about the last five years AT ALL? Oh, he's there, oh, I'm shocked and happy, oh, you come with me. But we only chitchat.Too much military for me. Mostly quickly coming out of bushes exactly when needed, sadly totally useless...oh my...No, this was not for me. I had thought this really might be about how Bruce learns to harness his powers, but that is only hinted at. The scene in the lab is just stupid.3 points because I really like Ed. I even like the Hulk, but not this one.","

"kaden_lewis","11 June 2021","I can't believe how underrated this movie is. IMDb currently has this at a 6.7/10. This movie deserves a 7.5/10 minimum (There was no 7.5 option, I rounded up to 8). The entire movie was good, especially the first half. I really liked the plot of the first half of the movie where Bruce has to go into hiding in the Brazilian Favelas. Then the US military came to get him, but he turned into The Hulk and got away all the way to Guatemala. He then slowly made his way up through Mexico and back into the United States. The next little bit of the movie gets a little boring, but then we have he final battle scene, and it was great.This was overall, a great film, I honestly recommend watching it. The only thing that sucks was that there was no sequel, they set it up perfectly for one, but it never happened.","

"Rxblinkboy","8 June 2008","Honestly, as soon as I heard they were making another Hulk movie I was surprised. When I heard they had cast Ed Norton, I was shocked. So going into this movie I had no idea what to expect. Coming out, I feel like an idiot because it was really masterfully done. Lettier does an amazing job, Norton was fantastic, and as far as a comic book movie goes, this one is just about on top with little nods and mentions. If you don't walk out of this film screaming HELLL YEAAAA, then you are not normal. Far better than Ang Lee's attempt at the green man and as far as this year, it's definitely Marvel's year. No better way to make up for Spiderman 3 than releasing Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk just a month apart. Thank you Marvel for cleaning the mess Spiderman 3 left and clearing your name. This film just makes me thing of one word...AVENGERS","

"ElijahCSkuggs","16 June 2008","Well Marvel fans, it's time for the unofficial sequel to Ang Lee's HULK, and this time...it's a darker more menacing looking Hulk that is unleashed.The Hulk, and the awesome special FX that bring him to life have made the mean green machine as ripped, shredded, and jacked to the most ultimate degree. I'm pretty sure the FX guys created muscles to add onto the Hulk's already massive build.The beginning is actually the most solid part of the film, as the filmmakers do a very nice job of showing the lengths Dr. Banner has went to in order to steady his excitement factor. Though moving to Brazil  a country fraught with smoking hot babes  and working in a factory  with all sorts of dangerous equipment  might not be the best choice.Of course the sh!t hits the fan and Banner is forced to leave South America and head home. Once he arrives home, he meets up with the sexy Liv Tyler and plans to meet a fellow scientist who may be able to cure his affliction. But General Ross and Emil Blonsky have different ideas, and make it very difficult for Banner to do anything...without getting very, very irritated.The Abomination is revealed at the film's climax and the action that fills the film is monstrous to say the least. Big explosions, big punches, and big roars fill this movie! So why is it a little disappointing? The writing is not very good, the FX wane, dumb choices are made, and it seemed rushed at times.Why is it good? Very mean looking Hulk. He is truly a monster. And because of the Abomination, and Tim Roth. Roth will always play a great bad guy.So you see, this film is pretty damn good. But I thought the first was also pretty damn good (better as a comic book stylized film), so..see it for your self.ALSO: It has the best cameo of the year by ease. No not Stan Lee. None other than Rickson Gracie as Banner's Aikido teacher. Nuff' said!!!","

"Grant_Price","15 June 2008","Out of the five original Avengers, I always thought that the Incredible Hulk was the least interesting and therefore least likely character to be adapted to film (except Ant-Man, although he'll be arriving in 2010...look forward to that.) However, here we sit in 2008 with not just one, but TWO different portrayals of the less-than-jolly green giant. The main problem that the new film faces is that some people will believe it to be a sequel to Ang Lee's 2003 effort, which upon release was blindfolded, made to stand against a wall and executed by public firing squad. The fact is that it is not a sequel at all. Instead, director Louis Leterrier has pulled a 'Batman Begins' and rebooted the franchise, and not just in name only. Everything about the 'Hulk is excellent. From the special effects to the characters to the reticent nods to other superheroes within the Marvel universe, the 'Hulk succeeds on every level.The film sidesteps the curse of the tedious 'origin story' by showing it to the audience in the opening credits. That should really be a law within superhero movies. It works so well: Bruce Banner works on a radioactive serum with love interest/scientist Betty Ross (played by Liv Tyler's lips), he injects himself to see if it works, it transforms him into the Hulk. There, that didn't need to take one hundred minutes of screen time did it? This means that director Leterrier has free reign to explore how Bruce Banner lives as the Hulk and the attempts by the United States army to track him down and neutralise him, which leads to several action set pieces involving vehicles being thrown into walls and soldiers firing a nimiety of bullets at the Hulk, even when they can clearly see them bouncing off his body. Really, what is the best they are hoping for in a situation like that? ""Keep firing, he might develop a vague sense of moral ill-being and stop!"" Ultimately, the film boils down to a brawl in New York City between the Hulk and his evil counterpart, a special-ops soldier (Tim Roth being exemplary as usual) willingly injected with the Hulk genes, much like the climax to 'Iron Man.' The difference here is that the build up to this fight doesn't seem rushed like in 'Iron Man' because Leterrier has been able to utilise the whole of the film's running time to arrive at this natural conclusion, instead of being preoccupied with the origin story and tagging on an antagonist at the end.Whoever cast Edward Norton as Dr Bruce Banner is almost as much of a genius as the person who asked Robert Downey Jr. To play Tony Stark in 'Iron Man' (who makes an appearance in the film inducing fan-boy erections everywhere.) Norton plays his role with understated finesse, never resorting to overly pained facial expressions, intense eye contact or shouting to display the anguish which is consuming him for the majority of the film. He simply shows that the Hulk sized burden on his back is destroying him, crushing his will to live. He looks haunted and tired, but possesses a steely resolve not to succumb to the beast within, although it would temporarily end his struggle if he did so. He's so good that Christian Bale will have to turn water into wine in The Dark Knight to retain his title as King of the Superheroes (Tobey Maguire? Hahaha, you're kidding...wait, you aren't?) There are many minor elements in 'The Incredible Hulk' that elevates it above most movies in this genre. For example, for nearly half of the film the audience are only provided with fleeting glimpses of the Hulk, much like Batman in 'Begins. His presence is not overused, though it easily could be with the bravura CGI shown at the end. Indeed, the first chase scene does not involve Banner turning into the Hulk at all, it is just an exciting pursuit across rooftops in Rio De Janeiro. Also, the orchestral score lends an air of intelligence to the film and enhances the scenes much more than an overdriven guitar track (hello, Iron Man) would have done.The Incredible Hulk is one of those minority superhero films; it's good. In fact, with regard to any competition it faces, you (if you were looking to conclude a film review with a dialogue related pun) might be inclined to say ""Hulk smash!""","

"DarkVulcan29","15 June 2008","I always have been an Incredible Hulk fan as long as I could remember. I love the T.V. show with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, which ran for 5 and a half years. But I was disappointed with Ang Lee's The Hulk(2003), that failed to do the character any justice, and not mention Eric Bana, don't get me wrong is a good actor, But his performance as Bruce Banner was over the top and unwatchable, and it made me miss Bill Bixby in the role. The Special effects where the only thing good about it. Now it's 5 years later, a new hulk film is here, and Edward Nortan has taken over the role as Bruce Banner. Still on the run from General Ross(William Hurt), Bruce keeps trying to find a cure for his violent transformation , While Ross's military unit is on his trail, He finds refuge with his long lost love Betty Ross(Liv Tyler). And that is all I'm gonna tell you. But this film was Incredible, the action where great, not to mention the effects where awesome. And everybody gave great performances, Including Edward Norton who was more memorable then Eric Bana was, He played it very real, like Bill Bixby did in the T.V. Show. The Incredible Hulk makes up for The Hulk(2003).","

Dr. Bruce Banner(Norton)now a fugitive lives in the shadows trying to find a cure for his condition of gamma poisoning, that when stressed transforms him into a huge muscle bound monster. The military and especially a rouge General Ross(William Hurt)want Banner found in order to exploit his powers. An antidote seems to be a reality; and back in civilization Banner finds himself against a formidable counterpart much like himself, but bigger. It is aggression versus aggression in a battle of powers as the Hulk contends with the Abomination. An enormously high octane duel makes for an exhilarating mind-blowing finale.Special effects are demanding and control your attention. Liv Tyler is terrific as love interest Dr. 'Betty' Ross. Also in the cast: Tim Roth, Tim Blake Nelson, Christina Cabot and a cameo by Lou Ferrigno. And is there a hint of a meeting between the Hulk and the Iron Man?","

"policy134","29 October 2008","Another comic book to live action adaptation and of the same character as a film previously made, in fact.What can you say? Is it entertaining? Sure. Is it funny? Definitely. Is it worth a price of a movie ticket? Not really.The problem is that the movie is all setup. It makes numerous references to upcoming Marvel projects that will entice the moviegoers to go for another round. Not that there is not some things in its favor, particularly Edward Norton as the title character. He is as always a joy to watch.William Hurt scores too with his ""Everything for the cause"" character. Liv Tyler is essentially wasted. The exploration of her connection to Bruce Banner is underdeveloped (something that the 2003 film put more into focus) and some of her lines are downright ridiculous (""It's okay. Bruce, look at me!) Tim Roth does well, although the character is also a bit underdeveloped (maybe as another setup for future installments). For comic relief we have another Tim and you already know what his purpose in the plot is so why spoil it by repeating it.So, worth a rental, skillfully made, but wish it could have been more than a preview of what's to come.","

"schristian-6","10 June 2008","I attended a sneak preview of The Incredible Hulk last night. Incredible? No, but Very Good. And it washes the bad taste left in my mouth from Indiana Jones and the Big Letdown. The story is good, the acting is awesome. Ed Norton is the perfect person to play the tormented Bruce Banner. He is more believable in the roll than Eric Bana. Liv Tyler is very good as Betty Ross (formally played by the tasty Jennifer Connelly) William Hurt as General Ross is impressive and makes for a worthy adversary to Bruce Banner. If I had to come up with a negative, it would be Tim Roth. While I really like him, and he always plays great villains, I feel he's just miss cast here. He seems tiny next to General Ross. Instead of coming off like the English bad ass special op he's supposed to be, he comes off more like a jerk with Napoleon Syndrome. Someone more physically imposing like Vinnie Jones (Bullet tooth from Snatch), or Daniel Craig (the new Bond) would have been more convincing for the part. But I'm just picking here. The movie is a joy. Great action. No long boring, dragging development stuff that the first Hulk had in spades. There are some very nice cameos as well. Some were a surprise, some were not. I didn't see Nick Fury anywhere except in a brief headline in a montage. However I did not remain through the credits, so there might have been a scene at the end like Iron Man that I don't know about. I give it ***1/2 out of ****. I also predict it to make 80+million this weekend when it opens to the public and should ""Hulk Smash"" the competition. The movie received an ovation from the audience at the end which sums it up. A worthy movie made for the fans and everyone else.","

"ferguson-6","23 June 2008","Greetings again from the darkness. Kind of a return to roots for the big green guy. The action scenes are grittier, louder and bigger than in Ang Lee's version ... all with a scaled back, more believable Hulk. This time Edward Norton plays Bruce Banner and Liv Tyler is Betty Ross, his scientific partner and love interest.An unlikely casting decision puts Tim Roth as Hulk's nemesis, Blonsky, and finally as The Abomination. And a very creepy looking Willliam Hurt is the military guy attempting to cover up his mis-deeds. Somehow, Hurt's character has access to every military weapon known to man ... and the authority to use it on a college campus and in the middle of NYC. Hurt looks a bit too much like the new Burt Reynolds. I guess that adds to the list of mutants in the film.Actually, I was impressed with the action scenes ... they were what I had hoped for. Plenty of fighting and chasing and ""smashing"". The dialogue in the non-action scenes was pretty lame, but that's not really what anyone comes to see.A couple other points of interest: creator Stan Lee gets temporarily juiced off the Hulk's blood, Lou Ferrigno shows up twice - once as a pizza chomping security guard and also as the voice of Hulk, Ironman Tony Stark (Robert Downey, jr) shows up for a scene that sets the stage for ""The Avengers"" and the late, great Bill Bixby (TV's Hulk) has a creative cameo via TV and ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"". Speaking of setting the stage ... watch out for Tim Blake Nelson's character in the sequel.","

"departed07","7 December 2008","After a five year absence from the big screen, Hulk is back with more punches and kicks to throw around than a thinking brain which would hurt more movie goers than cramming for a high school exam.I'll admit that I love Ang Lee's version of the ticked off monster in which it took its time getting to know the characters before getting to the action sequences along with seeing how experiments could have consequences. Plus the cut scenes which resembled a comic book had it's high marks though it can only please those who truly love the atmosphere of comic books. This time around French director Louis Leterrier brings more anger while managing to bring depth to the lost soul of Bruce Banner (Edward Norton).""The Incredible Hulk"" is a reboot of the first movie (note: a third Hulk is in the works) in which it pays homage to the classic 1970's series with Edward Norton (taking over Eric Bana) playing the title character after a failed experiment left him to turn into the Hulk while hurting the love of his life Betty Ross (Liv Tyler taking over the Jennifer Connelly role) and becoming a fugitive as he hides in Brazil working in a soda factory. It's not long when Betty's father, the indestructible General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt taking over for Sam Elliot), finds a report that an elderly man has drinking a piece of gamma radiation and immediately finds the location of Bruce where the general gets a British/Russian import soldier by the name of Blonsky (Tim Roth) to help track down Bruce.The action doesn't take much long before Bruce is bullied by a few thugs which leads him to turn into the Hulk smashing and throwing his enemies before going after the secret military. Bruce is now on the run as he wants to head back into the states to find the love of his life along with seeking a cure for his disease while Blonsky convinces his boss to give him the same radiation that made Bruce into the monster he is and having a one on one action.With the film under two hours, The Incredible Hulk is great entertainment and a way of apologizing to those who hated the first Hulk movie in which those who seek mile-a-minute thrill rides will be pleased. The film's got everything from a wild battles, wit humor and while the performances are not Oscar-memorable, I really cared for Norton as the title character where he wanted to rid his curse while remembering from 2003's Hulk that Eric Bana's version actually liked being angry. Liv Tyler, Tim Roth and William Hurt are good as well along with Tim Blake Nelson as Dr. Sterns.A note to all comic book historians or lovers, make sure to check out for Avenger references along with the last scene in the film when a certain character makes a cameo appearance.","

The difference between this movie and better ones is that it does not have a forced joke every minute and a half like later ones. The reason that it has lower average rating is also because back then no Marvel fanboys existed. It is reviewed by pure movie and comic book fans. The other movies I mentioned were people getting on the MARVEL CAN DO NO WRONG bandwagon amd just rilled until today. Marvel is doing good, but this one deserves much more respect and recognition.

"xlars","2 November 2008","Compared to Ang Lee's version of the 'Hulk'  this version is far, far better. The story is superlatively better  and of course, no matter how good Eric Bana is as an actor, Edward Norton  is better to the extreme.The plot is better too, though I will not say much about it.About Tim Roth's unnamed monster  it must be said that it had a certain potential to be improved. Something uncertain was missing  to say the least.One thing that makes everything worth seeing the film  is the interesting philosophical discussion opened when General Thaddeus Ross first  at an early stage of the movie  says: «As far as I'm concerned, that man's whole body is property of the U.S. army» and somewhat later, after Bruce Banner has been treated by Dr. Samuel Sterns: «If you've taken it from me, I'm going to put you in a home for the rest of your life.» The can of worms opened here, is the general understanding that man is not his own master (not delving into any religious conceptions here), but the notion that the ""state"" as such can own a human being.That is of course not in any case true. A man is and remains his own master, with his own free will, and can not be sold  in the same way that a man cannot sell his soul to the devil  because it is not a saleable commodity.This even remains a vital part of the American Declaration of Independence, quoted in the following: «We hold these truths to be self-evident, that ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS, THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.  That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, DERIVING THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED,  That WHENEVER ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT BECOMES DESTRUCTIVE OF THESE ENDS, IT IS THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO ALTER OR TO ABOLISH IT, AND TO INSTITUTE NEW GOVERNMENT, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. BUT WHEN A LONG TRAIN OF ABUSES AND USURPATIONS, PURSUING INVARIABLY THE SAME OBJECT EVINCES A DESIGN TO REDUCE THEM UNDER ABSOLUTE DESPOTISM, IT IS THEIR RIGHT, IT IS THEIR DUTY, TO THROW OFF SUCH GOVERNMENT, and to provide new Guards for their future security».Since the views presented by General Ross absolutely belongs under the characterization of ""despotism"", I'd just as well wish, this would have been stated clearly  in the movie, as an explicit answer to the theories of General Thaddeus Ross","

"dee.reid","1 July 2008","""The Incredible Hulk.""Believe it or not, I'm one of the few who liked (""liked"" is italicized) Ang Lee's 2003 film version ""Hulk,"" which saw the first major screen adaptation of the famed Marvel Comics character co-created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1962. Lee co-created a number of characters for Marvel Comics that defied traditional superheroes before them who were perfect and idealized, and instead were flawed and imperfect, and had much more dramatic potential than any other comic book superheroes at that time.Of course the Incredible Hulk has severe anger-management issues, which has set him apart from his Marvel Comics superhero brethren; Bruce Banner (played here superbly by Edward Norton, although I do miss Eric Bana) is a genius, but sensitive and emotionally withdrawn physicist who is exposed to a lethal dose of gamma radiation and that while showing no outward physical damage to his body, forces him to transform into the monstrous green brute the Hulk when enraged - ""don't make me angry, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry/Hulk Smash!"" - giving rise to a Marvel Comics version of a Jekyll/Hyde relationship.This character first saw light in Ang Lee's film five years ago, but that film was much-maligned by many fans of the comics and critics. I'm proud to say that I wasn't on the ""hate 'Hulk'"" bandwagon in '03. But now, Lee is gone. Replacing him is an entirely new cast and crew that draws much of its inspiration in ""The Incredible Hulk"" directly from the Marvel Comics Stan Lee/Jack Kirby source material. Like ""Iron Man,"" this film marks the second time Marvel is calling all the shots on a movie production.In the director's seat this time, is the French Louis Leterrier, who directed martial arts sensation Jet Li in the utterly spectacular ""Unleashed"" in 2005. To their credit, Norton and Leterrier have sold their film well to this eager movie-going public. While I'll admit that Lee's 2003 film had many faults, it was not entirely unwatchable, and was brilliantly acted and directed and really explored the many troubled layers of its troubled protagonist Bruce Banner.Like many superhero films of late, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a sequel/reboot of Lee's earlier film - replacing the entire cast and crew of the first movie - and takes place five years afterward: Banner is on the run in South America, and is now a day-laborer at a bottling plant in Brazil. On the run from the U.S. military and General Ross (William Hurt) and having to leave behind his beloved Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) - General Ross's daughter - Banner spends his days trying to rid himself of his curse, meditating, and desperately e-mailing an anonymous American scientist back home information about his condition.Meanwhile, General Ross is stepping up his efforts to capture Banner at all costs and use his blood to create an army of super-soldiers. To this end, he's hired a Russian-born mercenary named Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to help him. When a confrontation between Banner and Blonsky's men forces Banner to reveal his Big Green alter-ego, that's when Blonsky takes it upon himself to be ready for round-two. Ross has Blonsky injected with an experimental super-soldier serum to be able to fight the Hulk on his terms next time the two meet face to face. But Blonsky craves more power, and eventually is able to get hold of Banner's gamma radiation-contaminated blood to transform himself into Abomination, and then get ready for a mutant-powered, Japanese monster movie-style CGI showdown in Harlem.""The Incredible Hulk"" does the incredible and is a massively superior second installment to a franchise that up until its release this year seemed to be at a stalemate. Maybe the reason I was not so disappointed with ""Hulk"" in 2003 is because I'm not a reader of The Incredible Hulk comics (those who have read my reviews of superhero movies know that Spider-Man is my all-time favorite superhero). But Leterrier and his crew have sealed the deal here. Leterrier has made ""The Incredible Hulk"" the cinematic equivalent of a well-oiled machine: a masterful, well-paced, and action-packed superhero film that doesn't play dumb to its characters or audience. This is not your typical comic book superhero film: it's dark, it's thematic, and it's much more intense in its action and special effects. Speaking of special effects, this CGI Hulk (voiced by '70s television Hulk Lou Ferrigno, who also shares a cameo credit as a security guard), is much more streamlined and fluid and three-dimensional, a true force to be reckoned with this time out. Norton is the film's emotional centerpiece. He proves to be an unlikely but certainly trustworthy Bruce Banner.What I liked especially about this film was its emotional content. It's clear that Bruce Banner and his CGI alter-ego Hulk have anger management issues. He's cursed. He has some of the worst luck of any superhero in the entire Marvel Comics Universe. Don't make him angry, because, you wouldn't like him when he's angry. Because of that, he's his own worst enemy. Of all superheroes out there saving the world, he's always trying to get rid of his ""gift"" (or curse), and failing miserably every time. (Who said that superheroes had to be perfect, all the time?) There are a number of well-acted moments between Norton and Tyler, as they both try to rekindle a doomed love affair that makes up the film's emotional core. I haven't been drawn into one such love affair since ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004), my favorite superhero film of all time and my #2 favorite movie of all time.This movie isn't perfect, of course. It has many attributes that make it much stronger than ""Hulk."" The cast could from that film could have been reused here, but it's Hollywood; they always win. Still, ""The Incredible Hulk"" does the ""incredible"" and then some.9/10","

"kirk-246","26 June 2009","I thought that the first movie definitely could've been as good as 'The Incredible Hulk'.But it wasn't.Although it was entertaining,there should've been a more interesting plot along with a better cast.The sequel actually got it right.Edward Norton did a better job as the Hulk,and Liv Tyler did a better job as Betty Ross.There is also more action.And no action movie would be perfect without special effects,which in this movie are incredible.So if you enjoyed the first movie,then I definitely recommend this highly superior sequel.If you hated the first movie,then I still recommend this movie.If there is any word that sums up this movie,here it is: INCREDIBLE","

"ed_two_o_nine","1 July 2008","OK fight fans here we go. First let me get started by declaring I am the only person I know who actually liked the Ang Lee Hulk movie. So for me this is not an essential remake. I thought that movie had a magnificent sense of pathos. But here we go the great things with modern super hero movies is just like the comics we can re-imagine them as and when the film makers see fit, and in this case it has been done well. Marvel is on a bit or a role here as they have now surpassed my expectation with both this movie and 'Iron Man' This movie seems to cleverly run on from Lee's version whilst giving you an altered history in the opening credits. We have Bruce Banner now holed up in Brazil a fugitive trying to understand his so called disease. Whilst General Ross is desperately searching for him to cultivate his research into a weapon. Where this film differs from the first is that it is action pretty much all the way and very well done it is too. Hulk seems a little smaller and therefore more accessible but the CG is good and the rainy sequence trick is used once again to help the blending in of scenes. Also where this film will work for the fan boys is in the appearance of a proper comic book villain in Abomination. Abomination's back story is handled well and Tim Roth gives a good hammy performance to match the stellar efforts from the rest of the cast. (I have heard Edward Norton is unhappy with the cinema cut and would like to see the cut he preferred, and would really hope he makes himself available for any potential sequels). There was some good homage's to the past with a TC clip of Bill Bixby, a cameo by Ferringo and the inevitable Stan Lee cameo and a real plus for me they even worked in a little bit of the old TV theme tune. A real unexpected treat.","

"freakfire-1","25 June 2008","Before watching this Hulk movie, I should have taken the time to watch the one released a few years back that was directed by Ang Lee. Instead, I was given the chance to watch this and I had to take it. Seeming that this was going to be one of the year's better films, I thought why not. And it lived up to a lot of its billing.The origins of the Hulk are given, although not as explained as I would have liked. His fleeing to Brazil in the beginnings of the film do make for some good scenery, including the introduction of Débora Nascimento to the film stage. Though I doubt she will be given a lot of time on the screen for now, she certainly is a beautiful woman and made Liv Tyler pale in comparison.The action was good, but I thought it was flawed. The military operations against the Hulk just seemed to come out of the blue at times and did not explain it as much as one would hope. Even the final fight seemed a little bit of a mess. Still it was enjoyable.Overall, it was a good film. I am hoping I see more of Débora Nascimento in the future. ""B+""","

"voicemaster71","17 June 2008","When it comes to the Incredible Hulk, I am and will always love the classic TV series the best. But now, I've seen the second best Hulk interpretation ever made!! Oddly enough, I wound up seeing it three times this weekend. I just couldn't get enough of it.The 2003 Ang Lee film was a total abomination (pardon the pun)and it would be similar to, ""What if somebody attempted to do a lower budget Superman movie a few years before Christopher Reeve, Richard Donner, and the Salkinds got involved?"" That movie was a joke that was not funny at all. The Incredible Hulk was a brilliant collaboration and this time, both the director and the star are both Hulk fans of both the comics and the TV series. Louis Leterrier was an ideal choice for a director. Edward Norton made an excellent Bruce Banner. He looked a little like Bill Bixby, but only a little bit whereas he mostly represents the comic book Banner far better than the poorly miscast Eric Bana of the 2003 film. The retold origin was far better than the plot of the previous film and was only restricted to one part early on in the film so that it's not rehashed. Liv Tyler made a decent Betty Ross and she was much more loving and understanding than Jennifer Connelly was, but in terms of beauty, I am more partial to Connelly myself. Add the grey hair and the mustache, and William Hurt executed his performance as General Thunderbolt Ross. The only thing I liked in the 2003 film was the casting of Jennifer Connelly and Sam Elliot as Betty and her father, the General, so I could go either way with the Ross's.This Hulk movie has many things the previous attempt did not. For one thing, it has some humor in it while the other film was too dark, brooding, and serious. And this film had good length while the other one was too long. That is one agreement that I'm glad Marvel won. Sorry Ed. And most of all, we had a real villain along with a colossal fight for the Hulk. Tim Roth was great as Emil Blonsky and his Abomination was a true menace and a frightening one as well. Best of all, this Incredible Hulk movie has many nods to the classic TV series. Lou Ferrigno has a better cameo role and he was the voice of the Hulk. There is a brief cameo of the late Bill Bixby seen on a TV set while Bruce Banner is channel surfing. And what I'm surprised no one has mentioned yet, there is also a nod to the late Jack Colvin's character in that there is a character named Jack McGee found somewhere in this movie. You need to see the movie for yourself to see these nods. The Hulk himself is CGI of course, and to some, that is probably a big letdown, but this time, the Hulk looks far better and he doesn't grow when he gets angrier, plus he looks more like his comic book counterpart. One more thing, the musical score was outstanding!! Craig Armstrong's score sounded like real Hulk music as opposed to Danny Elfman's 2003 score, which sounded a little too Asian and martial arts type of music. But the intro theme of this new movie is really captivating. For my final evaluation. If you want to see a Hulk movie that is truly good in every way and will capture the interest of both TV series and comics fans, the Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton is THE movie to see and completely discard the Ang Lee film of 2003. I give this movie 2 thumbs up!!","

"MaxBorg89","24 June 2008","X-Men: big franchise. Spider-Man: ditto. In fact, even Fantastic Four was granted a sequel. But not good old Hulk: despite the best efforts on behalf of director Ang Lee and a cast that included Eric Bana and Nick Nolte, the green giant's big screen outing, though lauded by most critics and, to lesser extent, fans, wasn't big enough at the box office to convince Universal another installment was a good idea. Now, with the studio merely distributing (Marvel itself threw in the cash, which is also why there are no legal obstacles to having other characters from different comics in the film - more on that later) and a completely renewed cast and crew, The Incredible Hulk is a noble and for the most part successful attempt to reboot the series, a bit like Batman Begins.Technically, this is not a sequel to Lee's film (the opening montage depicts a completely different explanation for the Hulk's origin), but it is indicated that five years have passed since Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) disappeared from the United States (and there is a five-year gap between the release of the two movies), and the story begins in South America, where the previous version ended. To be more specific, Banner is hiding in Brazil, trying to control his rage and having no contact with the outside world, except for occasional e-mails with a certain Mr. Blue (Banner calls himself Mr. Green, obviously), who might succeed in finding a cure for the protagonist's condition. But while he may avoid others, others are looking for him, and a radiation-related accident (which has to do with Stan Lee's mandatory appearance) enables General Ross (William Hurt) to locate him and send a team, led by the slightly insane Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), to get him. The rest of the plot is rather basic: Banner is on the run, he becomes the Hulk on a few occasions, returns to the US and has no ally besides Mr. Blue and old flame Betty Ross (Liv Tyler). Oh, and did I mention Blonsky decides to become a monster himself in order to bring a little fairness to the game?The script, which is largely influenced by the '70s TV show, with the addition of Bruce Jones' comic-book cycle (the Mr. Blue subplot is lifted from his arc), aims to solve the one problem many think caused Lee's take on the subject to alienate fans: there was too much psychology/emotion, not enough action (some people made the same remark about Superman Returns). For that reason, hiring The Transporter director Louis Leterrier seemed like a logical choice, although there was doubt regarding his ability to handle what little ""deeper material"" there has to be in a picture like this. That he succeeds is nearly all thanks to Norton: not only does he play Banner with a conviction few would have in a role like this (then again, he's already dealt with multiple personalities in Primal Fear and Fight Club), but he also co-wrote the screenplay with Zak Penn (the sole credited writer), his deep knowledge of the comic proving a great asset when it comes to finding the right mixture of action, drama and humor (the ""hungry/angry"" joke is one of the best). But this isn't just Norton's movie: Roth, the actor formerly known as Mr. Orange, is joyously manic, and Tim Blake Nelson's sequel-suggesting presence comes close to marvelous.Any complaints? Actually, yes: Tyler, despite her fair share of blockbuster experience, brings very little of significance to her character, not counting a couple of scenes, and the inevitable climactic showdown between ""hero"" and villain could have been reduced by at least five minutes. But hey, at least we get a Hulk that looks a lot better than the ""poor man's Shrek"" seen in the 2003 version. Plus, he finally utters the famous line ""Hulk smash!"" (with Lou Ferrigno's voice, no less). That, in addition to a really great cameo by Robert Downey Jr. (which, unlike Sam Jackson's role in Iron Man, has not become a post-credits ""surprise""), indicates that if a second (or third, depending on how you interpret the connection between the films) movie gets made, it's gonna be pretty, well, incredible.","

"tavm","16 June 2008","Having managed to miss Ang Lee's Hulk from 5 years ago, I watched this version of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's green-skinned, gamma-radiated monster with an open mind. In a word: AWESOME! Nice recap of the origin during the opening credits before we find Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) in Brazil having basically stayed calm for at least a year. That won't last long. There's also General Ross (William Hurt), Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) who later becomes The Abomination, Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) who tries to cure Banner, and Betty Ross (Liv Tyler)-the general's daughter who stands by Bruce through all his trials and tribulations. Great mixture of drama, suspense, and action as provided by director Louis Leterrier. Eagle-eyed viewers who've lived for the last 40 years should have no trouble spotting previous portrayers of Banner/Hulk: Bill Bixby in a television scene from his earlier series ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"", and Lou Ferrigno as a security guard who lets Norton in (He also says something as the Hulk in a later scene). And of course, Stan Lee puts in his Hitchcockian cameo! One more person I'd like to mention is Ty Burrell-late of the cancelled show ""Back to You""-playing a shrink who also gets involved with Betty. In short, The Incredible Hulk is another very worthy movie made from a Marvel Comics character. P.S. My first real encounter with the Hulk was from a comic book I got for my 9th birthday that had a 45 r.p.m. record attached from Power Records that provided the voices of the characters and narration in that book. The Abomination was the villain in that one.","

"dbborroughs","15 June 2008","Essentially a sequel to both the last film (Banner was in the jungle at the end of Ang Lee's film) and the TV series (Lou Ferigno and Bill Bixby have cameos and we hear the theme music) the film is also a restart of it all.As the film opens Banner is is Brazil working to try and find a cure for his problem. When the military shows up to capture him he flees and eventually heads home so that he can make contact with a scientist who is helping him via the internet. Much damage ensues.The action scenes are spectacular and much better than I thought they would be. Its great that even though we are watching what are often CGI characters running around we still have a sense of danger. Betty or any other puny human could very easily get hurt. The battles are not neat affairs and there is considerable collateral damage which plays out in little pieces on TV screens and else where once the battles are over. The battles are also epic in ways that only movies and comic books can be. Hulk is larger than life and what happens when he is engaged in battle is too.The real joy here are the characters which are invest with real weight. I've been reading the comic for decades and this is the first time that General Ross wasn't one dimensional.Kudos to William Hurt for giving us a real character. Tim Roth is a blast as Blonsky/The abomination. The real story here is Liv Tyler as Betty Ross and Edward Norton as Banner/The Hulk. We feel the weight of their relationship. We feel the love they have and that they are joined forever together. Its amazing. The feelings they have is the reason that much of the film has a real emotional weight. Its nice to have the Hulk smash things but at the same time we care about the characters. We feel the pain in the Hulks eyes when he realizes Betty is in danger. we feel the anger when someone hurts her. Its adds greatly to the film.When the film is ""on"", which is most of the time, its one of the best comic films ever made.Its not just action and heroes its people and characters with real emotion. Much of the film is right on target.The problem with the film is that at times action sacrifices character and a clear plot. We're dropped into the action in such away as to make us feel that we're missing something. Yes 45 years of the comic, the TV incarnations and the Ang Lee film sort of fill things in, but at the same time its coming in on chapter two of a serial. There is also the publicized battle between Marvel and Edward Norton.Norton wanted a longer more thoughtful film and Marvel wanted this action packed cut. Give me Norton's cut. I could be wrong but there are several times as we jumped through time and space or from action scene to action scene, I got the sense that something was missing. More than once I thought a little something was lost- details mostly- that could have strengthened or deepened what we saw. For all I know this maybe the best cut of the film, but at the same time since the action works because of the characters and plot I think that the 15 or 20 minutes that Marvel chopped out could only make things better.Yes I liked it. Yes I frequently said-out loud- ""thats it thats it they got it right"". Yes it moved me.Go see it.8 out of 10 (maybe a little less but not enough so you'd notice)","

"Leofwine_draca","5 August 2016","This sequel to Ang Lee's 2003 HULK revamp is brought to us by Louis Leterrier, the man responsible for the highly ludicrous (but entertaining) TRANSPORTER 2. THE INCREDIBLE HULK is equally ludicrous but not quite as entertaining, although it does all right for what it is: a simple, shallow, effects-driven adventure aimed at bringing the comic-book storyline into the 21st century. It's certainly a lot more fun than the deadly dull Ang Lee attempt, a hodge podge of plot lines and events seemingly cobbled together from various different movies.The first third involves Edward Norton (replacing Eric Bana as Bruce Banner) hiding out in South America, pursued by government agents in various foot chase scenes reminiscent of THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM (although nowhere near as good). The second third moves back to the USA for some schmaltzy love stuff involving the terribly insipid Liv Tyler, whose presence screams of miscasting. The final third goes for all-out action as two super-beasts pummel each other into submission in the streets of a bustling city.I'm not a great fan of superhero movies but THE INCREDIBLE HULK passes the time readily enough. Edward Norton is a better actor than the film warrants, and he kept me watching despite my reservations. I thought there were too many scenes involving his green alter ego, and the CGI varies between impressive and quite crude. A lengthy bit with the creature and Tyler in a rain-bound cave smacks of KING KONG without any of the pathos.Tim Roth is on hand playing the movie's villain, and he's pretty good, filling his character with unmentioned depravity despite the sometimes lacklustre script. William Hurt is Liv Tyler's dad, and doesn't have much to go with. There are various scenery-smashing interludes involving the big green guy, but they go over the top with the CGI and are quite boring compared to the moments with the human actors. The ending is similar to IRON MAN in that it involves two CGI creations beating each other up, but manages to be a little bit more involved than that catastrophe.","

"Rex_Stephens","16 June 2008","Fans of The Incredible Hulk rejoice! This is exactly how the Hulk should have been portrayed five years ago. I still have nightmare visions of Nick Nolte flailing his arms about as Bruce's father, followed by his ever-famous prison photo. And no one can blame Ang Lee for wanting to quit movies entirely after that film. He ended up getting revenge on all of us for Brokeback Mountain but I'm straying from the real topic here...Fans of movie-making and films rejoice? Well ... this 'reboot' is a better version than the original but not by much. There are elements of conflict, terror, action, and tension, all crammed into a melodramatic musical score with somewhat way too obvious (hence, boring) direction and screenplay. What keeps The Incredible Hulk from a total belly-up is Edward Norton, William Hurt and Tim Roth can still pull a heck of a performance in spite of everything. The Incredible Hulk's updated look deserves a note too, but five years later, it is to be expected. I'm just happy the Hulk's back I guess. The climactic bout between the Abomination and Hulk failed to deliver. Like the movie itself, the fight was a laughable mess at most, ending in the silliest of fashion. Unless you're a fan of the series, I would not care to recommend it.","

"g-bodyl","15 November 2008","The Incredible Hulk is a great movie, another success to the Marvel company and superhero films even though Hulk is not really a superhero. This movie is much better than Ang Lee's 2003 version. I did not not see that version, but the trailers for that Hulk are dumb and the reviews were not too good. Anyway, Bruce Banner turns into the Hulk because his experiment went wrong. Now, Banner is being pursued by the relentless general and his sidekick, Blonsky. While being pursued, Banner/Hulk is helped by the general's daughter, Elizabeth Ross and doctors like Dr. Sterns. The visual effects are very good. They are not cheap effects as there is supposedly in Lee's version. The acting is decent especially Edward Norton and William Hurt. Tim Roth and his character is a bit annoying and it's hard to understand his accent. I liked Blonsky's transformation. He is bigger and stronger than the Hulk himself. This is another success for Marvel. I rate this movie 9/10.","

"Norway1","16 June 2008","After watching the first couple of trailers for this I was very unimpressed and even began to doubt (big time) that this would be any good. Thank goodness I was SO wrong!Let me start by admitting I actually liked HULK (2003) aside from Nick Nolte and the last 10 minutes or so. Sure, it was a little short on action and heavy on drama, but I thought the effects were awesome and the acting very good.This Hulk blows that one completely away! It is so much better I couldn't even believe it! Maybe the reason I liked it so much was because of my very low expectations but this movie delivered in every way a comic-book movie should!Before watching I read the first 15 or so comments here on IMDb to see how people were reacting. Most of them positive, there were still a handful of negative reviews that had me questioning. However after seeing the film I must wonder what those people expected. I just can't imagine it being any better! Seriously. It freaking rocked!Marvel, I can't wait for more!If you want to compare your tastes with mine, here's my opinion of some other comic book films (rating out of 10)...

"zardoz-13","11 May 2015","""Transporter"" director Louis Leterrier's ""The Incredible Hulk"" delivers the melodramatic thrills and chills conspicuously lacking in Ang Lee's self-conscious, brooding, tragic predecessor. Edward Norton takes over the role of Bruce Banner from Eric Bana. Ironically, Norton turned the role before Bana took it. Mind you, Norton is an exceptional actor, but he is basically miscast. Simply said, he doesn't look appropriate for the role of an action hero. Meantime, Mark Ruffalo qualifies as the cinema's best Hulk. Meantime, Bana was a better fit, but Norton is not without sympathy. Norton's Banner is a fugitive on the lam. If you have forgotten Ang Lee's ""Hulk,"" Leterrier and Pen use the opening titles to retell the origins of the Hulk in the laboratory. Hardcore Hulk fans may not like this departure from the Marvel canon. The original ""Hulk"" movie followed the same strategy of orchestrating the transformation in a lab.As the action unfolds, Leterrier and ""Elektra"" scenarist Zac Penn have our intelligent hero hiding out in Brazil and slumming as an employee at a dilapidated soda bottle plant. Bruce is their jack-of-all-trades handy man, and his ability to fix things is what gets him into trouble. After repairing a mechanism, he nicks a finger, and droplets of his blood stain the conveyor belt and contaminate one bottle. Clearly, quality control is not a strong point at this factory. When our hero isn't working in the factory, he communicates via the Internet with Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson of ""The Astronaut Farmer""), and they struggle to discover a cure. Of course, nothing works for Bruce. At the same time, Bruce is taking lessons from a martial arts mentor about how to control his rage. He wears a watch that monitors his pulse and develops deep-breathing from the diaphragm to curb his rage. Eventually, after that tainted bottle of Pingo Doce reaches America, an ordinary guy (""Hulk"" co-creator Stan Lee) in Milwaukee experiences a reaction to it, and General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt of ""Altered States"") assembles a team led by an elite commando, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth of ""Reservoir Dogs""), who is locked and loaded for combat. Blonsky and his team fly into Brazil and narrowly miss capturing Banner. Banner's mongrel dog awakens him in time for him to make his escape. Ross congratulates Blonsky for a good job, but Blonsky wants to take another crack at the monstrous green thing he encountered in the factory. ""It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball,"" he tells Ross. Banner makes his way up through Central America and reunites with Ross' daughter, Betty (Liv Tyler of ""Armageddon""), and Ross is on his trail again. This time Blonsky and his team are prepared better when they tangle with the Hulk on the Culver University campus. Betty tries to convince Bruce to turn himself over to her father. Bruce points out that Ross wants what is in him and will sacrifice him to extract his DNA to forge an army of super soldiers. Bruce reminds Betty that he wants to find a cure. Again, Ross wants to create super soldiers with Bruce's super strength and agility.For the record, Banner transforms into the Hulk at about 23 minutes into ""The Incredible Hulk."" Leterrier stages some reasonably good action scenes. Ultimately, the Penn screenplay boils down to a chase thriller that concludes face to face showdown like an old fashioned western between Banner and Blonsky. Tim Roth makes a terrific adversary, but the final confrontation suffers because you know it is just a clash of CGI titans. Liv Tyler and William Hurt are serviceable as Banner's girlfriend and another of his adversaries. You can get your quotient of blood, gore, and violence out of this PG-13 epic.","

"lastliberal","10 May 2009","I'm not a comic book fan, but everyone knows The Hulk. You don't need to love comics to appreciate this movie.Now, it was an uncredited Robert Downey Jr. that drew me to the flick, but I was not disappointed in what I saw from Edward Norton (American History X, Primal Fear).Liv Tyler, who doesn't get the credit she deserves, was great as the former girlfriend. When they met after a long absence, it was like Garance and Baptiste all over again.William Hurt was you typical military officer - all mission and no feelings. Even his own daughter (Tyler) wouldn't talk about him. He was excellent in the role.Man, Tim Roth was perfect! Tim Blake Nelson was an über Geek, and a real delight.The special effects were tremendous. bring on Hulk II.","

"evanston_dad","1 July 2008","If you were hoping for a big-screen version of the Hulk that would clear the vomit taste from your mouth left by Ang Lee's debacle a few years ago, you're in luck. This new film that starts over with the Hulk's story is lean, mean and green, much like its titular troubled soul. That troubled soul, who exists under the geeky guise of Bruce Banner during his more laid back moments, is played by Edward Norton, and that's largely why this film is better. Superhero movies are a dime a dozen anymore, and they all, to a lesser or greater extent, look and sound the same. One of the only things that distinguishes one from the other is the quality of the acting, which is why this film can hold its head up with that other surprisingly good superhero film from earlier this summer, ""Iron Man"".Along with Norton, ""The Incredible Hulk"" features William Hurt, as the standard slightly crazy Army general that we all love to hate, Tim Roth, as the Hulk's nemesis, The Abomination, and Liv Tyler as Betty, the love interest. Tyler and Hurt get put through the usual acting paces their roles would suggest, which means Tyler must look worried and Hurt must glower, but they look worried and glower well, respectively. And the idiosyncratic casting of Roth as the film's villain actually lends the film a bit of novelty.By the end, the movie devolves into an action film indistinguishable from any other, all deafening sound effects and been-there-done-that CGI. But everything leading up to that is slightly better than average for the genre.Grade: B+","

"kyle-cruse","22 August 2008","As opposed to ""Hulk,"" the adaptation made in 2003, ""The Incredible Hulk"" actually looks like some work was put into it. The first film had no emotion and was mostly filled with long scenes of dialogue or useless scenes with the Hulk fighting other creatures. That film also made up stuff about Bruce Banner's dad being involved in turning Bruce into the Hulk, which was never a part of the old TV shows. This film is very emotional and puts a greater focus on Bruce, not what he turns into. Unlike the first film, the cast is actually made up of known people, including Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, and William Hurt. There are also little bits of humor that make this a more fun film to watch, such as Bruce's girlfriend giving him a pair of purple shorts to wear. The action scenes are good, but not great. This is a pretty gruesome film that can be a bit disturbing to some audiences like myself, though it is still far less than ""The Dark Knight."" It can be painful to watch when the two Hulks are fighting and when Bruce is injected with the chemicals. This is not an unwatchable film, but be aware that it can be tough to watch at times. Parents take caution; it is fairly violent (not bloody) and somewhat gruesome for young audiences. Know your kids and whether or not they should see this.*** out of ****","

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","19 January 2010","This takes a considerably different approach than Lee's poetic, cerebral attempt. It is grittier, dirtier and considerably more intense. Props to Marvel for getting the rights back, and now doing these movies themselves. And on that note, I commend the people involved in making this for clearly not only knowing, but of infinitely greater importance, *understanding*, the material. From what I've read, which is admittedly not the most remarkable amount to boast with, they hit the mark to a large extent with this. The plot is engaging, develops nicely throughout, and remains interesting. Every bit of the plentiful action is awesome, epic, exciting and entertaining. That final fight... wow, that is the best of its kind that I've seen in recent memory. The writing is well-done all the way. Dialog, save for a few lines here and there, is magnificent. The characters are well-written, with some quirkiness here and there, fortunately seldom taking over. The humor in general is rather balanced, and the several solid laughs that are to be had do not detract from the rest. This holds talented actors, and it shows. I have to say, when I heard about Tyler, I couldn't see her in the part, though after I heard Leterrier's thoughts on it in an interview I was hopeful, and now I do get how she works as Betty. Norton beautifully internalizes, and he's not off in his performance for a second. Hurt *becomes* Thunderbolt Ross(if, arguably, the role isn't all that fleshed out in this). There is genuine emotion in this. Notable range is even found in the CGI(which gets a serious upgrade), with facial expressions and real weight to the beings. The FX in general are excellent. This gives fans numerous things that they would want in it. The pacing is fast, at times, perhaps too much so(then again, it's not overwhelming, and the audience always gets to catch their breath when needed). I've heard(well, read) that 70 minutes was cut out... obviously, that shows, at least a little. For my money, this is, nonetheless, amazing. The tone is well-achieved, and this can be dark, without reaching a point where only grown-ups can watch... and it never seems tame, either. Nods to the original medium are found in this, and they're well-integrated. There is a brief suggestive bit, a little moderate language, mild violence and/or disturbing images in this. The trailers give a lot away; however, it's still an awful lot of fun, and it is not terribly predictable. The 2-Disc Special Edition DVD holds well-done featurettes(three of which I will review on their individual pages here on the site), with explaining of the effects and stunts, an alternate ending, 43 minutes of deleted scenes, a 6 minute animated comic, and an amusing and informative commentary track by the director and Tim Roth. All of the aforementioned is well worth watching. I recommend this to fans of those who put the film together and/or the comics. 8/10","

"mm-39","29 June 2008","The Hulk is a well directed, and crafted movie. The back in time, and present time filming creates a great mise en scene! The continuity of the directing creates a great pace where the viewer is enthralled with the story. Eric Bana did the last film and Norton had big shoes to fill. Norton especially with the beginning scene of hiding in Brazil, plays the on the run Bruce Banner character excellently. The ending is great, I was shocked. William Hurt plays a good bad guy again. I will not ruin the ending, but will give a hint. There is a clue to the ending at the beginning of the movie. Two merged into one is all is my hint. 8/10 green monsters","

"Special-K88","14 June 2008","Research scientist Dr. Bruce Banner has the weight of the world on his shoulders; a genetics experiment gone haywire could potentially turn him into a monster if he loses his temper, thus making him the target of a relentless U.S. government. Living in isolation in South America, Banner seeks out a cure for his unstable condition, but in order to complete his research he must return to the States and seek out his long lost love (Tyler) with her bloodhound Army general of a father (Hurt) in tow. Reimagining of Ang Lee's 2003 Marvel Comics adaptation succeeds by avoiding needlessly convoluted story tangents, instead relying on a more straightforward approach with plenty of destructive action scenes, superior special effects, and characters who make sense. It wouldn't be as effective without the work of an excellent cast, with Norton perfectly vulnerable as Banner, Tyler warm and empathetic as Betty, Roth chilling and tenacious as Bronsky, Hurt callous and cold-blooded as General Ross. Climax is a bit noisy, but it's still solid entertainment. ***","

"gritfrombray-1","6 December 2008","At last, Marvel have stepped in and taken the reins of the production of their films. With Spider-Man 3 lacking the class of the previous film and X-Men 3 the same we are treated to the same roller-coaster ride we seen in Iron Man. Ed Norton is fantastic as the beleaguered Bruce Banner and in my opinion resembles the troubled David Banner from the TV series, superbly played by the late Bill Bixby. Liv Tyler is class as Betty Ross and is always capable of delivering some emotion and feeling into her parts. Bruce's experiments toward a cure and the military's involvement because of the planned super soldier programme is all in line with the upcoming Captain America story. Abomination was in the movie long enough so not to take from Bruce's plight. A clue of what's to come is hinted at when Bruce smiles at the end and his eyes light up green! The Tony Stark cameo at the end capped it all and gave us a clue of what's coming, and a brief reminder that there's some tie ins on the way!! In all, well done Marvel and keep them coming!","

"anaconda-40658","24 June 2015","The Incredible Hulk (2008): Dir: Louis Leterrier / Cast: Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, William Hurt, Ty Burrell: Not a sequel to the 2003 film but a different take on the huge green monster scientist Bruce Banner transforms into once anger sets in. He is tracked down by military who wishes to subdue his power. Director Louis Leterrier does well with a decent screenplay that bares similarities to the Ang Lee version yet details additionally elements that work every bit as well. Edward Norton plays Banner who struggles to control his rage. He is sought after by the Army until a freak accident has him on the run. Years later he is discovered at a bottling plant after his blood accidentally enters a bottle. He must learn to control his rage and master this condition. Liv Tyler is no Jennifer Connelly and her demeanor throughout becomes increasingly annoying especially in her constant crying out of his name. Ty Burrell as her boyfriend is a pointless addition to the cast as well. Tim Roth plays a soldier who injects himself with the same substance used on Banner. He will mutate and engage in a thunderous battle against the Hulk. William Hurt as Ross's military father jeopardizes his relationship with his daughter while on pursuit of what he perceives as the villain. His drinking scene in the conclusion gives way to a great cameo. As good as the 2003 version sustaining its hulking effects. Score: 9 ½ / 10","

"headfulofghosts126","15 June 2008","Here's the thing about comic book heroes. Most of them have silly names and often sillier costumes. But there's something so fundamental and human about the ones that have survived half a century. Spider-Man isn't just some dude swinging around New York. He's a young kid trying to balance so many competing parts of his life and spreading himself too thin. We all know what that's like. With the X-Men it's not just people with cool powers kicking the crap out of each other. It's about being part of a minority and others discriminating against you. Who hasn't had a taste of that? And with the Hulk, it's ultimately anger management. Literally having a monster inside of you and how difficult it is to control it. It's about being at war with yourself. So yes... his name is ridiculous. The idea of a giant green monster is a little out there. But when these movies have enough small character moments peppered in with the action there's a chance to really connect with them and allow yourself to forgive how unrealistic they dare to be because you're so immersed in their universe. The Incredible Hulk is not the best comic book movie ever made. It's not even in the top three. But it's a solid film and it could have been so much worse.I have fond memories of the old TV show. Back then it was a waiting game until the Hulk showed up. Now it's the hardest part of the show to swallow and I find myself really intrigued by David Banner's plight. I didn't hate the Ang Lee movie but I have no desire to ever revisit it. This new incarnation has elements of both but for the most part does a satisfactory job of establishing itself as something new. The first act was the best part of the film for me. Everything until the battle on the college campus. The introductory scenes of Bruce were really effective and the first Hulk-out was almost legitimately frightening. The later action scenes are bigger in scope but they're never as creative.Norton's been making headlines for all the wrong reasons lately but there's no denying he's got the goods. I have a feeling there were a lot of character moments left on the cutting room floor but what's left is still an admirable performance. And even though it's an underwritten role, Liv Tyler is a complete sweetheart as Betty. There's such a charming girl-next-door quality to her and even though I don't completely buy her as a scientist I totally believed in the connection she and Bruce shared. I felt like William Hurt and Tim Roth both received pretty thankless roles. They weren't bad by and means but the script (or this cut anyways) never allows them the chance to do much other than beg to fight the Hulk again or scream for more firepower.The CGI isn't fantastic. That's just a fact. But it only pulled me out of the film a couple of times. And the Hulk looks about a million times better than he did in the last movie. As expected it does take over once the third act hits and for me that stuff just isn't as enthralling. The film never lost me, it just never reached the heights of the opening thirty minutes. Not for me at least. If I were thirteen I probably would have drooled over the last fight scene.In the pantheon of comic book movies Hulk stands above Fantastic Four and Daredevil but never quite makes it to the top tier of films like Spider-Man 2, X2, Batman Begins, or even Iron Man. It's comfortably in the middle. I don't feel like I wasted my time or money. But I'm not anxiously awaiting a sequel either.You really could do worse.","

"gigan-92","11 May 2009","Well, after nearly five years, most thought there was to be no sequel to the 2003 ""Hulk"". But, shortly after the spectacular ""Iron Man"", ""The Incredible Hulk"" arrived. I was surprised to find out Louis Leterrier was behind this thrilling film, but I guess he was truly the right man for the job. Where do I begin? Well, to start I'll say the story by Zak Penn was dope. The pacing is better I must admit and most viewers will find it much easier to embrace and connect with the characters. Edward Norton is perfect as the ""mild-mannered"" Bruce Banner. Although some say he didn't portray the conflicted-side of Bruce enough, I think so. Liv Tyler and William Hurt also star, making this cast spectacular to say the least. The Hulk himself looks much more fearsome and the muscles are much more defined. In short he looks much more ""beasty"". But it comes at a cost of diminished realism really. The first Hulk actually looked like a human stillquite a bit, so maybe in the end he was a litte overdone.Speaking of beasty, Tim Roth is excellent as Emil Blonsky/Abomination. One major problem with the first film was its villain, and this film definitely doesn't disappoint there. Abomination's rampage scene alone is exhilarating, and the end fight delivers. It's brutal, bloody and last forever, YES!!! The score by Craig Armstrong is magnificent, letting the film play as a scary monster movie of sorts and I utterly love it!! Only one word can describe this film....Incredible!","

The story is completely made up for the sake of the movie and hasn't got much to do with the comics.It is filled to the brim with archetype characters and people acting stupid (why oh why do they keep shooting the hulk with regular ammo??) In general your classic brainless hollywood action movie. You know it is pretty average when the highlight is a crazy cab ride.I liked the cameos and the few nodges towards the comics that were actually there.I honestly think it is a travesty that Ang Lees Hulk has an 5,6 average and this has a 6,7. Ang Lees was way better. It isn't even close. Then again i never understood the hate for that movie.","

"cshep","17 June 2008","When you think of Invincible, you think of Iron Man, when you say Incredible, it has to be the ""HULK!"" And this film, pretty much achieves that goal, with a few less than credible moments .Bruce Banner(Edward Norton) is now in Brazil, trying to reverse the effects of the original experiment that left him filled with Gamma rich blood. Gen. Thunderbolt Ross(William Hurt) is on the prowl to find him, and eventually locates him. and sends a small detachment, including Emil Blonsky(Tim Roth), a veteran British soldier who loves the excitement of Battle ! Banner escapes and returns to Virginia, to enlist the aid of Mr. Blue, an unknown internet connection whom is trying to help find the ""Cure.""As fate would have it, he runs into his old flame Elizabeth (Betty) Ross, (Liv Tyler), scientist, and daughter of the General.Now injected with an experimental drug,Blonsky aims to become a Super Soldier, and the pursuit of the Hulk begins again.Needless to say, the transformation doesn't become complete until Blonsky meets up with Mr. Blue, and this is when the Abomination becomes incarnate. The battle scenes are Terrific, with breathtaking action almost non stop for about the last 20 minutes of the film. While CGI still isn't where it will be, these creatures are Real enough to provide the punch necessary to deliver a Big Emotional Wallop.So, while this incarnation of this composite Hulk film, pays tribute to past Banners(Bill Bixby) and Hulks( Lou Ferrigno), it can stand on its own as a testimony to the power of the emergence, of man,Director Louis Leterier and computer , to produce an entertaining comic book on film. 8 out of 10. Runtime 114 minutes.","

"paulclaassen","3 July 2021","Wow, this was so much better than Ang Lee's 'Hulk' from 2003! 'The Incredible Hulk' is among my favorite superhero/comic book movies.I enjoy this movie for so many reasons. Firstly, the casting. Edward Norton is excellent as Hulk. He brings a sense of realism to the fantasy character, that was absent from 2003's 'Hulk'. The script is also really good, with well set-up characters I cared about. The visual effects are also incredible. I mean, damn, they're stunning!'The Incredible Hulk' is action-packed and entertaining from beginning to end. The film also has emotional depth, making me root for the Bruce Banner/Hulk all the way. The love interest between Hulk and Betty (Liv Tyler) at times reminded me a bit of King Kong and his love for a woman. Tim Roth makes a credible villain, as Emil Blonsky, who becomes a creature himself, Abomination.The editing is good and the film is well-paced. There's a really exciting finale with mayhem galore! I love this film. This seriously is a lot of fun!","

"tareqzaghal","2 September 2023","I have more fond memories of watching this film as a kid than rewatching it after so long.It is perhaps the most skippable MCU film out of them all, in terms of how dissimilar it feels compared to other MCU entries. It plays closer to the early 2000's Fox Marvel films, and not in the good ways. The story is boring and drawn out, with a few interesting details throughout but overall really forgettable.I'm not a fan of Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, as I prefer Ruffalo's performance in The Avengers (2012) more, even though after that film Hulk gets completely forgotten about for the most part. This is a mostly forgettable film with a few interesting set pieces that hold it together such as the action scene in the middle of the film and the final one between Abomination and the Hulk.All the CGI has aged very poorly and looks like something out of a 2005 cinematic video-game trailer. It's not unwatchable, but definitely skippable and not that special at all.","

"Rectangular_businessman","20 July 2022","I never understood the hatred for Ang Lee's Hulk. Sure, it's a bit slow paced (Particularly, at the beginning) but I think it was a decent superhero flick, though not as good as it could have been.So in response to the backlash that movie received, this movie was made. It's more conventional and action-packed than Lee's version, but it's still an overlooked film in comparison with the popular Iron Man film from the same year.Th most memorable aspect from it was the fight scene between Hulk and Abomination near its end, but for most part, the film is rather average. Not bad, just average.Nowadays, the possibility of another solo Hulk film seems very unlikely, but maybe one day a future film might live up to the potential this character has.","

"chaos-rampant","20 September 2008","THE INCREDIBLE HULK on the other hand takes a hamfisted James Bond route. It somehow creates a sprawling adventure mess that takes us through a tired string of horribly cliché scenes from a Brazilian favela all the way to Broadway. As a result the only way this revamped HULK can sustain our interest is by staging bigger, louder and more CGI laden action scenes - by the time the Broadway showdown was in full swing I simply couldn't care less. As if the stock characters and stock dialogue weren't enough (we even get the stock zany NYC cab driver, a NYC establishing shot all by himself - where have I seen that before?!!), we have to further suffer through Liv Tyler's idea of acting - her mere presence on screen instantly makes a scene bland. In fact I wager that you could intercut a shot of Liv Tyler within every classic scene in the history of cinema and those scenes would be ruined beyond all recognition. Any attempts at humour or romance fall flat on their face, she has NO chemistry whatsoever with Ed Norton who in turn is in full paycheck mode. HULK is everything the superhero movies I saw as a kid were - exercises in shattered glass, broken walls and loud explosions. Beyond that the void. I would go as far as to say that it is *gasp* vapid drivel!!!!!","

"TalesfromTheCryptfan","19 June 2008","Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is on the run from the authorities after conducting an experiment to himself to become a rampaging green yet gentle brute called Hulk (Voiced by Lou Ferrigno) and has hidden away in Brazil to be alone where he won't cause accidents and searches for a cure. However, General Ross (William Hurt) has discovered where he is as he sends out his soldiers to take him alive so they can conduct experiments to make super soldiers. As Banner returns to the U.S., he is reunited with his love Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) but unleashes his rage on some soldiers but Betty is the only one that can calm the creature down. KBG agent Emil Bronsky (Tim Roth) conducts an experiment on himself with some of the same gamma that made the Hulk to transform himself into a hideous beast called The Abomination whom starts a rampage in New York City, only Banner with his inner-monster must stop it.Exciting and action-packed reboot of the 2003 Ang Lee effort which wasn't too bad but could have been better as this one was an improvement. Director Louis Leterrier and star Edward Norton made a film that is more true to the comics and the 1977 classic TV show, the special effects are a vast improvement with the Hulk looking more realistic and less cartoonish this time. The action is non-stop and there's also some emotion as well as it makes the viewer relate to the characters, look for appearances by Stan Lee with Lou Ferragino and Robert Downy Jr. as Tony Stark.Nice to see Marvel is getting back on track with their movies and this with ""Iron Man"" are a prime example, this is a must see experience.","

"jon.h.ochiai","17 June 2008","Poised in a helicopter high above the city, prepared to risk perhaps certain death in saving it, Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) tells the love of his life Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), ""Betty, I've gotta try"" ""The Incredible Hulk"" is the compelling hero story reinvented with a yearning love story in the foreground. The action is visually enthralling, and the Hulk himself is amazingly ferocious with ripped muscles and veins. Unlike the previous incarnation, ""The Incredible Hulk"" has a sense of humanity and pathos. Director Louis Leterrier (of the ""Transporter"" movies) and Writer Zak Penn (of the ""X-Men"" movies) have reinvented ""The Incredible Hulk"" as an exploration into the darkness of human nature all in the context of a brilliantly orchestrated action movie. Understandably, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is based on a comic book which had the pretense of retelling the story of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"". However, there is something noble in Bruce Banner's (Norton) journey to control the great anger and power within himselfThe Hulk. In that regard-- Edward Norton is powerful. His compelling performance humanizes and breathes compassion for a man coming to terms with his own darkness. Thankfully, those who saw Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" can finally forgive the sins of the predecessor.Leterrier and Penn's story begins with Banner in self-imposed seclusion in Rio de Janeiro. Recall that scientist Bruce Banner exposed himself to gamma rays as part of experiments for the military. However, something went horribly wrong during a transient gamma ray exposure. Under great duress or anger Bruce transforms into the green skinned beastThe Hulk. The Hulk is a seemingly mindless enigma of rage and destruction. Bruce must find a cure for his affliction. In Brazil, Bruce may have made peace with the raging beast within. He meditates. He trains with his Brazilian Jujitsu Sensei (martial arts great Rickson Gracie) to find his path. Sensei tells Bruce, ""To control your anger, you must control your body."" Bruce works odd jobs at a bottling factory, while researching his own cure. His only regret in self imposed exile was forsaking his true love, Betty Ross (Tyler).While Bruce may have found some peace the world, the rest of the world will not let him be. In particular, General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt), who regards Bruce as missing government property, is determined to hunt Bruce and The Hulk down. Even Bruce realizes that he inadvertently participated in a covert ""weapon"" conspiracy. General Ross enlists the talents of expert soldier Emil Blonsky (cold blooded Tim Roth). The singular focused and ambitious Emil is not entirely what he seems. Realizing he is overmatched in capturing The Hulk, Emil willingly volunteers for an experimental ""super soldier"" program, so he can engage The Hulk. This of course leads to the unexpected outcome: The Abominationa creature perhaps stronger than The Hulk.The battle scenes with General Ross's army and The Hulk are visually stunning-- thunderous mayhem. Leterrier gets his job done. The battle between The Hulk and The Abomination is dramatic spectacle. My bud Ron, pointed out that their battle is reminiscent in scale of Godzilla, but sans the camp. Through all this Liv Tyler as Betty grounds the story with an emotional resonance. There is a quietly touching moment when Betty distinguishes Bruce in a bar and a great scene when she embraces Bruce in the down pouring rain. Edward Norton's quiet power is the soul of ""The Incredible Hulk"". Liv Tyler is its heart. She brilliantly captures Betty's resounding regret, knowing she can never be with the man she loves. Edward Norton embodies the hero's courage and nobility. He is awesome. Also amazing is William Hurt as General Ross, who will sacrifice his very humanity and family to obtain his objective. Hurt brings a keen focus and unmatched duplicity.Amidst the epic scale action, ""The Incredible Hulk"" tells the compelling story of a man's search for peace within himselfthe noblest of pursuits. Leterrier and Penn reinvent a classic hero tale. Edward Norton is powerful and amazing. ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a great movie.","

"krycek19","30 June 2008","Again it is beyond me, how poor taste in movies the users of IMDb, truly has. I did'nt like this movie very much. Maybe because I think The Hulk is probably the dumbest superhero ever made. A man that turns into a 10 feet tall green monster with an iq smaller than Homer Simpsons, whenever he gets angry. Its completely ridiculous. I hated the 2003 version and the only reason I wanted to see this was because of Edward Norton. I've always considered him one of the greatest actors of his generation. Unfortunately that does'nt show in this movie. Because Norton has so little to work with. He does'nt have many lines as Bruce Banner. Whenever he is not replaced by the cgi-Hulk, he is on the run. It's a very physical role and its disappointing, because it makes it hard to care about him. Tim Roths character is annoying and stupid and his motivation for hating Banner/Hulk is never explained. He just seems like a psychopath hellbent on killing Banner/Hulk. The general is frigging annoying too and his lack of compassion for Banner gives him almost no credibility at all. There are only two good things about this movie: the effects and the gorgeous Liv Tyler. And speaking of her, they even managed to ruin what could have been a love making scene with nudity from Tyler, because Banner can't even get sexily aroused without turning into The brain-dead Hulk. Some Marvel comics are just too dumb to be made into movies. The fantastic four is one of them, Hulk is another one.","

"disdressed12","18 June 2008","i liked the first live action hulk movie from 2003 somewhat,but this is an entirely different beast.for one thing,the story is much stronger and better developed.Edward Norton is fantastic as Bruce Banner,the hulk's alter ego.Liv Tyler is also strong as Betty Ross,Bruce's love interest.Tim Roth is also pretty good as a gung ho soldier recruited by General Thaddeus ""thunderbolt""Ross(William Hurt)to try and capture Banner/the hulk in hopes of finding a way to use Banner's affliction as a military weapon.in my mind Hurt gives the strongest performance in the movie.the action sequences are breath taking,and the hulk itself is much more gargantuan than in the 2003 version,although i think he actually looks a bit more cartoonish.the movie also pays tribute to the 1970's TV show at times,both in dialogue and in action.all in all, i had one heck of a good time here.for me,The Incredible Hulk is an 8/10","

"Ozzy2000","17 June 2008","Strangely enough Marvel has produced another film version of the Marvel Comic book hero, the Hulk. It is difficult to compare the two they are both really good but the first one had arguably better CGI but the second had a more likable hulk. Of course all hulks need anger management and heaps of Valium rather than natural meditative techniques as we learn from the second version. Liv Tyler plays the romantic interest of Hulk played by Edward Norton. Liv attempts to play a demure delicate woman but instead appears very large, Amazonian and broad shouldered that makes the human hulk look really weak and effeminate maybe this was deliberate. The big showdown at the end of the film between the Hulk and the cheaper generic hulk imitation is very funny and enjoyable like world championship wrestling. There is also a cameo appearance of Mr Stark of Iron man played by Robert Downey Jnr. which implies very directly that the Hulk may join forces with Iron Man to defeat some crazy evil force in a sequel. I did note that the Hulk inducing chemicals were not destroyed so that may be the key to why there will be a follow up. I think the important thing in the next Hulk movie will be revolutionary stretch pants for the Hulk or maybe an ultra stretch leotard. I also think that an ultra stretch condom might also help a wee bit, the mind boggles.Anyway burnt out Baby boomers who saw the sixties TV version and much younger males really love these action movies and are forgiving with all the technical errors. Catch it while its on the big screen where the special effects are best seen.","

Well actually at first, we were going to see Indiana Jones but it was too late for that so we decided to see the Incredible Hulk. I wasn't really all that excited for this film because I wasn't a big fan of superhero movies like the Hulk but boy did it prove me wrong.This movie was awesome! The suspense kept me on the edge of my seat and the graphics were outstanding. Great acting by not just by Ed Norton but by Liv Tyler and the General {I think William Hurt} Kinda got confused in the beginning but I am sure glad we chose this movie.

"kosmasp","18 August 2008","After the disaster a few years ago (and I didn't even criticize the movie for it's lackluster CGI or the few action scenes it had, but you can read that in my ""Hulk"" comment somewhere else), Hulk finally arrived! This won't be the best movie you've ever seen, nor might it be the ultimate comic to film version, but it more than delivers on it's premise.You don't have to have watched Ang Lees Hulk to get into this movie, to understand it. There's a short intro, that does look a bit like it sums up the things that happened in ""Part 1"", although officially that movie won't be mentioned I guess. Ed Norton does know in what kind of movie he's in and plays it fairly straight. The (love) relationships work so much better and in more levels than those from Ang Lees Hulk, which didn't work at all.Of course the CGI has evolved and is up to another standard here. There is the odd cameo here and there (nicely done) and if you're an avid fan of the comics you will be more than pleased (as my friend who is a big fan unlike myself, told me)! But even if you're not into the comics, there's a great action movie to be seen here (with a slight addition of drama, just enough to not hurt the action part, but kind of elevate it).","

"sloopydrew","17 June 2008","Rebooting a franchise that was unsuccessfully rebooted only 5 years prior seems to be an incredible risk, but The Incredible Hulk proves that Marvel knows their material better than Ang Lee. While Lee's Hulk was a more ambitious, creatively daring picture, it just wasn't the Hulk fans know from the comics. The Incredible Hulk, on the other hand, is as comic-book as a comic-book movie can get. That's not to say it's the best comic-book movie ever made (far from), but by the time it's over you'll be tempted to wipe quad-colored ink from your fingertips.This is a big, loud celebration of the green behemoth and all the toys that he loves to smash. The first action sequence featuring Hulk himself is one of the better staged action scenes of the summer -- if not the year. The hulking hero is introduced to us just right. He's an angry monster in the shadows. A glimpse of something moving in split second sprints caught only by your peripheral vision. His introduction had me thinking Hulk as a horror movie may be the best idea ever. But that would, once again, go against the Hulk fans know from the comics.This movie is nothing if not fan service. Stan Lee shows up (in more ways than one). Lou Ferrigno has a memorable moment. They even manage to work in a cameo for deceased actor Bill Bixby. If you're a die-hard fan of the comics and don't like this movie, you accidentally stumbled into Sex and the City.Marvel goes as far as to make the same mistakes as they do in the comics -- the climax is too hectic to be enthralling and the last 20 minutes are as busy setting up a sequel, a spin-off and a crossover as they are a decent finale to a once entertaining movie. Still, complaints aside, this is a fun movie for the fans and this review could have been just as easily summed up in 2 words: HULK SMASH!","

"inkblot11","8 October 2008","Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) has been living in a barrio in Brazil for the last year. This is because he is a wanted man, after a laboratory accident that went awry. As you may have heard, Banner was exposed to gamma radiation and when he is overly ""excited"", he turns into a nearly all-powerful monster called the Hulk. In his monstrous form, he killed several folks in the United States. But, unbelievably, that is not exactly why he is being pursued. A bonehead military man, Ross (William Hurt) is after Banner so that Bruce's blood can be used to generate another super-being, rendering the American army invincible. Ross' beautiful daughter, Elizabeth (Liv Tyler), a biology professor, was once involved with Banner and is still the object of the fugitive's affections. To help capture Banner, the elder Ross enlists the aid of a Russian-turned-Brit, Rambo-type (Tim Roth) who is very successful at snaring his prey. But, Banner still has a few tricks up his sleeve, as he seeks the aid of an online scientist who may have a cure for his condition. So, who will emerge victorious, Banner or his misguided seekers? This is a good film with unbelievably great special effects and a wonderfully touching performance by Norton. It is on these two strengths that the film succeeds, for the script is uneven and inferior, the direction is one-handed and the events a series of implausibilities. No, it is not the science that is lacking, it is the supposed intelligence of the military. Knowing what this man-monster can do, how could anyone possibly believe that humans could claim victory? Yet, Hurt's character is built on that misguided belief. As stated, Norton is a wonder, for he infuses his character with courage, smarts, and sensitivity. The rest of the cast is quite fine, too, as Tyler, Hurt, and Roth fulfill their roles nicely and the lesser actors do a good job as well. The opening chase scene in the barrio is exciting, even though the viewer feels Banner was deliberately placed in Brazil so that the scene could happen. All other scenery is quite wonderful, too, as the viewer is transported to Guatemala, Mexico, D.C. and even to British Columbia. Costumes are fetching but of small importance. Noteworthy, too, are the fabulous special effects, as Banner's transformation into the Hulk is most impressive and the havoc that ensues when he is in action is mind-boggling. However, the storyline is not worthy of such dazzlement, being, virtually, one long hunting excursion. Should one skip it? No, not at all, as it has enough good elements to make it worthwhile. But, it is far below the bar set by such wonderful movies as this summer's Iron Man or the original Batman.","

"harry_tk_yung","14 June 2008","""Roaring"" is a deliberate reference to what the Hulk did, maybe a couple of times too many, in the movie.As Ang Lee's version of the thinking man's Hulk a few years ago quickly proved to be lethal for the box office, Hollywood clearly thought that the green monster is too much of a golden goose to abandon. When a suitable opportunity arises with the Marvel Comic revival, they bring him back, in a one-two punch release led by Iron Man. The rest is history.This current version of Hulk has ""mainstream"" and ""popular entertainment"" written all over it. Handled deftly by the filmmakers, it starts with an efficient and economical establishing sequence of montages that doubles up with the opening credit, giving you the full background (or as much as you need to know anyway) of the story. The real opening sequence starts with Bruce Banner's hideout in Brazil and ends with the US army's special squad trying to take him in. This is as exciting as anything you've seen on screen, culminating in Banner's transformation into Hulk. The rest of the movie, which I'm not going to describe here, is somewhat predictable which doesn't mean to say that it is not entertainingly exciting. Even more predictable is of course the unspoken message: keep an eye open for the sequel.While not as brilliant as Iron Man, this movie scores well above passing grade in every categorie essential for a box office success, starting with one of the best actors around today  Edward Norton. The rest of the cast goes from good to adequate: (in that order) Tim Roth, William Hurt, Liv Tyler and some others. CGI is good but if you tell yourself that you have not seen better, you either watch very few movies in this genre or are deceiving yourself. Ditto for cinematography. Script (with a good sprinkle of humour), editing and sound all contribute to one single objective  making this a very entertaining comic-adapted action sci-fi thriller.Is there anything that makes this one stand out? To me, there are two that are worth mentioning. The first is what Ebert describes as the ""City of God"" neighborhood in the opening sequences, the real thing, not CGI generated, as he intimated in his review. The movie makers have spared no pain in capturing this stunning (in more ways than one) Brazilian neighborhood in as many angles as you can imagine, panoramic as well as microscopic, sweeping as well as stationary. This is a scene that I shall remember for a long time. The other thing is the character Emil Blonsky, a pure fighter in every drop of his blood, lamenting that as his experience accumulates, his body (mid-forties) deteriorates. The substance that makes Hulk what he is becomes Blonsky's salvation. In one way, we can look at the movie as pivoted on three duels between Blonsky and Banner. The first one is no contest, their first encounter in Brazil when Blonsky leads a special squad to round up Banner, only to find him turning into Hulk. But even than, Blonsky shows a fighting spirit that looks like sheer madness. The last duel, albeit the climax, is all CGI. It's the middle one that is absolutely brilliant, because it ingeniously reverses the roles of David and Goliath. Blonsky has been injected by the army with some of the substance, making him stronger, faster, but still essentially a human being in form. In this, essentially still a no-contest duel, I find myself rooting for the ""little guy"" (literally, by comparison) rather than the hero Hulk who looks a bit like big, bad and bullying. Tim Roth, Quentin Tarantino's favorite (one of them anyway), is excellent as Blonsky and deserves more credit than he seems to be been given in this movie.","

"Scelestus-1","20 June 2008","I loved it. I missed the last 10 or 15 minutes because a determined girlfriend thought it was stupid, but she thinks most things are indeed stupid. I'm even definitively stupid, so her opinion goes out the window right NOW.The original hulk was a foul waste of time, and while it failed to please us, it cleared the path of Hulk's origins to give us the clash of the Hulk and Abomination. There are many little details just waiting in here, and if you catch them, it adds to the experience greatly. It has love, humor, action, suspense. Everything the Hulk can be counted on for, and then a bit more after that.Even better, while in the original the Hulk was a very flat green, just very very big, this time he's got more veins than a steroids addict. It's amazing to see the detail on the characters, the plot and even the jokes.","

"kylehodgdon","12 February 2010","For everything that was wrong with 2003's ""Hulk"", 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk"" does right. It's kind of too bad that this movie came out right after the blockbuster ""Iron Man"" because it kind of became a bit overlooked. I did like ""Iron Man"" just a tad more than this, but only by a small amount. This was every bit as much an awesome superhero movie that ""Iron Man"" was. Most people are somewhat familiar with Hulk, so they did not start this story with the birth of the Hulk character. Instead they could really start the story off quickly. I think that was a good idea. We saw that in ""Hulk"" and it was not necessary to show it again. I thought Edward Norton played a great Bruce Banner. Liv Tyler also played a very good Betty Ross. Unlike the 2003 Hulk, this one really looked much, much better. Not only did his look improve, but his actions had more power than the 2003 version. The Hulk character is a tough one to make a story around since his power only works when he is angry, so I was impressed that this story really made sense and was very good.The Abomination character was also done very well. To me, it might take a certain kind of enemy for the Hulk character to have and they nailed it with him.The final scene of the film definitely made me very anxious to see more Marvel films, especially the one that will cap them all off: The Avengers.","

The same constructs we've seen in dozens if not hundreds of other movies are rehashed, and why? Because what can you really do with a raging bullfrog on steroids? A second, even bigger, bullfrog? A Dr.Jekyll & Mr.Hyde meets Beauty & the Beast in stretchy pants? The thinking man's King Kong on a self-help quest? They just can't help but fall back on the same clichés and feeble structure with good ol' time-warps to fast-track to the climatic fight scene -and prep it up for the sequel before rolling the credits. Depravity is when you have a super-bezerking giant on a havoc-spree toned down to pg-13. One-liners as motives for us to swallow; ""You don't deserve the power!"" and so much homage-fromage as filler, it's downright cannibalistic.Cheesy hilights...Two-dimensional bad-ass co-workers, what would heroes do without them? The babe they harass comes across as a cowering doe, nothing wrong with that I guess...Overnight the Hulk runs from Rio to Guatemala, that's more or less from New York to Alaska. But he panhandles/walks the rest of the way home...General-Colonel-whatever, answers to no one, heads his own shop for years on end, runs a military op in Brazil, on university grounds, NYC, no inquiries, no hell to pay, nada... 'Stanley' (clever, eh) the pizza-place... every home-coming-hero-on-the-run has one, older guy with a spare room upstairs, money to lend, keeps a tab on everyone- Banner; Is she seeing someone..? Stanley; ""He's a head-shrink. They say he's one of the best(sic).. but a really nice guy..."" (thank-you, Stanley..)Bribing a security guard with a free pizza to not catch hell for a non-delivery on a pizza? Bribing another guy in the computer lab with second pizza..? How gullible and gluttonous and famished and broke must regular folks be made out to be...?Betty's tag-along setup - ""Well, at least let me walk you to the station."" Swallowing the disk-on-key before turning into the Hulk, how would Banner know the Hulk's stomach juices wouldn't dissolve or at least ruin it? Of course the Hulk can't outright kill any foot-soldier, his rage is against machinery, movie-taboo exception would be anyone within contraption such as the helicopter crew...Pawning a necklace to buy a second-hand pickup and pay for gas, they abandon the wheels because of roadblocks into NYC and then pay off some other guy to ferry them across... and then pay some maniac cab-driver for another, mindless, hi-speed sequence... Abomination swatting all them blind pedestrians- blind because they're impervious to his standing there, his motive; looking for a real fight... soldiers trying latest shoulder-missiles, they don't work so they drive in reverse till they bump into pile-up, cab driver (must be that same maniac) drives right into 12' monster, fear-stricken soldiers stay in place while Abomination goes 'give me a real fight' before slamming cab into them... The helicopter crash-lands into the church ruins, but try as they might to get out, an unconscious/dead soldier is propped in the only opening so that Betty exasperates in her struggle to escape as the fuselage catches fire (only for Hulk to hand-clap it out)...For all the violence they inflict one on the other, and for all their super-strengths, it's an indestructible chain that allows the Hulk to subdue Abomination. And it's Betty that stops the Hulk from killing him, he's vanquished, right, so just let him be...they'll super-handcuff his ass to a super-cell till the sequel...Every such finale must entail a crowd, no matter how preposterous for people to show up. Hulk departs a la Spidey minus cobwebs... aaga-gaga-gaga...","

"r96sk","14 January 2021","Much more enjoyable than the 2003 film, which this 2008 release reboots. So that's a positive. As for a follow-up in the MCU, it's a little underwhelming if still passably good - at least to me.'The Incredible Hulk' is closer to being forgettable than it is to being memorable, but that's not to say I didn't have a solid time watching. It's only really the ending that I felt dragged, yet even then it still has positive moments.I liked Edward Norton's performance for the most part, particularly early on in South America. Tim Roth is good too, though a few of his scenes irritated me slightly - perhaps more to do with how the film uses him, rather than what Roth does himself. There are a few others, but those two are the most standout.I did expect more, but there's enough there that I rate.","

Shallow writing, unnecessary, irritating one-liners, and lack-lustre directing, all held together with overblown CGI. This film, however, has everything that MCU should have kept for its superhero franchise---serious writing, a stellar cast of straight actors, a depth and adult-like darkness to the story, very intelligent use of CGI with well choreographed, underplayed action sequences, and ALL the heart of the original seventies TV series. Not entirely a candy floss film for kids.","

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","18 June 2008","After about 15 minutes of ""The Incredible Hulk,"" I easily tossed aside and deserted all thoughts and pre-existing connections to Ang Lee's 2003 ""Hulk"" and willingly accepted this film's complete makeover--that's how much better this film is than Hulk's first cut on the big screen. Writer Zak Penn and director Louis Leterrier's depiction of the green giant makes for a much more exciting action film and is way more believable. ""The Incredible Hulk"" epitomizes summer blockbuster while staying comic-friendly and not being completely devoid of audience empathy.""Incredible Hulk"" picks off where 2003's Hulk left off, but basically rewrites everything up to that point. Banner is in hiding from the U.S. military, trying to find ways of controlling his anger/heart rate so he never becomes the Hulk, and in the meantime communicating secretly with a scientist who might be able to help him cure his condition. When General Ross (Hurt), who wants Banner for his blood to make it into a weapon, finds where Banner is hiding, the fun begins.The plot is rather cyclical in that Ross tries to hunt down Banner three different times and then the Hulk gets away. Each time is a bit different, mostly because one decorated military soldier (Tim Roth) begins taking Ross' ""supersoldier"" serum in effort to bring the Hulk down and eventually his lust for strength turns him into the Abomination. It's not a great plot, but it's straightforward, really easy and exciting to follow, very comic-like, and we can identify with Banner's need to find a cure for the uncontrollable beast inside him.Norton is infinitely better than Bana as Bruce Banner. The writing for his character is so much better to begin with--you actually get the sense that he's fighting the Hulk and you see the connection between Banner and this alter ego. They don't feel completely separate from one another, which is something ""Hulk"" of 2003 never did. Ang Lee gave us more introspective Hulk, but Leterrier gives us some of that in addition to a Hulk that is more fierce, visceral and untamed. The CGI is more realistic and Leterrier does a much better job at showing how inadvertently destructive the Hulk really is and why Banner wants it to go away.The action in this film is top notch in both live action and CGI. Especially at the beginning it feels like a mix between superhero films and the ""Bourne"" movies. Marvel made a bold move bringing in ""Transporter 2"" director Leterrier, but Leterrier's command of action makes this film great in at least that aspect alone. The action is brutal and relentless, never going soft which is exactly what you want from a movie about an uncontrollable green monster, especially one who fights an even crazier monster at the end. This kind of action is incomparable to any superhero film I've seen and that's a credit to Leterrier.The script only scratches the surface thematically in terms of Bruce's struggle, but it's enough to like and care about his character and let the action do the rest. You really get to know Norton's Banner and that's what matters. My other beefs with the film (Liv Tyler's mediocrity, Roth's dialogue, Abomination talking too much) are not significant enough to knock the film from its solid action superhero film status. Ultimately, this film is very satisfying--the direction, the creative hands that the Hulk franchise is in (should it continue) is an extremely gratifying one.","

"freemantle_uk","21 June 2008","I have recently seen the Incredible Hulk and I found it to be an enjoyable film. In Britain the reviews were at best average, but I thought it was good, especially against the Ang Lee version.The plot of the film is that Bruce Banner already has the Hulk inside him and is on the run from the US government. He had settled in Brazil and lives in the slums of a city. He was working in a soft drinks factory and hadn't transformed into the Hulk in five months. However, he accidentally cuts himself and his blood falls into a bottle. After a man drinks from the bottle in the US General Ross, sends a team of Special Forces to capture him. In Brazil Banner is also trying to find a cure and was in contact with a scientist in the USA. He was able to reduct the gamma radiation in Banner's blood, but he needs data which Banner's can't provide. After the attack Banner decides to go back to America to get the data and his cure. He had to go to Virginia, to the University where he worked with Betty Ross and became the Hulk. He ends up battling the army on the campus, and both the Hulk and Betty are on the run, before heading off to New York to meet the scientist that could care Banner.At the same time Ross meets an experience army soldier, Emil Blonsky, a Russian-born British marine (the ultimate Hollywood bad-guy) and discovers he has an ambition to fight and becomes interested in the Hulk and wants to defeat him. Ross tells Blonsky about the Super-Soldier programme from World War 2 and starts to injection with a gamma based serum that makes Blonsky more stronger and powerful then any other soldiers and gives him rapid healing abilities. However he is still not strong enough to beat the Hulk. It is only when his mixes the Hulk's blood into his own that he becomes the Abomination, a very powerful monster. This events leads to an epic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination in Harlem.This film works because it doesn't take itself too seriously, doesn't deal with the father son relationship like in the Ang Lee version, has lots of actions and is influenced by the TV show. This film breaks away from the X-Men/Batman Begins approach of being as dark, serious and realistic as possible, and goes down the Spiderman/Iron Man idea of being a bit more fun. The Hulk looks better in this film, showing that he big and muscular and light green, compared to the bright green blob with a sad face in previous version. The action is better, even when the Hulk isn't involved, because there was a good chase scene in the Brazilian slums. I thought the Abomination looked really impressive, and the director, Louis Leterrier changed him from a reptilian to a bone like creature. This film also has better villains, the Abomination is a match for the Hulk and General Ross is more power mad in this version. I didn't like the fact that in the Ang Lee version the villain of the film was Bruce Banner's dad. I also felt that Ed Norton was better then Eric Bana as Bruce Banner.The film is also linked with other Marvel films, in the title sequence there is a mention of Stark Industries and Nick Fury. The super-serum from World War 2 is linked to Captain America which is going to be made into a film. Robert Downey Jr. also has a cameo as Tony Stark, and anyone who has seen the end sequence of Iron Man can guess what he is doing in the film, because it is going to be linked with the Avengers film that will be made. It is also hinted that the Leader is going to be a villain in the next film if it is made.There are problems, I find it totally unrealistic that the Hulk could travel from Brazil to Guatemala in a day, even with super-powers, and that it is unlikely that the Hulk could blow out a fire just by clapping his hands.The Hulk is however a good film, a solid 7.5 out of 10.","

"piksplanet","21 June 2008","The Incredible Hulk continues Hollywood's list of 2008 Summer Blockbusters, as it does the number of comic book to celluloid adaptations for the year. With Iron Man already smashing the box office to become the first film this year to get over the 200 million dollar revenue mark, and with Berg's Hancock, Del Toro's Hellboy 2 and Nolan's The Dark Knight to come out next month, The Incredible Hulk has a lot of expectations on its head, especially after the failure of Ang Lee's The Hulk, five years ago.Unlike in The Hulk, where Ang Lee put in a lot of effort to bring forward the origin of the Hulk, Louis Leterrier's new adaptation does that in less than 3 minutes via the opening credits. They probably did not want to show us what we had already seen and not appreciated in Ang Lee's version. There is no Nick Nolte here freaking us out with his creepy (not great!) performance as Bruce Banner's father. There are no gigantic poodles and bull dogs here. There film is not two hours and fifteen minutes long. It's doesn't even get to two. All that, added with a couple of good performances, great visuals, a gripping plot, and one helluva final showdown make The Incredible Hulk a brilliant movie! Louis Leterrier isn't a very well-known director. He directed The Transporter 2, and thats about all his resume says. The casting here is good. With Edward Norton capturing the essence of Bruce Banner very well. William Hurt gives us a the rather obsessive General Thadius Ross, where he acts like he owes no one nothing as long as he able to capture the green beast. Liv Tyler, however, is quite flat. Her dialogues don't really have any feeling in them. Now, I haven't seen Tim Roth in a long time. His portrayal of Emile Blonsky is the pick of the lot in this movie. Not only does he effectively act insane, but that part-Russian accent does wonders for him.What they did, and did correctly in this film was the fact that they gave us a very raw and very real Hulk. (Read: No clinging on to a fighter jet till he reaches space!). Although all of it is CGI, it is very well done. The effects are mindblowing. The expected showdown between Iron Man and Iron Monger which was given amiss by Jon Favreau in Iron Man, Marvel makes up for in The Incredible Hulk. The final fight between the Hulk and the Abomination is really something! Control - that is what the objective of this film is. How Bruce Banner takes control of the beast inside of him. He is desperately seeking an antidote, hiding from the Army, who have labeled him 'A fugitive who stole military secrets'. His living in tranquility for months and months so that he can grasp his anger instead of letting it lose. He even wears a heart-rate calculator. 'Can't get too excited', he says while on a kissing spree. Yes, it does have its fair share of comedy; and also eye-candy. Read: Débora Nascimento who plays Martina. She's there only in a few scenes.Incident - is what they call the transformation in this one. They even show you a timeline that says - Days since Incident. The shots of rural Brazil in the introduction of the film are very nice. The Hulk too seems more lifelike. Not as rubbery as he did in the previous adaptation. Also, The Incredible Hulk hints at a good many other films that could be in store for us. Tim Blake Nelson plays Samuel Sterns - The Leader, a character from Marvel. There is also a small cameo by Robert Downey Jr. And yes, he is Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man. The weapons too, if one notices, are all Stark Industry products. Who knows.. this film might be an excuse of a movie just to introduce numerous other adaptations. Think - The Avengers! The Incredible Hulk does justice to one of Marvel's most famous characters. Although unexpected since most associate it with a rather comedic version of the Hulk, we finally hear the green beast say 'Hulk Smash'. And he really does..8/10. Good. Very very good!","

"ODDBear","16 June 2008","This re-imagining of the green Goliath works far better than Ang Lee's 2003 outing, that's for sure. Being an avid admirer of the Bixby/Ferrigno series in the late seventies and early eighties I found this film to be closer in spirit to the series and I definitely liked that.The Hulk's origins are played out at the very beginning and once that's over and done with audiences are in for a fast paced and enjoyable ride. The film attempts to keep people who liked the series happy as well as the crowd who want it firmly rooted in Marvel tradition. The Hulk battles a foe called The Abomination in the final third, and by the way that fight is pretty awesome, and I gather that that's a person to be found in the original comics.While some aspects from the film can be linked to the original series, the characters here are from the comics. Here are General Ross and his daughter, who were also present in Ang Lee's version. The Hulk not only battles The Abomination but also the U.S. Army and that wasn't the case with the series. Banner did get captured by the army at one point but that was never a recurring thing.But a big thumbs up for the homages to the old series. Only a few minutes in we're greeted with a small tribute to the late Bill Bixby, as Norton switches channels in Brazil and watches for a few seconds an episode from ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"". Lou Ferrigno gets a small speaking part that comes off very well, a journalist named Jack McGee is mentioned and that envelope with ""David B."" was a nice touch. I think all the fans of the original series appreciated these little touches.While Eric Bana was one of the few things that was positive about Hulk (2003), Norton betters him here. He's such a natural performer and he can convey so much with mere expressions. He was the perfect choice to play Banner, in some ways he reminded me of Bixby. Tim Roth is one of those actors who's always good and he doesn't falter here. But William Hurt really surprised me. I've always thought he was good but I'd have to say this is his finest performance in many years. General Ross is a much better written character here than in the 2003 version and Hurt simply excels in the part.As for the CGI, they work really well. The Hulk looks extremely cool and far better here. He doesn't continue to grow as he gets angrier and while that may annoy some I actually found it a plus. And those huge leaps are history as well, he jumps far enough but nothing compared to Ang Lee's version.The Incredible Hulk does well what it intends to do which is entertain. It's full of action, very well acted and fairly well written overall.","

"MrPink08","1 July 2008","Edward Norton has always been my favorite actor, and here is one of the reason why: he can take crap and make it look good. Case in point: The Incredible Hulk. After the 2003 Ang Lee disaster, Norton stars and writes this superhero epic, which is just as good as its companion Iron Man, which I also loved. Norton makes us care about the Bruce Banner character. We actually want him to find a cure for his ""illness"" and not just break out into a Hulk fit at any random time.Instead of boring us with a dull backstory like Eric Bana's Hulk did, director Louis Lerterier (The Transporter) opts to show us the backstory in an opening montage during the credits. That way, we get right to the action. Bruce Banner (Norton) is living in Brazil, seeking a cure for his ""incident"". However, he is tracked down by General Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) and Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) who want to use Banner's substances to create ""supersoldiers"". Eventually, Blonsky takes some of the supersoldier serum and becomes like Banner, only evil. Banner teams up with girlfriend Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) and Dr. Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) to find a cure for his rage.In addition to Norton, it was nice to see Tim Roth finally get a starring role in a film not directed by Quentin Tarantino. Tyler portrays Betty well, and she and Norton have good chemistry on screen. Hurt's Ross was a huge improvement over Sam Elliot's, and Nelson is a fun character who comes off likable.Fans will love the cameos in this film as well. Tony Stark, aka The Invincible Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) shows up at the end, and Lou Ferrigno makes a cameo. But the real star is Norton and his big bad green self. A Perfect 10, and I cannot wait for The Avengers Movie.","

"the-gossip-king","2 July 2008","This movie was awesome! After the monstrosity that Ang Lee created in 2005's 'Hulk' I was really not expecting much from this movie but I got exactly what I wanted and more. Firstly for those complaining that the Hulk looks fake from the commercials, don't worry, he looks a lot better on the the big screen and so does the Abomination which is the villain for this piece. This movie succeeds action wise with some really good stunts and lengthy battle sequences to the point where I was never bored in this movie. The only problems i had with this movie were very minor. Firstly, the dialogue was very weak. I like Louis Leterrier's directing style but Zak Penn's screenplay was really weak. I like how they tried to quote some of the famous lines from the TV series eg. 'hulk smash!' but when you are making a live action superhero movie it does not fit. Another thing was William Hurt who I was if no one else was hoping to love in this movie because i think he is a terrific actor. It was not that he was wrong for the role, he was perfect but his acting was almost lazy. It felt like he was acting on the basis of 'oh its a superhero movie, who cares I am probably going to get a big paycheck.' Aside from this everything worked really well. Ed Norton was perfect as Bruce Banner and even though i liked Eric Bana and thought he did a good job, Norton kicks his ass! Awaiting this movie I was prepared to really hat Liv Tyler but she turned out to be better than expected. I am not going to go as far as saying she was better than Jennifer Connelly but it felt like she was giving this movie everything she had which the audience realized and appreciated. Overall, a definite see!","

Anyway, this is definitely one of the best origin story movies in the MCU. Hulk although became more ""personified"" in the latest movies, whenever I think of Hulk, it will always be this Hulk. Just pure anger.","

"Deckard-16","15 June 2008","Edward Norton is right & wrong. This movie could have used more of him in it (when the DVD comes out I hope they include ""his cut"" if it exist), but he is wrong for not promoting this movie.This re-boot is a blast to watch. I actually liked much of Ang Lee's version but only in fits & starts. This Hulk is a much smoother machine that never drags. The FX are spectacular & sometimes inspired --every part of the production is great. The battle scenes are ferocious. I never tired of watching Mean Green do his thing, but I guess thats the point. The movie makers knew when to cut the action.However --like Iron Man-- the acting is way above average for this sort of escapism, but, come to think of it, all 3 Spideys & X-Men + Batman Begins (& Returns) also featured really fine & often great acting. AND this Hulk could've used more of it. Norton is 1 of the top 5 actors currently working. There are moments in this movie when his talent really pays off and they are all too brief. William Hurt makes a fine foe. And, so help me movie gods, Liv Tyler gives a memorable performance although she is mostly stuck saying the name ""Bruce"".Overall this movie ROCKS.And I thought all movies released b4 July 18th were just time-killers until the Dark Knight arrives. Thank you Tony Stark, Indy & Bruce Banner for proving me wrong.","

"generationofswine","16 November 2016","It's darker than the Hulk and that works well. Darker as in literally darker, darker as in it is dark enough to hide a lot of the CGI that made The Hulk look fake and boring in the action.It also has a better cast. Anyone that has seen The Avengers is going to prefer Mark Ruffalo, because he nailed the part, but Edward Norton is leagues better than Eric Bana. So now you have a Bruce Banner that can actually add depth to the role, something that was seriously lacking in The Hulk.Liv Tyler as well is a breath of fresh air given that Jennifer Connolly seemingly needs the tightest of scrips to actually emote and Tyler can act even in the worst of films. For her playing a believable Betty was a lot better than Connolly's cardboard cut out.The approach was refreshing for a comic book movie. We've seen the Wayne's get killed over and over again, we've seen Uncle Ben die too often for his own good. We've seen the introductory stories told so often we can repeat them with our eyes closed.The Incredible Hulk assumes that we already know how things came to be and doesn't spend a life time retelling the same old story. It starts off assuming that the foundations are well in place in the minds of the audience and that allows the movie to come in on its own.We have more movie than rehash in the Incredible Hulk and that too adds to its charm.Still, you are ultimately going to get a lot of mindless carnage and that can be a bit...dull after a while.On the whole though, The Incredible Hulk succeeds where the Hulk failed.","

"simonparker1990","12 June 2008","Ang Lee's movie Hulk received an extremely mixed reception upon its release in 2003. While it did deliver as a drama, and the performances were pretty good, as a Hulk movie it kind of left out the Hulk, we barely saw the big green giant, and for a comic book that took pride in Hulk smashing it really didn't feature an awful lot of it. I suppose it's no surprise that Ang Lee's version has almost been ignored, it wasn't a commercial movie, and while I appreciated moments of it the movie just really wasn't a Hulk movie. So The Incredible Hulk is rebooting the entire series, while its not a complete start over like Batman Begins it just seems like a fresh new break. And what a fresh break it is, The Incredible Hulk basically smooths over every flaw the original movie had yet maintains the quality drama from the first movie. But most importantly of all, Hulk finally smashes! The final fight sequence is pretty much one of the highlights of this year so far, it is truly incredible. The performances are also an improvement, Edward Norton being a much more accurate interpretation of Bruce Banner, Liv Tyler being superb as Betty Ross and Tim Roth, well just being downright brilliant on lead villain duties. Sure the movie essentially is a big dumb popcorn flick, but its also an extremely well made one. In fact I actually preferred it to Iron Man, although both are still some of the best superhero movies to date and both show a great improvement in terms of Marvel adaptations.So let me go more in-depth with the performances. Edward Norton really hit the core of Bruce Banner. I had nothing wrong with Eric Bana's portrayal in the original movie, but he just didn't suit the character as well as Norton does. Norton seems more the geeky scientist desperate for a cure, a man desperate to stop his inner self. The scenes at the beginning where he tries to control himself show a great performance from Norton, and the scenes he shares with Liv Tyler are touching. That leads me onto Tyler's performance, and I'd go as far to say she delivers the best performance in the movie. The scene where she finally sees Bruce again is brilliantly done, its done in a subtle way, but Tyler's performance just makes it all the better. A later scene in a helicopter with the pair is the highlight of their chemistry and one of the highlights of the movie. William Hurt is a great general in the movie, both villain and victim to an extent, Hurt really characterises a possibly two-dimensional character. And then there is Tim Roth, the caged animal of an actor who does villains like no other. He is brilliant, snarling constantly and wanting to more than he could ever be. The scenes before he literally turns into an ""Abomination"" show a brilliant performance from him, and makes it all the more apparent how the original movie lacked a suitable villain for the Hulk.But the main thing people want to know is how good is the actual Hulk in the movie. The CGI I thought was great, sure its not the best CGI in the world, but I began to believe he was there and the transformation sequences were extremely well done. But what Hulk does best in this movie is smash his way around. The three key fight sequences all being noteworthy, but the final just being stunning. The best scene in the movie, two words, ""Hulk Smash!"" I literally had a chill up my spine when I saw the scene and finally made me realise how happy I was to see the big green hero in all his glory in the big screen, and done well. The drama side of the movie is also done extremely well, in some ways it was done even better than Ang Lee's movie. The relationship between Bruce and Betty being vital to the movie, there scenes together are so well written and believable it really hits the heart. The movie also has a sense of humour, the best being Banner trying to keep calm in a New York cab. I suppose the biggest surprise of the movie is the fact the Hulk doesn't have to be on-screen to keep our attention, and that makes this the brilliant film that it is. Like Iron Man, Batman Begins and Spiderman 2 there are superb moments where we don't see the hero or the villain, there are moments that are small, subtle, yet brilliant. This makes this one of the best comic book adaptations to date, and one of the bigger surprises of the Summer.Overall The Incredible Hulk is a truly incredible reboot for a series I wasn't convinced could survive after Lee's movie. However this movie is stunning in almost every way. Its one of the best movies of the summer I have seen so far and definitely one of the largest surprises I have seen so far. I urge you to watch it, and prepare to see a proper Hulk movie.","

It had terrible special effects and bad acting this one changes all of that because the new actors did better and it wasn't just some cheesy special effects but more realistic.

"eric262003","22 February 2010","Scoot over Spider-Man and all your other appalling sequels, there's a big, scary green man taking over. No it's not the jolly green giant on a vegetable shortage, it's another one of Stan Lee's creations that has become an icon in the superhero industry, the one and only, ""The Incredible Hulk"". When I left the theaters I'm pretty sure the reception was positive or satisfying to say the least. Who could blame them? With an outstanding plot, Edward Norton's amazingly breath-taking performance, the action that's always exciting, what's there to hate? This movie exceeds everything the original Hulk with Eric Bana in many of the essential ingredients that makes movie-making successful.What scenes developed in the Eric Bana version was accomplished at a much shorter time in Edward Norton's version and more effectively. It gives you that extra boost as we see our hero who's running from the American government in South America. Nothing better than watching one monster collide with another one. He's not doing to flex his muscles and to look scary, but he's doing it to save his girlfriend and to protect humanity in every way possible. The message is quite sublime, you can see it to believe it.I can't blame Eric Bana entirely why the acting in ""The Hulk"" was revolting. He showed his acting skills wonderfully in ""Troy"",so what went wrong? In ""The Incredible Hulk"", the love story was more immaculate and the dialogue was handled with more believable quotes from Mr. Norton and Liv Tyler. Norton is just an amazingly talented performer and his delivery of lines was simply poetic. There was a bit of humour thrown in for good measure, but unlike ""Transformers"", the one-liners were sporadic and not over-the-top silly.The newly transformed Hulk looks more real and not heavily saturated in cheesy CGI. Even the design has more human looks than computerized adding effect to the fighting scenes. The action scenes were perfectly choreographed and the real-life Hulk design made it all the more possible.I must say this is a great film to enjoy and a complete makeover from the abomination that was ""The Hulk"". I even had low expectations when seeing this movie, after watching ""The Incredible Hulk"" I was really marveled by the experience (pun intended).","

"he_who_leads","31 October 2008","As many know, Ang Lee and Eric Bana tried to do a Hulk movie in 2003. It didn't work. Brooding and arty with limited action. So this time around they went for a ""reboot"" - new director and cast and approach. For other movies, the word 'reboot' means an update from what we've seen before. For 'The Incredible Hulk', reboot simply means getting back to the basics - more action and a brisk and easy to follow story. In other words, this aims to be be meat and potatoes and that is what it is.This movie offers up much that is good and solid but not spectacular. The plot is simply designed to enable what we want to see. Nearly all the cast do fine. I wouldn't mind seeing them reprise their parts in any future movies. However, I'm not 100 percent sold on Edward Norton as Bruce Banner / The Hulk. He's a fine actor and there's nothing wrong with his acting here. It's just his approach to the character. Bruce here is quite solemn and repressed. He seems to be thinking deeply about his predicament, but not really in a battle to control his rage. Therefore, it never really feels like a smooth transition whenever he transforms into the Hulk. His chemistry with Liv Tyler's Betty Ross is pretty good though.On the action front, the film is very good. It gives us what we want to see. A whole lotta Hulk Smash! The finale is definitely kickass and The Hulk versus The Abomination delivers. The film ends fairly abruptly after that. Now that we've had two movies in close succession basically introducing The Hulk and the major characters, now is the time to move on and start pushing this series into high gear.","

"poem","23 July 2008","So Arwen is back and this time she's even with an Orc. Optically, Liv Tyler looks even more like an elf now, than ever before, with her really extremely long face. People might criticize her acting, but its hard to look good next to a Edward Norton, and personally I didn't mentioned any flaw at all in it; for me, she was totally believable.Criticizing Edward Norton would probably be a sacrilege by now. The legitimate successor of Robert de Niro, the man who can play a tree (de Niro about de Niro), is of course again far beyond any criticism in his acting skills. I thorough enjoyed his interpretation of Hulk.Tim Roth also does a good work as usual, even if his character was rather one dimensional. The story is not record breaking, but was definitely okay. All in all the movie was about as good or bad as Iron Man, but couldn't reach the level of the Spiderman Trilogy or the new Batman movies, due to lack of depth in the story. It definitely has a much, much, much better romance than the last of these movies, though.What really enraged me was the fact that they cut so much of the showdown. Cant mention details to avoid spoilers, but the German version was nothing short of butchered in this respect; the German viewer really had no idea whatsoever how the villain was finally brought down.","

"madbandit20002000","1 July 2008","When the huge, jade-skinned, sometimes anti-heroic behemoth, conceived by visionaries at Marvel Comics, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, got the movie treatment in 2003, fans a many were stoked to see the Incredible Hulk in full, CGI action. However, the film by celebrated filmsmith Ang Lee (""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") was a wooden penny. Hulk dogs? The Hulk's dad becomes The Absorbing Man? The madder the Hulk gets, the bigger he gets? I'm just glad I save my money.I didn't, however, when viewing the recent comic book hero cine-relaunch (Batman being the first) which is a fun, rock'em, sock'em balance of human drama and high-edge action-adventure, the comic book and the classic TV series starring Bill Bixby as the tormented, gamma radiation-infested nuclear scientist, Dr. Bruce Banner and Lou Ferrigno as the not-so-Jolly Green Giant alter-ego. Compromising coolness is here for a superhero that can't take off the costume and call it a day, and that's what makes ""The Incredible Hulk"" interesting.Oscar nominee Edward Norton (""Fight Club"", ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt"") fills the late Mr. Bixby's shoes, perfectly and hauntingly, being on the lam from the protocol-minded General Thaddeus E. ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (a no-nonsense William Hurt). All Banner wants is a cure, but Ross and field soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Youth Without Youth"") makes things difficult, especially when Blonsky takes a ""super solder"" formula (a major hint to fanboys) to match monster brawn with the Green-skinned Goliath, and their fracas elevates to a monster mash in NYC's Harlem district. Good thing old Doc has the general's daughter, Betty (a mousy but lively Liv Tyler of the Lord of the Rings saga), as moral support and her heart as well.It's rare that movie producers can admit a ""mea culpa"" (money and rep, I guess), and ""The Incredible Hulk"", a combo of the Jason Bourne films and ""King Kong"", works. Director and fan Louis Lettierer (""Transporter 2"", ""Unleashed"" and an aide on the indie crime drama ""Gravesend"") does the script (a lost, first draft of the TV show's pilot episode, due to budget constraints and unavailable technology? ) by fellow fans Norton (uncredited) and Zak Penn (the second and third X-Men films) justice. Exceptional are the cast, especially Ty Burrell (the short-lived sitcom, ""Back To You"") and Tim Blake Nelson (""O Brother, Where Art Thou"") whose roles hint at a sequel (Like, duh). More eye winks towards fanboys are the cameos of Stan Lee, Ferrigno, Bixby (from an episode of ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"") and Robert Downey Jr. as his Tony Stark role from the super-hit ""Iron Man"", clueing into the Marvel Comics Universe. (Take heed, DC Comics and Warner Bros. Pictures). ""The Incredible Hulk"" does more than entertain; IT SMASH!!!","

Not that I dislike Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, I think he did a great job before Ruffalo took on the role, and the special effects still hold up very well. But later MCU movies found a certain formula that give them a sort of 'epicness' this movie could have used to bring it to an even higher level. That said, I still really recommend it as is.","

"RainDogJr","20 June 2008","First, I have seen only parts of Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk but never complete so if you want comparisons I can't give that to you. That said, let's focus on Louis Leterrier's The Incredible Hulk; even that this film is like a reboot it begins more like a sequel, actually when Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is already in his ""exile"" due to his ""green"" problem. During his stay in Brazil, he has an accident that will put him again on the map of the US Army (in part courtesy of Stan Lee). Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) is their ""special weapon"" and now we have just a search of Banner, who travels from Brazil to Guatemala to Mexico to finally the United States. There he meets again his love, Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), and the rounds between Hulk and the Army really begins. The visual part is great and delivers a terrific Hulk and a terrific fight at the University. Tim Roth's character seems to be in personal fight against Hulk but at this point of the film, he is the only one who really believes that. I mean, the guy claims ""well this is our second round"" or something like that but actually he hasn't even touch Hulk during their first meet in Brazil and in the University Hulk beats him easily (funny scene by the way). Of course when Abomination finally appears, courtesy of Banner's helper Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson), Hulk will have a true rival. Both deliver pure action in the climax of the film, and the entire film is just that: pure and fun action entertainment that, I guess, will be enjoyed by the true fans of the comic book.Cast: For me Norton was a great choice for the role because he normally looks as a very calm guy like Banner, when he is in a sort of hangover after being Hulk all night, but sometimes Norton looks quite different for stronger roles (for example in American History X as Derek Vinyard). Tim Roth is also quite good, again on a blockbuster, and for me to have him in the cast is enough to can say that this Hulk has a better cast that the 2003 Hulk. Before this film, I haven't see Liv Tyler since Lord of the Rings: The Return of the Kings and here she looks beautiful as usual but her role is quite common yet I think she is just good. Two cameos: Lou Ferrigno appear as a security guard and also voices Hulk (I saw this dubbed in Spanish so I didn't heard Lou) and Stan Lee has his obligated cameo in Brazil. Robert Downey Jr. is also here as Tony Starks, Avengers?Conclusion: Another enjoyable and entertaining film by Louis Leterrier. Another enjoyable and entertaining blockbuster and another fun Marvel world adaptation. Now let's see that Kung Fu panda.","

"invisibleunicornninja","18 March 2018","Effects - The character design of the Hulk is absolutely terrible. I was laughing every time he was onscreen. This movie is worth watching all the way through just to see the awful CG fight in the finale. Its absolutely hilarious. The effects in this film are the very definition of ""dated.""Characters - A lot of the acting was ok. None of it was too terrible, but there aren't really any great performances in this movie. The characters themselves aren't very interesting and are best described as ""passable."" Bruce Banner on his own is a bit boring. I don't think that he works well as a main character. Plot - This movie is drawn out. Most of the scenes are too long, and there are a few that could've been cut. There is a lot of stupid in this movie as well. If this movie was shorter, it probably would've been a bit less boring. Cinematography - There are a lot of interesting shots in this movie. The way this movie looks (aside from the effects) is probably the best thing about this movie. Visually, this movie is fantastic. Score - The soundtrack for this movie is absolutely terrible. Some people underestimate the power of good music. If someone competent was writing the composition for this movie, it would've been so much more entertaining. The music in this movie is so boring. It takes away from any of the excitement there is to be had.Overall this movie is teetering on the edge of boredom and fun. This movie suffers from a bloated runtime and a bad soundtrack. That being said, I was entertained. This isn't the worst movie ever, but its also not anything special. If you like this character or this franchise then go see it. Otherwise I'd recommend skipping it.","

"stallone-9","24 June 2008","This was without a doubt one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen simply because it is awesome to see one of your favorite comic book characters on the big screen in all his might.The 2003 version was beyond disappointing because it was far from the source material,too long and boring and of course not enough Hulk smash action.Thank God director Louis Leterrier fixed the mistakes Ang Lee made and created one of the best comic adaptations ever.The cast is great and Eddy Norton once again proves he's one of the best actors of his generation and the perfect man to play the tormented Bruce Banner.The rest of the cast is great also:Liv Tyler is a great Betty and is really sympathetic with the monster just like in the comics.Tim Roth is a great Blonsky and an even better Abomination,he's just pure badass evil.William Hurt is the best General Ross ever!!!He is literally pulled from the pages of the comic-divided between the duty to capture the rampaging monster and the love for his daughter he really nailed the part.One of the biggest improvements from the previous film is definitely the CGI-The Hulk looks as real as he can be-the skin coloring,textures and shades are all superb bravo to the effects guys they did a fantastic job.Abomination looks great too.His final clash with Hulk is something to talk about for a long time.This is what I call an epic fight.In conclusion I'd like to say that if you are a Hulk fan you must absolutely see this film and I bet you will love it.If you're not a Hulk fan you will enjoy it still.One of the most entertaining action packed movies for years.","

"eva3si0n","29 April 2022","The Incredible Hulk unlucky Hulk dubut on the big movie screen. And although the film became part of the Marvel film franchise, in further films about The Incredible Hulk they almost do not remember. In the first, Edward Norton is not at all suitable for his role. The main anthogonist together failed and appears before the audience literally 20 minutes before the end of the film. The Incredible Hulk is better than the 2003 film, but clearly unsuccessful against the background of other Marvel films of the first phase of the film universe.","

"coolsnake10","3 March 2013","The Incredible Hulk is the best Marvel Movie yet. It does not waste any time. The beginning is powerful, and it doesn't lose energy. The ending is awesome. I would recommend this to every superhero movie fan. I was not disappointed at all. I don't know why everyone is saying that it is not that good. It is so good! Maybe I have a different taste. I think the movie showcases very well how Bruce has problems with his alter ego. Emil Blonsky, the arrogant soldier working for General Ross, is trying to get his hands on the power of the Hulk, while Bruce is trying to get rid of it. It is great story for anyone. See this movie. It completed me.","

"tombstone81","15 June 2008","I suppose any review about a comic book movie must be preceded by a few disclaimers as to the reviewers objectivity. I've been a Hulk fan for more than 30 years, since I started wearing my first Hulk T-shirt at around age 5. I love the big green guy and all the angst and brooding and power and potential carnage he represents...especially knowing that somewhere deep within that poisoned, rippling, veiny interior is a sensitive soul struggling to stay attached to its compassion and humanity. I really liked Ang Lee's 2003 version but I absolutely LOVED this version! The other disclaimer would be that while I am just as fond of ""thinking"" movies like Schindler's List or Flags of our Fathers, I also freely embrace the ""summer blockbuster"" and am more than happy to check my brain at the door and munch away on m lapful of over-priced goodies while things blow up real good in front of me.So with that, you already know my opinion of this newest rendition of The Incredible Hulk. The other reviews who have given this movie an 8-10 have pretty much said it all...so I am not going to elaborate on the awesome destruction scenes, the CGI (which I thought was incredibly well done and realistic), the dialogue or what have you. Quite simply I thought it was perhaps the greatest summer smash movie of all time (in a very elite group amongst T2, Jurassic Park, True Lies and Transformers). Stepping away from my Hulk manlove for a moment, and trying to find some objectivity...I can let readers know that the movie is not without some technical flaws which, if you know in advance and can forgive the filmmakers for, it will likely enhance your enjoyment of the overall product. Some attempts to create humour or ""classic memorable lines"" in summer blockbusters do not always work, and the Hulk has its share of cheese that made me wince. For example, in trying to pay homage to the classic Bill Bixby TV series, Edward Norton's Bruce Banner (who is very weak in his Portuguese) says to a colleague in Brazil...""Don't make me...hungry...you wouldn't like me when I'm hungry!"". Yes, I admit I laughed, but was secretly miffed at the openly cheap attempt to create humour from a classic line...because the part of my brain that I didn't check at the door realized that ""faminto"" and ""zangado"" don't sound enough alike that a person uttering a sentence in a newfound language simply wouldn't make that mistake. There were other examples as well of things that appeared to be created for the cheese-factor that simply would not happen in real life (or likely the comic book for that matter). Things like Bronsky saying to the Hulk ""Is that all you got!?"" when he wasn't yet quite sure that his body could withstand a massive beating and when any other mortal man would be crapping his pants...or as the Abomination speaking fluent English. Why could a man who only recently became the Abomination talk freely in his native tongue, while Banner has been the Hulk for years and finally took everything he had just to grunt ""HULK SMASH!""? And finally, the scene in the cave with the Hulk and Betty Ross. As a movie maker and a seller of comic books...you've just asked me to suspend all disbelief and accept that a giant green monster can withstand a barrage of 50-caliber shells bouncing off his chest like Nerf balls...but then you want me to believe that when he accidentally bumps his head in a cave it's going to hurt so much that he yells out in pain? Again, I understand the motives behind all this stuff...and it is funny, so the humour can be appreciated...it's just that it becomes ""frying pan in the face"" obvious to anybody watching this movie that it tries just a wee bit too hard to be all things to all people. But for 2 hours, it really does succeed in doing that. 9/ 10.","

"on_the_can","23 June 2008","I'll start by saying that I actually liked the 2003 Ang Lee Hulk and was initially disappointed when I heard they were rebooting rather than continuing, but when this movie was over and my friend said, ""that was a zillion times better than the first one,"" I had to agree.With Louis Letterier's The Incredible Hulk, you get a much more down to earth streamlined version of the Hulk everybody wanted the first time around. This is not to say in the least that it's nothing but a CGI fest, all the contrary. The script is smart, not just in its science but in its dialog and handling of the otherworldly subject matter. Letterier, with the help of Edward Norton and company do a remarkable job of convincing you that this could actually happen, even though we all know it couldn't. Characters are strongly developed with well paced tension that eventually builds to a heart stopping climax on the streets of New York. Your movie ticket's gonna buy you heart, humor and loads of thrills and action folks.It's a little disheartening to think that this film's success may easily be hampered by movie goers who still have a bad taste in their mouth from 2003, I wanna address that. This is not a sequel to Ang Lee's 2003 film. This is a complete reboot, they started again from scratch, to make amends and they have succeeded. The movie does a great job of starting over by giving you only snippets in the form of early flashbacks to show how the Hulk was created and what sent Bruce Banner on the run from the law. This sets the movie into action in record time. We catch up with him some years later, he hasn't seen the love of his life, Betty in all that time and she has yet to see or even realize what Bruce's problem really is. Bruce is hiding in Brazil and has been off the grid for about six months, but when a freak accident catches the attention of his pursuers in the U.S. he's on the run again, and eventually forced back home.Ironically, considering a common complaint of the original movie was its inaccuracies to the comic book, this film draws more from the 1970's TV series for its back story and the tone even follows suit somewhat as well. With Bruce on the run we get a lot of action and suspense even when he isn't green and we get our heart from his relationship with Betty. Some comic relief comes from this as well. The movie is much darker in tone than some of the more recent superhero movies and the action gets pretty intense too, they definitely push the boundaries of their PG-13 rating. If you've liked Marvel's other ventures you will probably like this film, but if you're a fan of the original series, the comic and or cartoons, or quite frankly a fan of action adventure movies in general, go see this movie, you WILL like it. I'll say it again, cuz I want Marvel to continue with what could easily be an amazing franchise. Go see this movie!!!","

"Mihnea_aka_Pitbull","9 June 2008","***** This comment might contain spoilers! *****One thing is certain: the thriller parts - mainly the beginning, and all the scenes where Hulk doesn't appear - are well enough done. The Brazilian slums are shot with true visual feeling, and the chase through their maze is definitely the best scene in the movie. Leterrier does have narrative skills and cinematographic style - I really hope he will move away off the comic strips blockbusters and start making true content movies.Also, the characters are well built and developed. Surprisingly, Norton makes a good job out of Bruce Banner, helping us to forget the shapeless blunder from ""The Illusionist"". Very good is also Tim Roth in Blonsky - expressive and compelling. But my favorite was Tim Blake Nelson as Samuel Sterns - he has humor and depth, outlining with true talent the future evolution of The Leader.Unfortunately, the worst side of the movie is Hulk himself - together with the Abomination (a REAL abomination, not just in name!) and with most of the special effects. Hulk is totally false and unconvincing, his movements are stiff and unnatural, and the proportions and texture, preposterous - can you believe that, although a C.G.I., he looks as if made of rubber and papier-mâché? Many of the most interesting features of the C.S. character were lost on the way (for instance, his habit of always talking in the third person, and his despise towards Dr. Banner, his normal alter-ego). The final battle is childishly anticlimactic, with useless quotes of King Kong and devoid of any resourcefulness. Do not expect any bright trick used by Hulk to win the day - there is none. They simply beat each other stupid, until the Abomination falls down - for no reason at all, even more so as it was supposed to be much stronger than Hulk! Personally, I would delete ALL the C.G.I. scenes and re-organize the movie as a paranoid thriller, around the plot of Bruce Banner being chased by the special forces. THAT is the real point here.","

"robertallenandersonjr","13 June 2008","The Incredible Hulk was one of the best movies I have seen this year. It was definitely the best action movie this year. It was by far the best superhero movie and comic movie I have ever seen. The movie is not a big disappointment from all the hype. People might think it was way to over hyped but not me. I wasn't looking to forward to it but wanted to see it. So I decided to go to the midnight showing and it was so worth my money. I want to go see it again already. This is a movie you don't get sick of after seeing once. The action sequences were so loud and well written. They didn't have to much action about just as much as you would see in Iron Man or Spider Man. The story in this movie though was amazing. The story was very well explained. The movie started out write away with them explaining what went wrong and how Edward Norton became the hulk. This one was way better than the first Hulk they made. This movie probably had one of the best battles in any movie at the end when The good Hulk faced off against the bad. They made the Hulk look so good. I think that the visuals and special effects were so amazing. Especially each time they had action scenes. The action scenes went on for a long time and were very fun to watch. The acting was very good as well. Edward Norton did an amazing job playing the hulk. I don't think anyone else could have done a better job then Edward Norton did. Liv Tyler did a good job also playing the hulks girlfriend. She didn't have a ton of screen time but when she did she made the best of it. Everyone else did a great job as well. I don't think their were any flaws at all really. The only one I could possibly think of is that it kind of drug on toward the end. They made it seem like it was going to end and then it went on. The movie was well acted, loud, fun, entertaining, and was great for all ages. I think that even older people can enjoy it and even late teens. The language was not very bad for kids. All and all this was such an amazing movie go see it. It is well worth your money and well worth the hype.","

"KUAlum26","18 June 2008","I was always a little curious as to why,of all the directors in the world,the producers of the 2003 big screen treatment of the Hulk chose Ang Lee. Sure enough,after seeing that version in the theater,while I wasn't entirely turned-off by that version,I came away wondering why what should've been a fun,rip-roaring adventure with everyone's favorite green,muscle-bound beastie formed from gamma rays and brought on by anger/adrenaline was,instead,something of a sort of florid,artsy and visceral film that only 3/4 of the way through remembered that it was a comic book character it was trying to cover and then tried to make up for it.This version didn't leave me feeling that way at all.I know much less about Louis Letterier,except that he's a relatively new director whose previous efforts were basically adrenaline-packed action films(The Transporter series,I think),but with that knowledge,I know he's perfect for this.Picking up from Dr.Bruce Banner's retreat in hiding in South America--specifically,Brazil--after the horrific gamma accident,the erstwhile quiet and unassuming scientist(Edward Norton,maybe a little too good for this type of role,but he does it NO disservice whatsoever)tries in vain to quietly live an existence of meditation and finding a cure for his situation,but that won't last(or else there's no movie). From there,it becomes a transcontinental pursuit between and among Banner,General Thunderbolt Ross(William Hurt,separated at birth from Ted Levine here),Bruce's lost love Betty Ross(Liv Tyler,soothing the savage beast)and the mysterious ""Mr.Blue"" that Bruce is trying to work a ""cure"" with. Into the mix is ""Super Soldier"" Emil Blonsky(Tim Roth,who's never met a nefarious role he doesn't like,it seems),a fierce fighter whose interest in the Hulk threatens to turn him into something just as or more dangerous. Come to think of it,this movie could(accent COULD)be considered a sequel to the first version,since its line of events doesn't vary or completely contradict the Ang Lee version. But otherwise,this is more treated as a ""do-over"" and that's just fine by me. This treatment seems more accurate.The summary line basically comes from the fact that it's truly tough to translate this creature or action accurately without either A)sacrificing character in favor of CGI and ear-splitting boom or B)becoming so entranced in the whos and whys that the appeal of the show gets diluted. I,were I the director,would err on the side of the former(which this show sorta does),since that's probably what most audiences will go for. The screenplay and plot are neither that bad or that good. And that's just fine so long as it serves the Dr.Bruce Banner/Incredible Hulk in the way those who've enjoyed the comics and/or TV show are acquainted. This film achieves that aim amicably.","

"dunmore_ego","5 July 2008","Don't make him hungry! You wouldn't like him when he's hungry Bill Bixby's infamous caveat, once again comically bastardized; in Ang Lee's HULK (2003), Eric Bana delivered it in Spanish at movie's end; now in 2008, Edward Norton delivering pidgin Portuguese - badly.Neither a sequel nor an origin tale, THE INCREDIBLE HULK is an adrenalized shot to the sternum  if it doesn't knock you black and blue, it will at least slap you and call you Susan.The intro sequence reveals the origin back-story, allowing movie to hit the ground running, with skinny Edward Norton as Bruce Banner hiding out in an old-world Brazilian village, text on screen, ""Days without incident: 158."" Our first impulse is ""Wha-?"" This is Edward Norton after all, of renowned Thespian fame; maybe a tad overqualified to deliver lines like, ""Hulk smash!""? Then  it hits: it's EDWARD NORTON, no stranger to Dual Personality  from his breakout schizoid role opposite Richard Gere in PRIMAL FEAR (1996), Norton delivers ""second personality"" like second nature.In Brazil, Banner works in a bottling factory, performing body control exercises with a meditation guru who thrills in bitchslapping him incessantly; monitors his heart rate via a wrist readout and, unlike the rest of theworld, tries NOT to ""go green,"" awaiting an antidote to his Hulk genes from an online mystery man in America named Mr. Blue, before he dares return home. (Banner's code name... Mr. Green. We didn't see THAT coming.) And running gags about stretchy pants aboundBut General Ross (William Hurt) wants Banner's genes to utilize as military weaponry, so single-minded that he would risk his own daughter's life to attain that power. Typical pathological military jug head  nothing we haven't seen in the real world. There's crazy. Then there's Army Crazy. Ross enlists the aid of hard army grunt, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), injected with a super-soldier serum (wink to Captain America fanboys) to take on the Hulk mano-a-mano and capture him for lab experiments which probably include examining the magical material in his pants.The Hulk's first appearance is well-staged, in glimpses and silhouettes. When we see Hulk in full battle daylight, it is astounding! Not just due to the effects team (Gentle Giant Studios, among many) melding him with ""reality,"" but because of the innovative motion-capture technology of Giant Studios. When the Hulk and the soon-to-be-birthed Abomination move, they are smoothly human; walking upright casually, interacting with debris, machinery, people, water rivulets cascading off flexing muscles and though his name reflects the 1962 Marvel Comics creation, no more is Hulk a bulky blob, but a svelte man-machine with a sexy v-shape. I especially like the way these creatures run full tilt, with the desperate lean and violent arm-swing of slim sprinters.There are innumerable canonical nods and winks: Stan Lee as an unwary office guy who drinks a soda tainted with Hulk blood; Bill Bixby in a TV snippet from COURTSHIP OF EDDIE'S FATHER; the *Lonely Man* theme from THE HULK TV series, where Bixby walks the lonely highway in snazzy bell-bottoms that will be shredded by the next episode; a cameo by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) to synergize the Avenger Initiative; and  not least, Lou Ferrigno! When Banner gets back to the U.S. he looks up his old girl, the daughter of General Ross, Betty (Liv Tyler), who, like every woman whose love-of-her-life is on the lam, is time-serving with another guy. Of course, the part-time boyfriend is a complete dork who looks like Casey Kasem in a vest. (It's never a David Lee Roth circa 1980 Van Halen.) When Betty accidentally encounters tragic Bruce, she's all over him like a thousand-dollar hooker. If only all women were so devotional as to curl around you so urgently and intimately after years of separation. That's why they call these things ""fantasy."" Betty and Bruce seek out Mr. Blue (Tim Blake Nelson), who has been hoarding Hulk blood samples like geekboys hoarding back issues. Mr. Blue doesn't really help Bruce, but he helps the plot, when Emil Blonsky, insatiable for monstrous power, forces Blue to inject him with Hulk blood; apparently, mixing super-soldier serum and Hulk blood creates a big vomit-colored, bone-splintering monstrosity called The Abomination which precipitates the TRANSFORMER moment: that point in any film where you realize everything on screen is computer-generated and that this eye-candy battle between two big things might as well be a video game  and you're sitting here watching it even though you're over 30.Still, the action surprisingly contains heart. Hulk becomes Hero. No matter the many incarnations that portray Hulk as brainless or fogged with gamma-amnesia, this Hulk retains a sizeable chunk of Banner-brain, and his fierce compassion bleeds right offa the emerald giant's computer blips. We sense that Hulk's most compelling battle is not with big things that go boom, but with himself. And as good as Hulk's battles are, I don't think many of us over 30 would complain had we been given more of the great Ed Norton doing introspective and sullen.End frames set up the Avenger Initiative with Stark  it is no secret Marvel are cross-pollinating their cameos; hope springs eternal that IRON MAN and THE INCREDIBLE HULK presage a spate of quality Marvel offerings, and that the slated 2011 release of FIRST AVENGER: CAPTAIN America won't be as super-mundane as the 1979 TV series, with Reb Brown gadding about in a foamy muscle suit and plastic bike. As a Cap fan, that debacle made me very angry.Don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.","

"gerbinator2009","14 June 2008","Ironman was by far my favorite movie of the summer. I have not seen the other Hulk movie of 2003 so I really didn't know what to expect. The Incredible Hulk was just as good as Ironman, but in very different ways. I liked Ironman because of the clever mix of humor, action, and peril, however there wasn't much deep emotion or character development. The Incredible Hulk substitutes the humor for emotion, thus resulting in a great movie. Great movie, lots of action, and a great performance by norton.One more thing, I'm tired of the bitching about the CGI. I don't think there's ever been a movie with CGI where someone didn't complain about it. And the only reason everyone is complaining about the CGI of this movie is because everything is so perfect.","

"jcallows","5 November 2008","I loved the way this film paid tribute to the 70s classic. A movie about the Hulk should have some references to Bill Bixby's Hulk and this film had them. It was great to hear some of that music again, see Banner do the lonely walk and see him being given radiation in the way that was done to Bixby. We all loved the 70s version, so why stray too far away from it? The filmmakers had the good taste in deciding not to.With the tone set to more like the 70s show and less like Ang Lee's version, this film was instantly engaging. And along with an interesting story, gripping action and great special effects, this film was thoroughly entertaining. I also liked that it explained how the Hulk has always been able to keep his pants on. I'm not sure if it was explained in the comic books or anywhere else, but this was a nice touch.Edward Norton was an excellent choice to play Banner. No one could be more opposite to the Hulk. (I suppose the Jekyll/Hyde character he played in Primal Fear prepared him for this.) And Liv Tyler was fine. But as much as I like William Hurt, he didn't seem to have much energy. Perhaps it was the script, but he just seemed detached.The CGI effects have come a long way since Ang Lee's Hulk. When I heard they were still going to use CGI for the Hulk in this version, I had my reservations. While it can render reptiles and all sorts of creatures fairly well, computers have always had trouble making humans or human-like creatures look real. But it seems they have come pretty close for this film.One thing I would have like to have seen kept in this film from the 70s version was Banner's reason for getting the radiation-- so that he could become stronger to protect his loved ones. Here, this film went with the comic books' version-- to become a super soldier for the military. I liked the 70s version. It just seemed to add more empathy to Banner's character, and it was just plain more romantic.Well, all in all a great film, and I'm looking forward to the next.","

"Angelus2","16 July 2009","I'm a comic-book nerd...(Just in case you wanna label me).And this is probably the second greatest Comic book movie ever made; first being 'Batman Begins'. And the third if your wondering is Iron-Man. The reason why this movie is so high up on my list, is because it concentrates on the origin story but at the same time keeps going....(If you understand what I'm babbling on about).The story is simple. Bruce Banner is a scientist, whom when angered turns into the 'Incredible Hulk'; a creature of pure rage, and so the American Government look to harness this creature for their own benefit. Banner realising the sheer magnitude of this situation, goes on the run.Ang Lee's version was disappointing with the 'Steroid-like-induced dogs'...But it wasn't that bad...(But it was bad).This movie has a almost spine-tingling music that runs through it, from the television series. With 'real' actors, not models who look like comic book characters...I have new found respect for Edward Norton. He just fits the role of Banner brilliantly, Liv Tyler is sweet as Betty; while Tim Roth and William Hurt are great villains.But the greatest asset of this comic book movie is the Hulk. He is visually stunning and much more menacing than Lee's attempt. The build up to Banner's change is handled magnificently as we, the audience feel Banners anger and rage as they 'beat him up', 'hurt his lover'...And then Hulk arrives....And the build up to the arrival of Abomination is beautifully executed, its definitely well-worth the wait...Bringing two of Marvel's most monstrous creations to duel it out...His look is also terrifying to say the least when you catch the first glimpse of him on the big screen...But the greatest aspect of this Comic Book Movie is the end fight...The greatest comic book fight, also considering that its all CGI...I love how Hulk break out of the ground and gets ready breaking a cop car and creating 'Boxing gloves', LOL.... And he say's the line that we've been waiting for 'HULK SMASH!!'. Simply one word to describe this monster of a movie...Incredible.","

"bobsgrock","21 June 2008","After seeing Iron Man and really enjoying it, I was a little apprehensive to see another Hulk after the disaster from 2003 otherwise known as Ang Lee's Hulk. This one has better acting, a faster pace, and really good special effects that fit perfectly. Edward Norton is very good, again, as the famed scientist Bruce Banner, who gets mean and green when he gets angry. Liv Tyler is also very good as the damsel in distress, Betty Ross. I thought their scenes together were just as good if not better than the ones between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst in the first two Spider-Man movies. As for the action sequences, they go on a tad too long for my taste, but they look great and are not done over the top. Hulk really looks realistic, as does the Abomination. And, of course, as is being advertised, the ending leaves fans wanting more and salivating for a movie about The Avengers. After the great success of Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, I can honestly say I am ready to join them.","

"TheHande","14 June 2008","The Incredible Hulk is a dumbed down version of the Hulk character and story and simply pales to the Ang Lee movie not only in casting, performances, seriousness and writing but generally by being just another run-of-the-mill action movie. Having said that, the movie is actually rather entertaining.The first third of the movie is probably the best and even though it is a very distant nod to how the first movie ended I'm happy that Banner's escape to South America was referenced at least a little bit. The continuous references to the comics and ultimately the future Avengers Film, as well as moments of comic relief keep the movie fresh and going but it's hard to look at the film as anything more than a big budget blow out to get Hulk fighting another monster.My problem with this film is the same as with Iron Man, the film deteriorates into a big over-blown CGI battle rather than trying to actually tell a good story. Unlike in Iron Man, this movie doesn't even have a secondary plot theme to keep it afloat which only manages to enhance it's rather meaningless existence.Still, this is a fun action movie and I'm sure the sequel might actually be just as good. Here's hoping that the Hulk's next big screen appearance will have a little more weight to it.","

"Siloty","14 July 2008","i really wanted to see this movie because i was disappointed with the first Hulk movie. and i feel safe to say that this movie deserves a 10 out of 10.Edward Norton plays Bruce Banner, a choice i did not see coming. i reckon he did a really good job acting his character. Liv Tyler was pretty decent as well and Tim Roth who played Emil Blonsky was good.i liked it how Bruce was in hiding for a long time and actually learnt ways to be able to keep himself relaxed so he wouldn't turn in Hulk.people say that the last i think bout 30-40 mins was a let down because it was just silly that The Abomination was destroying the city and that The Incredible Hulk had to fight and stop him. but i really liked the level of action that was in this movie.Of course Stan Lee has a cameo in this movie like he has done with the movies based off his characters but you also have a cameo of Lou Ferrigno...who is known to have started portraying the Hulk in the 70s TV series, he also does the voice of Hulk in this.good action, good acting, oh and you don't have to wait over an hour before you see The Incredible Hulk.","

"svetlastoyanova","18 June 2008","This movie is incredible. I was a fan to the comics and the animated series first, but that thing transferred onto the big screen is absolutely amazing.Far better than the first time around,anyway. I have never thought that Edward Norton would be perfect for that role, but he is.Bruce Banner is just a young idealistic scientist in love with the general's daughter. He is so shy and polite and really unnoticeable, if you don't look for him you wouldn't even know he is there. Those big blue eyes and charming smile are absolutely irresistible until... he gets angry. Then there is mayhem- he is enormous, he is green, he is loud, the angrier he is the stronger he gets, he is incredible, meet Bruce's alter ego-Hulk.They couldn't be more opposite, which makes the whole transformation more unreal, yet believable. They have one thing in common though- Dr Elisabeth Ross. The gorgeous Lyv Tyler is absolutely outstanding. I don't think she needs to try very hard for that performance, her eyes just say it all, it comes so natural for her. The relationship between her and Bruce is depicted in such a high school manner; it is so adorable, so innocent. She is his university sweetheart. When his big green secret comes out she is the only one Hulk recognises and listens to. Her wellbeing is his primal instinct. In the final fight you could see Bruce creeping his way into Hulk's head, the fight has turned pointless for him, until Beth's life was in danger again.Tim Roth is spot on the shrewd military mercenary Emil Blonsky. His greed for power and a little biological help from General Ross turns him into a ruthless monster Abomination that only Hulk can manage. The fight between them two is literally epic, the CGI effects are spectacular and the destruction is ultimate.The director Louis Leterrier has done quite a good job giving us all the details on the story of Hulk's creation, yet leaving the unimportant bits out, which keeps the plot neat and easy to follow. There is a fair share of emotional torments and colossal battle sequences, not a minute of boredom. And by the end of it, there is definitely going to be a sequel, I bet Stark Enterprises will sponsor that one too. This movie is a must see this summer. You will enjoy every bit of it.","

"neil-476","12 June 2008","The most useful piece of advice comes first - you don't have to stay until the end of the credits. The bit which you would expect to come after the credits is actually the very last bit before. Along comes the end of the film - and it's an ending which puts a big grin on your face - and then there's this extra bit, which puts an even bigger grin there. And then the titles.This film is great. The Ang Lee movie was a big disappointment but, where that movie disappointed, this one pleases. I think there is probably less of the Hulk himself in this one, but the film itself works much better.It's kind of a sequel - you can talk yourself into believing that it starts where the previous movie leaves off - although it ignores much of the origin in the first movie (and, thankfully, anything to do with Banner's father). But it is much more clearly inspired by the TV series - the opening credits clearly reference the TV series, the notion of Banner being on the run was, of course, a constant of the TV Hulk, the TV theme is quoted in the soundtrack music, there is a reporter called McGee, and Bill Bixby is gently referenced in the early minutes.Most importantly, though, it has something which I call ""heart"". Perhaps it's as simple as this movie ""getting"" the Hulk, where Ang Lee didn't. But right from the off, this film emotionally involves the audience in a way which Lee's film, notwithstanding how touchy-feely the first hour was, never did.Stan cameos (of course), as does Lou Ferrigno, and I was delighted to note that Lou also does the Hulk's voice (I'm not going to reveal what the Hulk actually says).The script is miles better than the script of the Ang Lee film. Edward Norton is an excellent Banner, and William Hurt is a much better General Ross than Sam Elliott was - for one thing, you can understand what he's saying. Tim Roth is good as Blonsky. I felt there wasn't much to choose between Liv Tyler and Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross.I think I preferred this visualisation of the Hulk - it is much more filled with uncontrollable rage. The CGI is mostly fine - a bit dodgy in places (the Abomination doesn't always convince, and there's a rain-soaked scene which would, I think, have been better dry).But I really, really liked this film - more than Iron Man.","

"classicsoncall","15 January 2015","I would never have considered Edward Norton to portray a comic book character like The Hulk, but then again, I couldn't see Ben Affleck as Daredevil or Michael Keaton as Batman, so in that arena I'd be batting triple zeroes. Actually, Norton is Hulk's alter-ego Bruce Banner, but I think you get my point.I used to watch The Incredible Hulk TV show of the late Seventies with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, so it was cool to see the muscular body builder portray a security guard, just like he did in the Ang Lee Hulk of 2003. The same with iconic Marvel comic book legend Stan Lee, opening the fridge and dropping that bottle of Pingo Doce soda. That would have been the tainted bottle from the Brazilian assembly line, but otherwise that whole business with Banner's blood was a maguffin, and probably could have been played for more noteworthy effect.In the action department, 'HULK SMASH' acquired powerful resonance in this one. The big green guy had a field day on the campus of Culver University, and that battle with The Abomination (Tim Roth) was an all out blast. The CGI for those sequences was stand-out and creative as well, like when Hulk tore a military vehicle in half and used them as boxing gloves. But the scene that really grabbed me was when Dr. Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) tried the 'cure' on Banner and you had the midway transformation between man and beast. Very well done.So all in all, a pretty cool action flick with a neat set up for the Avengers movie when Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) meets up with General Ross (William Hurt) in the final scene. The Marvel folks have a unique way of tying their characters together to leave you clamoring for more.","

"Beta_Gallinger","2 July 2008","It was five years ago this month I went to see Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" in the theatre, and like many others, I was not too impressed. I last gave it a try on the small screen last year, and it certainly didn't improve. In fact, I probably noticed more flaws in it than before. However, when I learned that this second adaptation of the ""Incredible Hulk"" comic book series was coming, featuring a different cast and director, it was a film I intended to watch. Before I went to see it on the silver screen today, I knew it seemed to be widely considered superior to the 2003 film, so I was expecting it to be, and it was, even though it's not one of my favourite comic book movies.Bruce Banner is now a fugitive from the U.S. Military in Brazil, and has managed not to turn into the Hulk for quite a while. He currently works in a bottling factory, and is learning anger management techniques. He also has conversations on the Internet with someone he knows as ""Mr. Blue"", discussing a possible cure for Bruce's condition. Unfortunately for Bruce, the military manages to track him down, and while they are after him, he is attacked by fellow factory employees, causing him to finally turn into the Hulk again! So, the military doesn't catch him this time, but he is once again on the run from them! He finds himself in Guatemala the next day, and soon makes his way back to the United States, where he meets his former girlfriend, Betty Ross, the daughter of General Ross. From here, his conflict with the military continues, and more trouble arises when another powerful giant green creature appears, The Abomination! Things that sunk Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" include bad acting, some laughable lines in the script, Talbot being a fairly annoying character, and silly multiple scene framing. Fortunately, I didn't notice any of these things in this second attempt to bring The Incredible Hulk to the big screen. The acting isn't really anything to rave about, but at least it's better than before. The script may be a tad weak at times, but at least there are no lines as low as what Betty says to Bruce after he survives gamma radiation in the first film. Aside from that, we don't have any characters as annoying as Talbot, and there's none of the multiple scene framing. 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk"" is also more exciting. I had trouble staying into it for a while, but eventually, the action had me in fairly consistent suspense for probably most of the rest of the film, starting with the battle between the Hulk and the military on the university campus. To add to the entertainment, there's also a bit of humour in this film, such as the crazy taxi driver. Some of the fight sequences may be a bit overlong, but I don't think any of them have anything on the tedious sequence with the Hulk fighting mutated dogs in the 2003 film.With all its merits, this comic book movie is not the greatest one to reach the silver screen since the '90s (there have been lots of those), but it certainly does show a vast improvement after the first ""Hulk"" movie adaptation, and is definitely superior to certain other comic book movies of the decade, such as the Razzie Award-winning ""Catwoman"". Like Ang Lee's 2003 film, this one is dark, which some would like and some wouldn't, but that doesn't really have anything to do with the quality of the film. Unlike its predecessor, this 2008 version of ""The Incredible Hulk"" is actually a fairly decent dark film, and if you're a fan of these comic book movies and were displeased by the first Hulk movie adaptation (like many others were, myself included), well, that's no reason to avoid this second one.","

"sanddragon939","2 May 2009","In the 1960's, a genius named Stan Lee, created for a company named Marvel Comics, an entire stable of characters who were unique and exuded originality in many aspects, including their characterization, their abilities and the style of storytelling of their adventures. Each and every one of his creations was in some way the a brand new innovation. Spiderman, the Fantastic Four, the X-men, Iron Man, Daredevil, Thor and of course, the Hulk. Owing to the worldwide success of the first Spider-Man film in 2002, Marvel has since sought to recreate all of Stan Lee's characters for the big screen and reinvent and reinterpret them for modern audiences. Their most recent and ambitious attempt at this has been with the creation of their own studios, Marvel Studios which will produce several films featuring various Marvel characters, set in a common continuity, so that the characters may interact in a future crossover film. The Incredible Hulk is the second film to be released as part of this ambitious project and following on the heels of the highly successful Iron Man, it has certainly done pretty well commercially and even critically, though probably not as much as its producers would have liked. Though the Incredible Hulk is a reboot of the short-lived Hulk movie franchise (which began and ended with the 2003 Hulk film), it does not retread the plot of the previous film by retelling the characters tragic origin story...rather it has the unique quality of reinventing the character and reintroducing him to the audiences while at the same time taking the character forward and presenting new material to viewers who have seen the previous film. The story revolves around Bruce Banner, who has been living with the curse of the gamma-charged monster called the Hulk for five years now. Banner, who is on the run from the US Military, led by General Ross, seeks a cure from his abnormal condition, with the help of his ex-girlfriend and his arch-Nemesis's daughter, Betty Ross. General Ross however is determined to capture the Green Goliath and to this end empowers a Special Forces veteran named Blonsky with the Super Soldier serum. However, Blonsky's lust for power results in his transformation into the all-powerful Abomination, whose rampage through the streets of New York City can only be stopped by the Hulk! It is this no holds barred fight scene which is truly the climatic moment of this film. Edward Norton does a brilliant job portraying Bruce Banner as the scientist and fugitive tormented by his brutal alter ego, while Liz Tyler plays the part of the faithful girlfriend and companion to perfection. Ultimately, this film has given the Hulk the momentum to make a giant leap towards future success...it remains to be seen if the producers enable him to actually make that leap...","

"cultfilmfan","23 June 2008","The Incredible Hulk is a live action film version based upon the Marvel comic book's famous superhero who has become famous through both television and even a feature film from five years ago. I have seen small parts of the live action Hulk television series from the 70's, but only small parts and never an entire episode. Also growing up I did read some graphic novels, but I was never really into the many superhero comics that existed, so before going into this movie I only knew a little bit about the Hulk from what I have seen of the television shows and the trailers for the two films. I would guess that the more knowledge you have about the history of Bruce Banner and his alter ago the Hulk, the better off you are enjoying this movie. Unlike some of the other superhero films we have seen lately, this version does not really give us as much of a back story of the Hulk, or Bruce Banner. The film takes place after all this has happened and how Bruce became the Hulk, we learn in flashback scenes and just through conversations that the characters have with each other. Still, I did not find the film hard to follow because of this and it still made it easy enough to follow for someone like myself who was never really been into the comics, television shows, or other sources of media that the Hulk has been in. Reviewing a film like The Incredible Hulk, or even Iron Man, or some of the other action superhero movies lately, is not quite as fun, or always that easy to write about compared to an art film such as Mister Lonely, which was the last film I saw in theatres. I find it easier to write more about experimental, or artistic films, or even films with a lot of in depth characters or happenings going on. I personally like to analyze the films and characters in the movies that I 'am watching and I 'am not trying to sound biased, but usually in a film of this kind, you do not have a whole lot of character study, intelligent dialogue or thought provoking material that will stay with you long after the film is over. However, I can say that much like the other kind of films I have reviewed this summer (I'm talking more about the Hollywood releases that mostly have been about superheroes and have big budgets and so on) The Incredible Hulk is not anything groundbreaking or new and probably not even particularly needed since we just had a Hulk film a couple of years ago and we are getting bombarded with superhero films, but on the positive side this movie has an excellent pace and will have enough action and enough going on to please even the most particular film viewer. Like many of these type of films I see simply because my theatre doesn't usually get the artsy or intelligent films, I liked this film simply because of the entertainment factor and that is all I can really go by for my recommendation. And by recommending it, I'm given it a positive rating, but would much rather persuade people to see something like Mister Lonely if it is playing in your area, or even the vastly underrated film Sex And The City, which is a Hollywood film, but unlike the Hulk it is clever, has well developed characters and leaves you more to be satisfied with intellectually than two hours of mediocre special effects and action scenes that are really nothing new. If you are a big fan of Marvel comics and the Hulk then this film will be for you and for those who live in a city like mine where you are stuck with films like this, you could do worse than seeing this film because it is entertaining and even though it's strictly by the books it is entertainment and I guess that is what people want to see when they go to the theatre, so this may be right for you. As for me I liked it, but I don't think it will be something I'll see again, or remember even a couple of months from now when I have seen more and hopefully better films.","

"hitchcockthelegend","20 November 2008","Scouring the earth looking for a cure to his gamma ray poisoning, Bruce Banner is in Brazil when the army, who want to harness the monster within him as a weapon, locate him. General Ross and the power hungry Emil Blonsky will stop at nothing to capture Banner and his significant other angry half, but Banner's true love, Betty Ross, and the mysterious Mr Blue, are allies hoping to cure Bruce of his ills, but is it all in vain?Those who hated Ang Lee's thoughtful and emotionally driven version of Hulk in 2003 will find this a far more rewarding experience, a mere 20 minutes in and the green one arrives to raise the pulses and set comic book enthusiasts hearts a racing. Not skimping on action or in fact an emotional core, the makers here have managed to blend both the fundamental aspects of the duality being and almost pulled off a great movie, but it's still some way short of being a comic book adapted classic. The pluses do however far outweigh the minuses, this Hulk incarnation is one you can take the kids to see and they can't possibly be bored, the introduction of the wonderfully named The Abomination as a Hulk nemesis ensures the audience is eagerly awaiting the big smack down, thankfully when it arrives it's thrilling, totally daft and entirely within the spirit of the Hulk origins. Major kudos to Tim Roth who as Blonsky, soon to be the monstrous looking Abomination, delivers a delicious line in ego driven badness, and with a fact of movie life being that a film of this type is only as good as its villain, Roth steps in to keep the film above ropey waters.Annoyingly, considering the cast list here, the film is not without problems. Edward Norton is clearly one of the best actors of the modern age, and his restrained showing here as Banner is certainly not at all bad, it's just an odd casting choice to me, almost as if this role is far too beneath him, watching his turn was like an itch I just couldn't scratch. Liv Tyler as Betty Ross steps into the slender shoes vacated by Jennifer Connelly in Lee's 2003 version, it may be unfair to compare the two, but where Connelly had much emotional heart in her portrayal, Tyler has nothing, and her emotional play off with Norton in the crucial scenes just lacks the spark needed to make it work to the full. William Hurt works well enough as General Ross, following on from his bad boy turns in A History Of Violence and Mr Brooks, Hurt is finding something of a working resurgence in devilment characters, while Tim Blake Nelson perfectly dons the caricature hat of scientist on the edge, Dr. Samuel Sterns.The CGI of Hulk has vastly improved, still a borderline problem, it just may well be that we all should accept that Hulk as a character is never going to be a CGI dream? With that in mind it is perhaps churlish to do down Incredible Hulk based on its entertainment value? Which is certainly very high. Yet it's notable that Edward Norton offers nothing by way of a commentary on the DVD package of the film, Tim Roth joining director Louis Leterrier for the gag track only fuels the fire that apparently leading man and director were well at odds about the direction the film was taking. So is Incredible Hulk recommended to the average thrill seeking movie lover? Most assuredly yes. Is Incredible Hulk a worthwhile comic book adaptation? Well sort of: Better than Daredevil and Darkman, but well short of Spidey and The Bat. At times looking like a cheap knock off of Peter Jackson's King Kong, Incredible Hulk has a willingness to entertain, and maybe we all should just focus on that and enjoy the ride? 7/10","

"shiftyeyeddog","13 June 2008","The new Hulk is not quite as drastically different from the previous one as they'd have you believe in terms of being action-packed. The Hulk still shows up rather sparingly for the first 3/4 of the movie, then finally takes center stage for the extended climactic finale. Not that I think it should be any different - I just don't think this one piles on the action much more than the last, as has been said. That being said, this film is a huge improvement over the mess that was the last Hulk film. From the acting to the writing to the effects, this blows away Ang Lee's version. The CG is not bad, and I'm sure it's probably the best possible at this time, but still looks very artificial, especially faces and when interacting with real characters. But such is the nature of movies - suspension of disbelief. The movie is pretty enjoyable, though, and chalks up another success for Marvel. If only the film rights to other characters like X-Men and Spider-Man would revert back to them so they can do them properly. Regarding the cameos: I have no problem with other Marvel characters showing up in cameos in these films - why shouldn't they all exist in the same universe? But I'm getting a little tired of the rest of these wink-wink cameos - this time we get Stan Lee AGAIN (seriously, in one movie it was funny, after that it's just annoying) and TV Hulk Lou Ferrigno. Stunt casting like that really takes you out of the story, and you have to listen to everyone in the theater turn to their friend or kid and say ""hey! that's _______!""","

"aesgaard41","11 September 2013","Despite the negative reviews of the first movie, I'm surprised that Hollywood gave the Hulk another chance; however, instead of picking up as a sequel, Hulk gets a reboot with a new back story retold in a flashback... or not. ""Incredible Hulk"" is meant to be a reboot, but it can be felt as a sequel. Banner's dream can be construed as revised imagery, and Ross's memories can be behind the scenes details of the first movie. There are no real contradictions that this movie is anything but a sequel; Betty is still a colleague, and Bruce is still in South America. The only problem I have is the cast. Edward Norton plays Banner much like Bana, and Liv Tyler and William Hurt replace Jennifer Connelly and Sam Elliot who I much preferred in the roles. Tim Roth, however, steals all his scenes as the power-hungry Emil Blonsky more obsessed with being like Banner than being a real soldier. That's kind of where it falls apart for me; you'd think Ross would hire more qualified men with less than shaky psyche evaluations. At some point, you'd think Blonsky would realize why Banner wants to get rid of this thing. One of the highlights is Tim Blake Nelson as the puckish and affable scientist who will become the future Leader. Unfortunately, Ty Burrell gets limited scenes as Doc Samson and is pretty much only an observer to the life Tyler's Betty Ross and her complicated relationship with her father. The plot and script, however, are excellent, the action is impressive and the brief jokes and ""Easter eggs"" along the way to the ""Avengers"" movie are enjoyable. What the movie lacks from the strong cast of the first movie, it actually makes up for a much tighter and lighter story, even going as far as embracing the scenery and imagery of the TV Hulk series. At times, Norton even looks like Bill Bixby. What I like even more is that the CGI is a bit better that we get slow tertiary shots of the Hulk before being blasted with him in entirety, eventually exploding toward a full-on animated climactic battle between the Hulk and Roth's Abomination (now a bit more reptilian and orange) on the streets and rooftops of Harlem. An earlier showdown between the Hulk and the Army deploying high-tech weapons is one of the top scenes in the movie. The only thing that would have made this movie even better than it already is would have been including Dean Cain as Superman to scrap with the Hulk, because, let's face it, the next top thing for comic book movies should be an inter-company crossover.","

"alindsayal","23 December 2021","Next on the list of MCU films is the forgotten film in the franchise The Incredible Hulk and I re-watched it last night and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Bruce Banner travel the world looking for a cure for his Hulk problem while the US army hunt him down and try and gain his power.Main Character
It is easy to forget that Edward Norton was the original Bruce Banner in the MCU and he is really good in this film. I just really like the small frame of Norton as Banner compared to the huge Hulk and the film does a great job of showing that and it feels really intense when he transitions into The Hulk. He is a character that is easy to root for and he delivers in a role that it is a bit of a shame we never got to see him in again.Supporting Characters
William Hurt plays General Ross and he is great, he is a really good antagonist for the film and it is like he was born to play the role of a US Army General and he knocks it out of the park here and is a nice addition. Tim Roth plays Emil Blonsky and again I think he is a very interesting antagonist, I just really like how even though he is basically a normal army guy he isn't intimidated by The Hulk and wants to go one on one with him and it adds a fascinating dynamic. Liv Tyler plays Betty Ross and I thought she and Norton had a really good dynamic, she is a pretty strong love interest and it felt pretty natural and there are some really good moments between the two of them.Story
The story is good, the best thing it does is avoids the origin story and starts the film in a really interesting place with Banner already on the run from the government and it is interesting seeing him trying to find this cure for the Hulk even though you pretty much know where it is going to go. For me though it is the films final act where it falls down, there is a big CGI battle and it is nowhere near as good as the rest of the film and I really wish the final battle had gone in a different direction then it did. Also the film seems to be confused about how Banner changes into The Hulk and it really bugs me in this film as it feels like just an excuse for some comedic moments.Script
The script is good in fact I think it is pretty good indeed. The drama feels real and very personal for Banner and the relationships between characters are really well handled and natural feeling. The humour mostly works, I have the issues above but it isn't enough for me to take points off of the overall rating.Style
The style is decent, the pacing is really good for the film and keeps it moving at a brisk pace and keeping you interesting throughout, also when Hulk is wrecking army guys that is really cool. But this film is held back a bit by its age as the CGI doesn't look very good and is clearly dated. Whereas Iron Man still looks great this film doesn't hold up so well.Overall
Overall, despite the fact it is mostly forgotten this is a great film with plenty of upside. If you are watching the Marvel films then don't miss this one out as it is certainly worth the time of day.Rating - 8/10.","

"Boba_Fett1138","13 July 2008","Seems like I'm one of the very few who actually liked Ang Lee's ""Hulk"". It was a movie that failed to attract and please the majority of people. Still they obviously thought there was lots of potential with the Hulk character for further movies and therefore 5 years later this movie got released, which is not a sequel to Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" and instead is a re-telling and re-establishment of the Hulk character. It ignores the facts from the first movie and doesn't very much concentrate on the Hulk origins or emotional aspect of Bruce Banner but it's more a movie that comes straight to the point and cuts to the chase immediately, so to speak. ""The Incredible Hulk"" is bigger, has more action and far more potential to please the mainstream crowd. It also of course obviously has as a result that the movie is rather simple.Not only the director is different this time (Louis Leterrier) but also the cast is. Edward Norton seems like an unlikely choice for such a big mainstream blockbuster but he of course is more than a capable actor and therefore also pulls off just fine. Still I liked Eric Bana's more humane and emotional performance of Bruce Banner in ""Hulk"", despite the fact that I think Edward Norton is a better actor. But to be honest I liked every actor and performance from ""Hulk"" better than was the case with this movie. Liv Tyler replaced Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross and William Hurt replaced Sam Elliott as general Ross. Completely new characters are being played by Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky and Tim Blake Nelson as Samuel Sterns, who are again, two actors who don't seem like very likely choices for such a big summer blockbuster but work out just fine for the movie. Of course especially Tim Roth, as the movie its main villain. Still funny though that a supposedly Russian character speaks with such a fat British accent. It was good though to see him in a big production again. He had been out of the picture for too long.Of course this is no movie that pays particularly much attention to its story. Once you start over-analyzing it you'll find plenty of plot-holes and the movie leaves more questions then answers. But of course you shouldn't think too much about this though, for ""The Incredible Hulk"" is just not this kind of movie. It's a movie that is supposed to bring entertainment and at this it really does not fail.This is obviously a movie that cost some serious money to make. With its budget around $150,000,000, this is a real big summer blockbuster. The money can mostly be seen back on screen with some big action sequences. I actually have to admit that some of the action is the best I've seen in recent years. It's of course also a movie that relies heavily on its CGI, for its Hulk character mostly. The special effects are simply great though so it shouldn't really ever 'trouble' you that this is a CGI heavy movie. This is also due to the directing approach of the movie, that shows the Hulk often more as a mysterious and dark creature who moves around in the shadows. The camera doesn't zoom all the time right into the Hulk or the villainous Abomination. They often instead more walk around in the background and the camera doesn't get a clear focus on them, as if it's 'bigfoot' footage, or the Loch Ness monster. This amateur, shaky, unclear looking style that has become recently popular for movies and is a style that I like very much for movies and also truly works out well for this particular movie.It's a movie that shows that the Hulk and superhero movie genre in particular still has plenty of potential in it. The movie also hints at possible sequels and even for movies in which multiple Marvel comic book heroes are going to team up. I would pay money to see it happen all!Even though I don't think it's the best the genre has to offer, it simply was a movie that I very much enjoyed watching.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","

"Carycomic","15 June 2008","When I first saw the 2003 version, starring Eric Bana, I gave it 3.1 stars out of a possible five (with five=the best).This version gets _all_ five.For starters, we have a condensed origin/montage that's more reminiscent of the 1970's TV series than the 2003 movie. Absolutely no mention, or depiction, of Nick Nolte as the mad geneticist-father of Bruce Banner.Then, there's the series of tie-ins with the recently-released ""IRON MAN"" flick. Equipment bearing the label of ""Stark Industries;"" a cyberspace patch with the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo on it; and an uncredited cameo by RDJ, himself.Last, but not least? We have the angst and poignancy that is a mandatory part of any decent Hulk story. A prime example is the segment where Betty Ross finds out that Bruce is back in the Big Apple. When he discovers that she's moved on with her private life (in the form of psychiatrist Dr. Leonard Samson), he tries to stay away. But, when they accidentally glimpse each other, she pursues him. Picking him up on a rainy stretch of highway in a reunion scene that you'd have to be a ""Star Trek"" Vulcan to sit through with dry eyes.The main villain this time around, though, is Emil Blonsky. Relative English newcomer Tim Roth (well, he's new to me) plays him as a professional covert-operations commando who prides himself on being one of the toughest men in the world. That is; until Bruce ""Hulks out"" on him, down in Brazil. He then becomes obsessed with getting a rematch on equal terms. And, he has very little trouble persuading Gen. ""Thunderbolt"" Ross to arrange just that.As played by William Hurt, Ross is even more of an unsympathetic super-patriot than Sam Elliot's version was. Perhaps, because Hurt might have been drawing on the same sinister streak that made him so frighteningly believable as Kevin Costner's alter-ego in ""MR. BROOKS.""Either way; much as I enjoyed Eric Bana's portrayal of the Hulk, five years ago, Edward Norton's was twice as good. And, if you're wondering if Marvel Studios is already at work on sequel? Take a close look at Mr. Blue's forehead after Blonksy becomes the Abomination.That's all I'm saying...till then. ;-)","

"asaar","15 June 2008","So this movie wasn't THAT bad I guess. It was definitely entertaining, a bit better than Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk. There were many things that really bugged me about this one though. First off it is full of advertisements. They threw in a Norton Anti-Virus ad (maybe provoked by Edward Norton's lead role.) Also, Liv Tyler's character decided to buy a rather expensive looking camera after she sold her diamond studded pendant which did not add to the plot at all. Liv Tyler and Edward Norton also do a pitiful job of acting. The two of them had no chemistry. It was like the director threw them on the set without any previous interaction and said ""Act!"" Despite these harmful casting issues and the unfortunate amount of advertising going on, this was a fun summer movie.","

"TheLittleSongbird","26 January 2012","There may be those who agree with me, and those also who will disagree, but while it is not devoid of flaws I really enjoyed The Incredible Hulk, whereas I was disappointed in 2003's The Hulk, and I'm saying this as someone who loved Ang Lee's other films.If there is one thing that Lee's film succeeds better in, it is the visuals, don't get me wrong they are very stylish here but the ones in the 2003 film were slicker even if The Incredible Hulk is bigger and brasher. This said, the cinematography and editing are great and the locations and lighting look fantastic. The music rouses, the story compels most of the time and the dialogue provokes both in a thoughtful and emotional way.I do think that director Louis Letterier brings a lot of passion into the film, especially with the use of the form of street running called Parkour that he also used in The Transporter. The action sequences are suitably thumping, with efficient choreography and slick editing. The romantic elements are handled in a shrewd manner in alternative to the danger of slowing the film down, and thankfully there is no underdeveloped and convoluted subplot like Lee's film did with Nick Nolte.The first half though in a sense is better than the second. The second half is in no way bad, it's that the first half was very clever and compelling, and although you do identify with the titular character all the time and the finale is earth-shattering the film loses it a bit with the rather clichéd way the villain Blonsky is written and that his motives are not always very clear or as believable as they had potential to be.Casting-wise The Incredible Hulk is excellent. Edward Norton brims with intensity but he is also sympathetic. The Incredible Hulk also succeeds in making a real sense that Banner and the Hulk inhabit the same tortured mind, which made it much more accessible to identify with him, something that Lee's film did not do. William Hurt is appropriately steely as General Ross, Liv Tyler is attractive and the essence of sympathy as Banner's girlfriend and although his character is not as believable Tim Roth does somehow manage to bring some credibility to him.Overall, a very solid film, not perfect but better than the 2003 film by quite some distance. 8/10 Bethany Cox","

"Medacakathareal","2 November 2008","After the atrocious 2003 attempt at the Hulk I was worried when I heard that a reboot was in the making. I had begun to believe that the old Bill Bixby series was about as good a Hulk as we were ever going to get, and quite frankly was pretty content. But, with the DVD release of the Incredible Hulk I'd figure I'd give it a shot, and I was surprised at how good the movie turned out.The Hulk looks a lot better, the CGI has improved quite a bit since 2003, and he seems a darker, more realistic green tone. The film is pretty simple plot wise, the military hunts the Hulk to use him as a weapon while poor Banner is just trying to survive and learn how to control and eventually get rid of, his alter ego. There are a few throw backs to the old series, including the ""sad walking away theme"" and the zooming in on Banner's eyes when he has a ""spike"". There are some pretty awesome battle scenes, including one where a helicopter crashes, the special effects aren't ground breaking but they are still top notch. The only real flaws I found were the New York setting, this is the Marvel Universe, so where is Spider-Man while all this is happening? And I really didn't like the way SHIELD seemed to be okay with the whole super-soldier program, I'm worried that the Avengers will end up taking orders from the deceptive government, that would be a sad day indeed.A few extra points that made the film great:Inclusion of the line ""HULK SMASH"" A cameo by Stan Lee (as he is prone to do) Tony Stark's little cameo Someone almost gets killed with a forklift (MST3K anyone?)And just a whole lot of awesome moments that make the comic book geek in me satisfied... Set aside any skepticism you might still be retaining and see The Incredible Hulk...","

"chera_khalid","2 October 2023","""The Incredible Hulk"" smashes onto the screen with Edward Norton embodying the green rage of Bruce Banner. The acting, particularly Norton's portrayal, adds layers to the tormented scientist on the run. The film editing captures the kinetic energy of Hulk's rampages while also delving into Banner's internal struggles. The strength lies in the film's ability to blend action-packed sequences with moments of introspection, showcasing the human side of the monstrous hero. However, the weakness may be found in the occasional pacing hiccups that interrupt the otherwise thrilling narrative. The music, though not as iconic as other superhero scores, complements the Hulk's destructive ballet. With a 7/10 rating, ""The Incredible Hulk"" stands as a green-hued chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, delivering smashing entertainment with a dash of soul-searching.","

"mjarvis0","2 March 2009","To comment on this movie I will do a comparison between the Eric Bana (EB) version and this the Edward Norton (EN) version. The first thing to say is that what the EN version has demonstrated is that with some screenplays/directors you can tell a story in 2 minutes what some screenplays/directors take half an hour to do. The EN version told us the audience in two minutes how Bruce Banner came to be the Hulk while the EB version took half an hour of valuable film time. Secondly the EN version stuck more or less to the TV series of the Hulk that featured the late Bill Bixby while the EB version went off on some weird tangent bringing in Bruce Banner's father into the equation. I was also particularly touched by the tribute to Bill Bixby that was in the EN version while also giving the great Lou Feringo (He is the TV version of The Incredible Hulk if you didn't know) a speaking part with him exchanging dialogue with his alter ego (David Banner) so to speak. To be fair the Hulk action scenes in the two versions were comparable but the idea of the super soldier in the EN version was easier for me to accept than the Father Son conflict as given to us in the EB version. I also liked the way the EN version once again paid tribute to the Bill Bixby TV series. This was done when Bruce Banner met Betty again. For those of you too young to have see the television series of the Incredible Hulk, the regular feature in that series was Bruce Banner thumbing a lift. So I have given this version of The Incredible Hulk 9 out of Ten and hope to see more!","

"Astralan","17 June 2008","I have to admit, I really don't know why I went to this. In a venue saturated with CGI and somewhat crappy scripts and story lines, this installment over what was released just 5 years ago seems somewhat nonsensical. On top of that, Louis Leterrier has only directed only 2 films in his carer: Danny the Dog (Unleashed) and The Transporter II. Granted, both films merit a smile and a nod for actually being quite good films, however to hand over $150+ (which is incredible seeing at least almost 1/2 the film is done in CGI) seems also a little nonsensical in this case. It just seems to me that these movies are quickly becoming ordinary and harder to watch unless there are some great innovations in them, or at least a solid story line and a good ending.I like Ed Norton in this role though. At times you could see some striking resemblances to Bill Bixby at moments, and his mannerisms are more in tune with the original Bruce Banner character. I'll state right here that I am not going to do cross platform comparisons with all the various Hulk remakes and episodes, sorry. Liv Tyler seems a bit sappy in her role. I think she gets picked because she knows how to squirt those tears when needed, and on demand, and I didn't know what to make of William Hurt as her estranged father. Try as he might, I just can't see him in a ""tough guy"" situation.The CGI is probably what takes this movie into a more plausible realm. In the beginning, you meet Bruce banner, and there is a counter for the important scene changes that tell you how long it's been since his last ""episode"". The director brings in Hulk fairly early, but they leave him in shadows for the most part, only delivering the objects of his rampaging to the audience. This movie really has no start or finish, it is more like we are dropped in as observers into a struggle that aspires to be normal but seems to be a futile objective, and when we finally get Hulk so steamed up to yell the famous ""HULK SMASH"", it comes across climactic, but lacks that which should be sending electricity through your body.And that, for me about sums it up: It just didn't give me a charge. It was OK to watch, actually it was much better than the 2003 remake, but as far as being up there with this year Iron Man *cough* (could be the closest thing to a spoiler I can get to) *cough*, but probably by far not the worst movie we will see this year. The audience was quiet throughout the viewing, which also supports my lack of charge contention. Let us hope that they don't remake this one for at least another 20 years. Maybe by then we will go HOLO!","

"hoernkeem","4 April 2021","The Incredible Hulk (2008, Louis Letterier)
I am going to start by saying I really love this movie. I have always liked the Hulk as a character and I think this film does justice to the character and also to the MCU, still in its infancy in 2008. This movie seems to be widely discredited and not very well regarded although I haven't heard much in the way of valid arguments to that effect. After the success of 'Iron Man' 'The Incredible Hulk is the second film from the MCU and is directed by Louis Letterier who does a very good job here. Edward Norton stars as Bruce Banner and Hulk in a motion capture role. Most notable here is that Norton is the most prominent role in the MCU to be recast as he famously fought with director Letterier over the final edit and chose not to promote the film. Norton was replaced in future MCU projects by Mark Ruffalo who would go on to be the more popular face of the Hulk in this universe. Along with Norton the film stars Liv Tyler, William Hurt and Tim Roth. The only actor to reappear in the MCU following work in 'The Incredible Hulk' was suprisingly Hurt's Gen. Ross. This film is a great introduction to the Hulk and Banner without being an origin story. It contains a good fugitive plotline that pays homage to both the comics as well as 70's television show. It has decent villains rooted in Hulk mythology as well as some pretty hectic action sequences. There is honestly very little here that I don't like. Other than introducing the Hulk there is only minimal expansion of the MCU story as a whole, but that is to be expected as this is still the first act and all these intial films' primary purpose are just character introduction rather than attempting to vault us immediately into the larger interconnected story that is bubbling under the surface.We begin with Banner hiding out in Brazil, always a gorgeous shooting location, a fugitive from the U. S. government. We learn quickly over the credits, if you didn't know already, due to a science experiment gone wrong Banner gets zapped into the green, indestructible monster known as the Hulk. Later it is discovered this was some derivation of a super soldier program which, I think, is a reference to Captain America. Gen. Ross has been hunting Banner for ""stealing"" this prized military tech. Banner has not only been eluding the authorities, but attempting to find a cure for his unique condition to no avail. He has been corresponding with someone in the states known only as Mr. Blue. Ross brings in die hard soldier from the Royal Marines named Emil Blonsky, played by Tim Roth, to help hunt down the Hulk. When he gets a whiff of what the Hulk is not only does he want that power, but he wants the fight of his life. He becomes the main antagonist of the film and the character Hulk must eventually have a showdown with as events ultimately lead Blonsky to turn into the Abomination, a very Hulk like monster bent on mayhem and destruction. If there is a slight negative it is probably Blonsky/Abomination as villain. He is not really a bad villain, but he is just very one dimensional. He just wants a fight and there is little to no motive beyond that which seems a bit simplistic. Banner eventually must return to the states in order to get aid from Mr. Blue. This leads to a showdown with Ross and Blonsky in a great action sequence. We also get Banner reunited with his love Betty Ross. This then leads to the ultimate death match between Hulk and Abomination. Mr. Blue is revealed to be Samuel Sterns who is Hulk villain The Leader in the comics and seems to be heading that way at the end of this film although his character has never been revisited.This is a great second film for the MCU and was saddened that it was the lowest grossing at the box office of the bunch. I think some may have been gun shy after 2003's awful 'The Hulk' film directed by Ang Lee. This film has a stellar cast. It does a wonderful, if slightly simplistic introduction to the character. There are great special effects. The Hulk and Abomination both look incredible! There are tremendous action sequences as well as few good quieter story moments. I loved the homages from a Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno cameo to Hulk Smash and purple stretchy pants and one every so quick moment of the wonderful plaintive melody that always would play at the end of the television show. The portrayal of Hulk as creature is wonderful as he is immensely powerful, but yet with the Banner core he is a very reluctant hero and we can see that in the performance a few times before he ramps up to full Hulk power butt kicking mode. We also get baby steps expansion of the MCU in a post credit scene where Tony Stark shows up to talk about the Avengers with Gen. Ross. I have seen this film probably more times than any other MCU film and I love it every time.Eric's Grade: A-","

"jdkraus","28 June 2008","People told me not to see the 2003 release of ""The Hulk"" and so I didn't see it. I expected the same news for this release, but I was told to see it. Having not seen the '03 version, I anticipated this would be a sequel and I wouldn't like it since I missed the first one. To my surprise though, ""The Incredible Hulk"" was no sequel, rather its own take on the character Bruce Banner and the Hulk.Unlike some other superhero movies that I have seen, this had a plot that I found interesting. Rather than just being about a giant, angry green man who unleashes massive destruction, it's about the real man underneath who wants to change. Such a unique idea shows that the lead actor Edward Norton, who helped wrote the script, is more than just an ordinary thespian.Norton was a great choice for Bruce Banner/The Hulk. He's believable, engaging, and at times funny. Liv Tyler (still beautiful as ever), is another a good addition to the film as Banner's romance. Together, Norton and Tyler made the film even more intriguing. It was also nice to see Tim Roth, who later becomes the Hulk's archenemy in the movie. I've only seen him in a couple of other films, but he always played a decent villain as he does in this.Like with all other superhero movies, there's a lot of CGI. I won't say I was impressed by it like I was with ""King Kong"" or even ""Transformers"", since it's almost in every action flick, but the fight sequence between Hulk and Abomination at the end was quite a feast for the eyes.But there were several things that left me hanging at the end of the film. I'm not going to say what they are, but I found them rather bothersome. Then again, this leaves room for a sequel. I will say though that the last scene in the film has an appearance of Tony Stark from Iron Man. This leaves clear evidence that ""The Avengers"" is underway for the big screen. 8/10","

Edward Norton not being recast as Hulk in the Avengers movies is a huge disgrace and the worst part is, he was willing to do it, but they cast a whole other person instead. SadEdward Norton as Hulk is still my favorite actor to this date to play the big green beast. Not hating on Mark Ruffalo or anything, not at all, but Norton will forever be the best Hulk. Mark Ruffalo could only dream of playing such a iconic Hulk. Amazing acting, beautifully portrayed Hulk, amazing fights. Nice action scenes. Let us not forget the fitting villain.

"ad_upclose","21 June 2008","I always had concerns about how good this movie was gonna be. One thing for sure, it's more entertaining than the first. But it is not a great superhero movie (Iron Man was more rounded). But it's not really fair to compare it with Batman or Iron Man. Hulk is a far less complex character, so it was always going be hard to make a great movie on him. There are some cheesy & unexplained scenes, but not enough to hurt the film too much.However, there is enough in this movie to make it a good 'popcorn' flick. I liked how they did not rveal the Hulk fully till later; showing him through shadows was cool I felt. Norton was convincing as always, & there is some subtle humor here & there. The CGI is really good for the most part of the film, and the final fight was awesome (beats Iron Man's hands down). Abomination was a really cool adversary, & I hope to see more of him (yup a spoiler!).Overall, an entertaining summer flick.","

"blanbrn","14 June 2008","""The Incredible Hulk"" clearly this time around is a much better version than the one that Ang Lee made in 2003. As this time we see a film blended with more comedy, action, and less dramatization. From the start we see Ed Norton looking graceful and well prepared as he fits the role perfect for Bruce Banner the research scientist turned angry Hulk who will hide out in the slums of Brazil. Plus a good theme of character study is shown as Banner must do his own anger management control. Banner himself we see as a conflicted man not wanting the power of the Hulk yet his power is wanted by the service of the army enter Gen. Ross(William Hurt)who plans to harness the Hulk as a weapon in which leads to a showdown that goes across the globe. Memories are brought back by old ""Hulk"" fans as Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee have cameos. All during this action feast the Hulk is a rampaging force that can blast off even the biggest and baddest weapons the military has. Good chemistry is found in the film with his love interest Betty Ross as Liv Tyler does a fine job. Overall a better take on the green giant it's worth a watch if you want to see some roaring action.","

"dantheman0056","23 June 2008","Let me start off by saying that for those of you who liked the Ang Lee version ( the minority) you may not like this. For those of you who didn't this is the movie for you! The Hulk is back in a reboot not connected to the Ang Lee's in anyway. Edward Norton is a great Bruce Banner, but it seems like he could have used a little more dialog and development to make him stand out better. Liv Tyler as Betty Ross was passable but nothing really special. General Thunderbolt Ross and Emil Blonsky were both great in their roles as villains. Although Bruce isn't the Hulk for the majority of this movie the action scenes are very intense and I have to admit I liked them better than Iron Man's. The ending with Tony Stark was a nice surprise and will help build excitement for an Avengers movie. The CGI was a good improvement over the 2003 version. Abodmination was especially cool looking. Here's to the hope for a sequel or at the very least Edward Norton in the Avengers!","

"redeyedtree","26 October 2008","No one can be Bill Bixby, no one should try. I saw Eric Bana in Hulk and was supremely disappointed. Let's see, where to start? I can understand that with the technology we now have all those larger than life comic characters can really come to life. The show did not have the use of such and so relied on a really big green guy and a great actor. IH tried for both, CGI with a touch of human. I think Hulk tried to make him too big, too sensational and too GCI looking. I like that IH didn't use a pretty boy (not to take anything from Eric) but rather an average Joe. I think they worked really hard to create an atmosphere closer to that of Bixby and his team. Hurt stepped way out of his comfort zone to put on a superb show. Liv and Roth did their part to make a movie worth watching over and over but the dark horse was Dr Stern. Tim was only on screen for a few minutes but his manic not as good as I look performance should turn heads for future projects.","

We are also introduced to the Abomination, a classic Hulk villain played by Tim Roth. The fight scenes between the two are awesome and really display great computer generated effects and graphics.Overall, The Incredible Hulk is an entertaining super hero film and I am looking forward to watching it again in the near future.","

"darkreignn","13 May 2021","""The Incredible Hulk"" starts strong - after a, admittedly, bizarrely edited opening credits sequence that is highly reminiscent of the frantic editing a la ""Saw,"" the movie begins almost as a political thriller, following Edward Norton's Bruce Banner as he is running from the U. S. government. It's an intriguing, exciting start, culminating in a parkour chase set piece that leads into our titular character making an appearance, all the while shrouded in shadow, as if we were watching a horror flick. And then, the tone shifts.2008's ""The Incredible Hulk"" feels like three movies in one, each of them, while entertaining, never fully developed enough to be truly enthralling. After the tight-knit drama that the first 30 minutes developed, the film turns into more typical fare - the tone, which was deathly serious and dark in the beginning, is now more lighthearted, with off-putting jokes and character moments that just don't mesh with what was previously shown to us. The action, too, is more loud and bombastic, which is, granted, a welcome change of pace, as you'll be privy to Hulk in all of his destructive glory.In this film, Hulk is out for blood - as the military attempts their best effort in capturing Bruce, the Hulk is unleashed upon them, with all of his bloodlust present. He obliterates tanks and helicopters full of soldiers, attempts to slice people in half with car doors, kicks people so hard that their bones pulverize from the impact, and is just all-around a villainous killing machine, and it's highly entertaining. I thought this was a very unique take on a superhero film, where the line between hero and villain was blurred. That is, until, the tone shifts again, and Hulk becomes a clear-cut hero who fights a clear-cut villain.The last act of this film is incredibly action packed and exciting; it is also typical of what you'd expect from a superhero film. The movie, which did its best effort to subvert audience expectations regarding what they expect to see in a superhero movie, now turns into exactly what the audience would expect to see from a superhero movie. This is inherently bad, as the action is genuinely thrilling, and the special effects still look great to this day. However, it is jarring, especially since the movie did such a good job of avoiding the cliche.""The Incredible Hulk"" isn't a bad film - it's actually pretty fun, if you can get over the fact that you're most likely watching multiple people's visions compiled into one film.","

"Cuahutli6","15 June 2008","Just saw the movie last night and I'm happy to say that I was very pleased with the movie. The first Hulk movie was kind of a let down. The Hulk was so over the top and unbelievable. He was made to be something that he wasn't. This one was was quite the opposite.From the start it I felt as though riding a roller coaster. A slow start a nice build up, then the trough, then once again a bigger build up then a long level ride. then the final heart thumping thrill ride that leaves you cheering and, like any adrenaline junkie, wanting so much more.I wish that they would have developed Betty Ross' character a little more but over all they did a great job.","

"Buddy-51","7 July 2008","Louis Leterrier's ""The Incredible Hulk"" dispenses with all the how-Dr.-Bruce-Banner-became-a-hulking-monster stuff in the opening credits (the result of gamma ray poisoning from an experiment that went terribly awry, for those who don't already know), thereby making the film more of a sequel to the Ang Lee version from 2003 than a remake of it (even though all the parts are played by different actors). Though far from perfect, that earlier ""Hulk"" was, I believe, unfairly pilloried for being just a tad too brooding and a trifle too thoughtful for a mind-numbing, feel-good summertime blockbuster (it WAS an Ang Lee film, after all). Well, most of that ""problem"" has been eliminated in this new version, which has streamlined its story into a virtual nonstop orgy of chase sequences, exploding vehicles and general CGI mayhem. The good news, though, is that ""The Incredible Hulk"" boasts the highly gifted Edward Norton as Bruce, who gives the film a human heart anyway.For the most part, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is one big long chase story interrupted by occasional romantic interludes between Bruce and his former girlfriend, Betty Ross (Live Tyler), the fellow scientist who accidentally helped to make Bruce the man/monster hybrid he is today. Bruce's main nemesis is Betty's father, General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), the military officer who wants to capture the young man - who has spent the last several years in hiding, futilely searching for a cure - so that he can replicate the experiment and turn out a veritable army of indestructible incredible hulks.Norton and Tyler make a fine romantic pair, and Tim Roth does his usual superlative job as the villainous (are there any other kind?) former KGB agent who wants to be first in line to volunteer to be ""hulked."" The filmmakers, moreover, manage to fork over a little screen time to Lou Ferrigno in a cameo appearance (he also provides the voice for the Hulk) and even the late Bill Bixby who shows up in a brief clip from TV's ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father."" The controversy over which of the two ""Hulk"" films is better (i.e. more faithful to the spirit of the original) is sure to rage on for years to come. I have no real desire to either enter the fray or belabor the point (I like them both about equally), but let me just say that this latest ""Hulk"" is really all about the action and, for the most part, it delivers on that level. But thanks to Norton and Tyler, like the Lee version, it has some much-needed soul as well.","

"scorcher86","15 June 2008","The new Hulk film was well made for a number of reasons. Without giving any major plot details, their were some really good reasons to see this movie.The movie was packed with action, had a believable romantic element to the film, although the plot was slightly rushed in the opening credits the remainder of the movie did a good job clearing up lingering questions, and of course spotting other famous comic book/ex-comic book stars is always fun.Overall, Ed Norton, Liv Tyler, and Tim Roth are believable in their respective roles and the energy throughout the film keeps you wanting to watch more. I definitely would recommend this movie along with Iron Man if you like to watch exciting action packed comic book movies!","

"alekspredator87","18 July 2022","""The Incredible Hulk"" was announced as an integral part of the new Marvel film franchise. Many were confused, considering the film a continuation of the 2003 project of the same name. But it was a completely different approach.A new story, but already in the opening credits themselves, shots are played that strongly resemble the action of the same 2003 film. Sometimes you think that it's really a continuation. However, a new story is shown here, with new actors and new enemies.The project is well supported by the play of the excellent actor Edward Norton. He has a lot of dramatic roles in his piggy bank. And here he proved himself no worse, although the film seems to be like a comic book. That's the beauty of it. And in such projects there is a place for good drama, the experiences of the characters, their evolution. Norton plays scientist Bruce Banner, who became a participant in the experiment and acquired a unique opportunity to become a green terrifying monster. But the whole movie we see him struggling with his alter ego. It is clear that he is tired of wandering, hiding, not sleeping. Norton conveys these emotions well. At the same time, his hero is purposeful and wants to ""heal"" somehow.His love interest, played by Liv Tyler, looks a little pale against the background of Norton. Although Liv is a good actress. I associate this with a scenario where the main focus is still on the Hulk and Banner.Tim Roth showed himself well. Villains always worked out well for him. Here, he can literally make a hole in the enemy with his eyes. And his Abomination, in my opinion, is the most disgusting character in all the films of the Marvel cinematic universe.The use of computer graphics was inevitable in such a film. After all, two monsters appeared in front of the audience at once. And it is clearly visible that technology has once again stepped forward. Everything looks decent and realistic.It is important to note that this picture is quite different from the rest of the films of the cinematic universe. This feeling does not leave ten years later. The ""Incredible Hulk"" drops out. The style is a little different.But the hero is alive and real. I want to look at him, empathize with him. You perfectly understand how a person feels when he is alone against the whole world. And almost no one undertakes to help him. You need to have the most powerful endurance to be safe for others, to go to extreme limits for yourself. I mean conflicts in which he can easily defeat others or intimacy with women, which entails another transformation into a monster.""The Incredible Hulk"" is a good film, slightly torn in the narrative, but quite interesting and necessary for the cinematic universe. He gathered his audience and revealed the character well. I coped with my task.9 out of 10.","

"lawrenceconwayvulcan","18 November 2018","After the 2003 angst ridden Hulk things took a change for a better with this more thrill laden movie. Ed (in the only time he played the role sadly) Norton plays Bruce Banner on the run from William Hurt's General Ross who is seeking to extract the blood that will give him super soldiers. Bruce turns to his old girlfriend (and Ross's daughter) Betty played by Liv Tyler. The General then brings in Emil (Tim Roth) Blonsky a British special forces operative who after his first confrontation with Banner's alter ego starts his own path to a transformation into a monster. The Incredible Hulk is full with amazing action scenes such as a chase through Rio and the final fight between Banner and Blonsky in their alter egos. This one fun ride of a movie.","

"pandya-kaustubh","20 June 2008","Okay guys its finally time to write my first ever movie review.For all those people who love super-heros, this is one movie for those people who enjoyed Iron Man as much as I did. For me, these two are movies in which a super-hero is portrayed in a very efficient manner.Though this movie has no connection with the first Hulk, but it does have a sort of connection in the way of portraying the problems the hero is facing with his ""problem"". I liked this movie as much as i did the first one. The director did do a very brilliant job. The desperateness of Bruce Banner to find an antidote, the craziness of Gen. Ross to capture Banner, Blonsky's desire to get more power, Betty Ross's willingness to help Banner all this has been shown in a very good manner. But the bet thing i liked was the amount of rage Hulk had been given, specially the time he screams.While talking about the cgi use in the film honestly speaking i like Abomination more than Hulk. The nerves and veins of hulk looked a bit overshown, but the most impressive was the anger expression that was shown on Hulk's face.Talking about action it was really really really awesome. Hulk's moves were totally wicked. His fight with Abomination looks like you are playing a King of fighters/Fatal Fury/Mortal Kombat on a more advanced version of playstation like PS8 or something. It was so totally cool. Not boring you guys more and not want to spoil the fun of those people who still haven't watch the movie, i will end this review now.Just wanna say one more thing. Guys do sure enjoy this movie.","

"kieran-wright","9 February 2009","OK, so it was with a certain amount of trepidation that I settled down to watch this, although admittedly I did enjoy the first Hulk film with Eric Bana. Just for a change, I'm not going to go on about how fantastic this film was, but I'm actually going to say that, had it not been for the ending of the showdown between The Hulk and Tim Roth's monster, which I found to be highly improbable and actually downright perplexing, I would have probably given this a 10. This is one of those rare films where, apart from about 1 minute or less, is actually flawless, and whereas my disappointment of this ending is in no way comparable to that which I experienced in 'No Country For Old Men', I was still left feeling disappointed - actually more disappointed for the director and the actors that this turned out to be a flawed masterpiece.","

"boe_dye","20 July 2008","Honestly, that's what kills this movie, and the previous one before that. Yeah it wasn't as artsy as the first one, but I actually liked the first one better for it's believability factor as opposed to this one which was just plain silly.And that's really what deep sixed this film for my was the CGI. I could have dealt with Norton's Banner...Okay that's just not true, he wasn't good for this part at all. And Liv Tyler played basically the same airy whispery voice role that she plays in all her films minus LOTR...But when oh when, and yes this is a pipe dream, will Hollywood stop using CGI on everything known to man? Honestly, that's why Hulk movies will always fail is because once the puny human banner goes bye bye, angry cartoon Hulk smashes...No emotion whatsoever in the character. His rage makes me want to laugh because it's so fake and engineered.At least when Ferrigno did it in the 80's he looked more believable then this stuff.Yeah it was campy, yeah it was basic, but it had so much more feeling in it then what we get today.All the hulk is anymore is a multimillion dollar Shrek meet's Who Framed Roger Rabbit.Honestly the only way to save the hulk is this: Put down the computers, put down the animation. Find a good makeup/costume designer and some super huge steroid head body builder, and go to town.It works with the Thing in FF. It works in Hellboy. It can work here very good here.In the end, this movie left me bored, and not caring less what happened in the ""surprise"" left open for a sequel finale'.","

"Velociraptor256","12 October 2008","While this new Hulk film isn't the best superhero movie of 2008, it's a vast improvement on the 2003 version (which demonstrated that it is in fact possible to make a film about a big green monster fuelled by rage, that's actually boring).This time round, there's no pointless character-development scenes that keep the film dragging on forever: the pacing's much better, with most (if not all) of the scenes remaining relevant and keeping you entertained. The film begins with some brief origin scenes before we find Bruce Banner hiding in Brazil  he's looking for an antidote to his condition, and ends up going home looking for help, but he's being pursued by the army who want to harness his power as a weapon. The overall plot is, again, more straightforward than the 2003 version, and flows nicely.As in the last film, there's not quite as much Hulk as there could have been, but when the Hulk's around, he leaves more of an impression. He looks more detailed, and certainly angrier, and he spends more time doing what the Hulk does best: smashing. The action scene where he takes on the Army on a university campus is exciting and well filmed, but his climactic battle with the Abomination is one of the best superhero battles I've ever seen: watching these two monsters tear up the scenery and effortlessly throw each other around, striking with speed and hardly ever stopping for breath, is just fantastic.There's not much to say on the actors playing the three main characters, Edward Norton, Liv Tyler and William Hurt  they all give performances which are nothing special, but satisfactory. Tim Roth's performance as Emil Blonsky is more noteworthy: while in human form, he gives us an entertaining antagonist that I wish I'd seen more of. His final transformation into the Abomination is a bit sudden after the gradual self-improvement that takes place through the rest of the film, but that's just a little gripe  the Abomination itself looks brilliant (the bones sticking out are a nice touch).Overall, this film won't blow you away, but it's a good summer action movie that's definitely worth a look.","

"gbx06","15 July 2008","If someone was waiting for a film that really shows a Hulk as it is, then I must say that this is the movie that always wanted to see about this character. ""The incredible Hulk"" has many qualities that make it off completely form the stylized and a little boring Ang Lee's version, who although isn't a bad movie, but it didn't meet the expectations of an adaptation more serious of this comic. What are the differences that make this film better than its earlier? Lets start from the beginning. This version of Hulk resume, in its initial sequence of credits, everything that someone who does not know anything about comics should know to understand the story. This movie didn't deny the Ang Lee film, actually takes up the fact that Bruce Banner has fled to a place in South America and from there begins the story as a kind of sequel. Another success is that strips the movie completely of greater existential reflections and makes it what it is par excellence, a ribbon of pure entertainment, with big action sequences, chases and fights between giant monsters that make this version of Hulk more like the comic, but also has its romantic side and the human and painful part of Bruce Banner, but not focuses only one hour on that.Visually the Hulk design compared to that of Ang Lee is much more stylized, less coarse than the last and most rugged, looks even stronger than the Lee's, while the FX are used much more stylized and harmonics, they are more precise, which results in sequences, like the battle of the university, that are really spectacular. Finally the choice of players compete much with the casting of the previous movie, but I think that is better the choice of Norton than Bana, and more beautiful Liv Tyler than Jennifer Connelly. Excellent choice of William Hurt and Tim Roth as ""the villains"" and much better even the preamble to ""The Avengers"" with Tony Stark.For these reasons, this is for me the real Hulk.","

"liberalgems","20 June 2008","It's a bad sign when you hear members of the audience groan! But its not hard to figure out why! This movie was marketed as appropriate for adult audiences, but if the filmmakers were honest they would have marketed The Incredible Hulk strictly as a child/young teen flick, instead.It's been a long time since I seen such a boring and tedious film! Even Iron Man with all its many flaws was better than this sorry story! And what's up with Edward Norton? His acting was so bad it felt like he was reading off of a teleprompter! It was incredibly distracting. Was he drugged, or something? - One thing is for certain: Bill Bixby, he ain't!I also got a laugh out of Hollywood thinking an American audience is so dumb about world geography they would believe the teeming slums of some major city in Brazil is next to the Guatemalan/Mexican border! - Let's say you are in Northern Brazil. To make it to the Guatemalan/Mexican border you have to go through either Venezuela, Columbia or both! Then you must cross through Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and then Honduras. Quite a distance! But the Incredible Hulk, who has neither wings, nor magic, nor teleporting abilities or a private jet, makes it all the way to the Guatemalan/Mexican border in less than a night!Memo to Hollywood: I know your going for the quick buck after losing so much money during the Writer's strike! There have been so many awful movies this past Spring (2008) that I'm getting worn out! But I'm an optimistic person. Could you please, please, make you next Comic Book related film as brilliant as Spiderman #3, X-Men #2, the last Superman film or as good as any of the six Star Wars films? Is that asking too much? There are adults who like a good story just as much as you (Hollywood) like to make a ton of money!","

"mr_popcorn","14 June 2008","This reboot to 2003's Hulk starring Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth and William Hurt did precisely what it was made to do: to be an all out, guns-blazing, hell-hath-no-fury fighting, bone crunching summer blockbuster. The main problem with the first Hulk is that it took itself too seriously, it had more talk and less action and I'm no Einstein but the best place for a 10 foot tall, green beast is in a street duking it out with a 10 foot tall brownish abomination with spikes shooting out in his back. The reboot just did that. It may have not been a 30 minute fight scene as promised but still, we are treated with such a visual spectacle you will be on the edge of your seats until the Hulk does his trademark move, the ""HULK SMASH!"".This version of Hulk is a lot better than Ang Lee's because first, the people behind the film embraced the idea of the Hulk being a less-talk-more-action kind of guy, second, the Hulk is actually just seven feet tall in the comics not 15 feet tall like what Ang Lee depicted in his version, this film stayed true to the roots of Hulk and they stuck with a shorter, brawnier, much greener version of him and it worked out pretty well in the end. Edward Norton, always the excellent actor, was stellar in this one. His portrayal of Bruce Banner is much more melancholic, emotional, desperate and you sympathize with his plight. Eric Bana's performance was okay but I find Edward Norton's much better and not only because he is my most favorite actor of all but if you look at it really carefully, you can see that he is truly the embodiment of Bruce Banner. He really connected with the character and I'm impressed.Tim Roth on the other hand, who plays villain Emil Blonsky aka Abomination, gave a very spooky performance. He really dug in to the Emil character and it was pretty amazing. The scene where he in human form, approaches the Hulk shooting grenades at him and then goes all karate kid on him with the backflips and the hand gun, oh my god, that scene will really shake you to the bone. It shows how fearless he is and his drive to destroy Hulk will ultimately consume him in the end. Amazing performance from both the hero and the villain.Other cast mates includes Liv Tyler as Bruce's ladylove Betty Ross and William Hurt as the guy who wants to harness the Hulk's power, General Ross. Their performances were quite good. Its a step away from the performances in the 2003 version. Lou Ferrigno who played Hulk sometime ago makes a cameo as a security guard and as usual, Stan Lee, the creator also makes a special appearance as the guy who drank that Brazilian soda punch. And of course the creme de la creme of all cameos is that of Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark who makes a quick little chit chat with General Ross about this ""group""(read: The Avengers) they're making for which General Ross replies ""What group?"" and Stark with a funny look in his face. It only means one thing: come 2011, I'll be the first in line in the Avengers movie, I'm already there.The Incredible Hulk is a lot better than 2003's Hulk and I can give you a 1,001 reasons why. A worthy addition to the Marvel movies collection.7/10","

"rabrenner","22 June 2008","The first Hulk movie was a major disappointment. Ang Lee is a great director, but he fundamentally misunderstood the character. The Hulk is not about Bruce Banner's unresolved Freudian conflicts with his father. Nor is it about fighting giant, gamma-irradiated French poodles.Now along comes Hulk 2.0. Director Louis Leterrier and writer Zak Penn don't have Lee's talent or budget, but have created a more enjoyable, albeit cheesier, movie by sticking closer to the source material. Watch for cameos by Stan Lee, Lou Ferrigno, Bill Bixby, and Robert Downey Jr. in his Tony Stark role.The first half of the movie works best: after an efficient opening sequence that gets the origin out of the way, we switch to Bruce Banner as a super powered fugitive, on the run from the US Army, and hiding out in São Paulo. (A nod to the first movie, which ended with Banner hiding in Latin America.) Ed Norton looks sufficiently haunted and emaciated to make this work. The Hulk is wisely kept in shadow and only shown in bits and pieces.The second half of the movie starts showing some cracks. The Hulk doesn't look like Shrek this time, but he still doesn't look believable. Maybe it's impossible for CGI to render a nine foot tall, two ton green giant convincingly. Worse, the personal conflictsBanner with Betty Ross; Betty with her father, General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross; the General with Bannerfeel perfunctory, as if Leterrier and Penn are just filling time until the final throwdown with the Abomination. Here, they could have learned a thing or two from Lee, who excels at personal conflict.","

It makes you hate the 2003 version and almost makes you become obsessed with it. Edward Norton plays his role amazingly as Bruce Banner, where he is wanted as a fugitive and is being hunted down by the government, whose malicious intention is to manipulate his gene and use it as a weapon in the U.S. military. Edward Norton plays a die hard fugitive who is not willing to give into the government's plans, and his performance almost makes you forget about Dr. Richard David Kimble(Harrison Ford in The Fugitive). We see Bruce Banner transform into this gigantic beast in numerous scenes, and those scenes are highly intense and involve hi-tech machinery and amazing fight sequences. Alongside Bruce Banner, we see Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, a caring and lovable character.Tim Roth also played a villain perfectly. Overall, This film contains both great action and a storyline that's everything but superficial.9.5/10","

"jctundis","21 June 2008","Ahhh... at last I have a Hulk movie that I'll be happy (and able) to watch again.The new Incredible Hulk is, first and foremost, an action movie. It's not Iron Man (which is a phrase that you'll probably see again and again as more Marvel movies are released). I gave Hulk an 8, while Iron Man got a 10.Once again, Marvel has created a hybrid movie combining elements of the Ultimate Universe (most notably the origin), mainstream Marvel Universe and the classic TV show starring the late Bill Bixby (there are several nods to the show including the theme song and an appearance - and voice work - by Lou Ferrigno).How does the CGI stand up? Much better than the Lee film. The daylight scenes are very impressive - and there is a scene in a rainstorm that is absolutely brilliant! No lame gamma-irradiated poodles in this one, folks.What I'm really looking forward to now is the Blu-Ray release which will have all of the Edward Norton penned scenes (many of which constituted the original trailer) restored. The one thing that kept me from giving this movie a higher score was the feeling of ""pulling back"" from dramatic scenes. Norton is brilliant as Banner (as he is in most movies) and the dramatic punch that he will bring to the full length release fills me with anticipation. This is hinted at in a few poignant scenes before the viewer is thrust back into the action - and what action it is, especially when Tim Roth hits the screen.I really hope Norton returns - a situation that is in doubt - and picks up with the villain that long time Hulk fans will recognize as being created during this film.After being disgusted by the 3rd installments of Spider-Man and X-Men, I am fully on board with these new Marvel Studios productions. Bring on Thor, Captain America and The Avengers! HULK SMASH!","

"dilipbts","7 June 2020","I attended a sneak preview of The Incredible Hulk last night. Incredible? No, but Very Good. And it washes the bad taste left in my mouth from Indiana Jones and the Big Letdown. The story is good, the acting is awesome. Ed Norton is the perfect person to play the tormented Bruce Banner. He is more believable in the roll than Eric Bana. Liv Tyler is very good as Betty Ross (formally played by the tasty Jennifer Connelly) William Hurt as General Ross is impressive and makes for a worthy adversary to Bruce Banner. If I had to come up with a negative, it would be Tim Roth. While I really like him, and he always plays great villains, I feel he's just miss cast here. He seems tiny next to General Ross. Instead of coming off like the English bad ass special op he's supposed to be, he comes off more like a jerk with Napoleon Syndrome. Someone more physically imposing like Vinnie Jones (Bullet tooth from Snatch), or Daniel Craig (the new Bond) would have been more convincing for the part. But I'm just picking here. The movie is a joy. Great action. No long boring, dragging development stuff that the first Hulk had in spades. There are some very nice cameos as well. Some were a surprise, some were not. I didn't see Nick Fury anywhere except in a brief headline in a montage. However I did not remain through the credits, so there might have been a scene at the end like Iron Man that I don't know about. I give it ***1/2 out of ****. I also predict it to make 80+million this weekend when it opens to the public and should ""Hulk Smash"" the competition. The movie received an ovation from the audience at the end which sums it up. A worthy movie made for the fans and everyone else.","

"hypestyle","16 June 2008","Grade: B- ""The Incredible Hulk"" is technically the second theatrical release based on the Marvel Comics super-hero. However, this film, directed by Louis Leterrier (The Transporter 2, Unleashed) apparently ignores the events of 2003's adjective-free Hulk which was directed by Ang Lee. Lead actor Edward Norton plays haunted scientist Bruce Banner in addition to contributing a script draft which was conditional upon his hiring as an actor (the WGA gives Zak Penn final official credit for the screenplay).The story continuesor begins againthe saga of former research scientist Dr. Banner, whose body was drastically mutated in the aftermath of a botched experiment involving improving human resistance to radiation. Now, in times of extreme anger or stress, Banner's gamma-irradiated cells expand exponentially, turning him into the outsized, super-muscled Hulkdriven by rage and prone to lash out at his tormentors with little restraint.General Thaddeus Ross (played by William Hurt) was present at the experiment that birthed the Hulk, as was his daughter Betty (Liv Tyler). Obsessed with bringing the fugitive Banner into custody, the general recruits a special commando unit, including one Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), on loan from the British military. When the general's team finally tracks down Banner to a Brazilian shantytown, things begin to go downhill for both Banner and the generalthe Hulk is unleashed and makes short work of everyone involved. But while most of the team is at least humbled by this turn of events, it only intrigues Blonsky, who then volunteers to be injected with a top-secret performance-enhancement cocktail.Unfortunately, the grim Blonsky doesn't remotely have the conscience of Banner, and he becomes increasingly aggressive in his attempts to bring down his quarry. Meanwhile, the trouble-prone scientist hitchhikes from Latin America all the way to the Virginia college where he and Betty worked. Stumbling into an awkward reunion with his former love, a second Hulk flare-up prompts the two to head to New York City, where a heretofore mysterious colleague of Banner has the equipment necessary to attempt a curebut the dogged Blonsky's lust for combat derails everything; his own mutation spins out of control, turning him into the monster Abomination. With military personnel literally being crushed by this new creature, a reluctant Banner realizes that the only thing that can stop the rampaging Blonsky may be the Hulk.If one is apt to believe circulating entertainment reports, Norton was allegedly miffed with Marvel studio executives who wanted a leaner, more action-driven final cut of the film compared to Ang Lee's slower, ponderous interpretation. As viewed, the film is a taut action vehicle, essentially becoming a chase thriller after the first Hulk-eruption. Quieter moments such as when Bruce and Betty first reunite or trailer-glimpsed scenes of an Arctic sojourn and Bruce's chat with a psychologist (Ty Burrell) are either truncated or not seen at all. Marvel Studios is self-financing their comic-strip based features now, so there is legitimate commercial concern here.Still, accommodating viewers who don't have stunted attention spans isn't really that bad. The Lord of the Rings movies found a way to keep the story literate and the action exciting. While prose-fiction hardliners may blanch at comparing Stan Lee's comic-book series to Tolkien, it helps to bear in mind that cool art-visuals alone aren't enough to keep a comic-book going for 45 years like the Hulk. The story, whether simple or complex, still needs to be in place. Hopefully it won't be another five years (or longer) before the Hulk shows up at cinema again, and maybe his handlers will believe in him enough to make the narrative as strong as the spectacle.","

"Happy_Evil_Dude","6 August 2008","Let me start off by saying that Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk is NOT a bad movie. In fact, as of writing it has 5.1 rating on IMDb and an critical approval of 61% on Rotten Tomatoes (this one is currently at 65%). Ang Lee did a lot of cool stuff in his film and had a talented cast, Eric Bana was good as Bruce Banner. Overall however, the Ang Lee film suffered from being too ambitious and overly complicated, and simply not being what the audience expected. The audience went in expecting to see ""Hulk smash"", and got a more cerebral film than they expected, even though there was still plenty of action (Hulk did swing tanks around after all!). It is true however that action scenes in Hulk weren't the coolest, which also contributed to the negative reputation it enjoys.The Incredible Hulk writer Zak Penn (also responsible for X-Men 2 & 3, Elektra and Behind Enemy Lines), director Louis Letterier (of the Luc Besson productions Transporter 1 & 2 and Danny The Dog/Unleashed) and actor Edward Norton (who contributed greatly to the screenplay, though he is uncredited) took the complaints over Ang Lee's film into account and aren't overly concerned with continuity in this sequel. It is mentioned that 5 years have passed and the film starts in Brasil while Lee's film ends there, but the origin of Hulk is changed in the opening credits to resemble more the famous 70s TV series (references to said series abound).The film is more fast-paced than Lee's effort, and while there actually isn't that much more action here (both films have 3 main action scenes), it is certainly better-made and definitely cooler. The story is certainly less cerebral but it's not a throwaway either. There are characters here, and they do go through something. As for people criticizing the CGI, well that just baffles me...just hows realistic do you expect a green muscled giant stomping around to be? The effects of the 2003 movie were already very good and they're even better here. They could have done a few things slightly better interaction-wise, true, but they're still very good.In addition, I love how Marvel movies are starting to reference each other (we have here references to Nick Fury/S.H.I.E.L.D., Tony Stark/Stark Industries, the Avengers and Captain America). This is way cool and I wish they could it for characters whose rights are owned by other companies, such as Fox, Columbia or New Line. Stan Lee's cameo is probably his best one yet and the Lou Ferrigno appearance is way cool. The guy who voiced the Hulk in one of the animated series also appears, as does Bill Bixby, indirectly.Almost as good as Iron Man, this 2008 Hulk enters the hall of the best Marvel movies along with Blade 1, the first two X-Men, Iron Man, Spider-Man 1 and The Punisher ""2004 version"" (yes, I love The Punisher), and succeeds in bettering Ang Lee's underrated movie. With great action and the cool factor in spades, The Incredible Hulk should satisfy all your action blockbuster needs and leave you wanting to see Hulk smash some more. The only minor gripes I have with it are the unnecessary retconning of Lee's movie and the fact that I sincerely doubt that they asked any cast member of the first film if they wanted to return (I definitely would have preferred Jennifer Connelly reprising her role to Liv Tyler stepping in...what is it with movie sequels replacing pretty girls with unpretty ones? Maggie Gyllenhall in The Dark Knight and Liv Tyler in Hulk, sheesh!).Well that's it. Good movie. Good action movie, that is, not good ""potentially an Oscar-nominee"" movie, but you should already suspect that if you know anything about this film. So yes, this is a good action blockbuster, a great one actually, one of they very best of the quite strong 2008 summer movie season.Now vote that my review was helpful or you'll make me angry...and you wouldn't like me when I'm angry...","

"strongbad1","20 June 2008","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS Before i go into my review, i must comment on the hulk film that came before.Ang lee made a beautiful film, all the players involved were great. The desert battle was the highlight of that piece and the cinematography was beautiful. Ubfortuneatly An Lee made a movie with the hulk in it, not a hulk film The orgin was too complex and over drawn and the whole scientific approach to explain the hulk didn't really make sense. Plus the hulk looked more like a giant green man (although in some scenes he was pure hulk).Over all it wasn't the hulk i wanted to see.Now , The incredible hulk on the other hand IS a hulk film and a very good one at that . Right off the bat we are introduced to everyone to all the characters in the story ( with a nice nod to the TV series) . Gone is the 45 minute explanation of how Bruce is the hulk and we are thrown right into his life as he is desperately trying to rid himself of his ill tempered alter ego. We are also introduced to the hulk right at the beginning of the film ( which was one of my fav scenes i n the film) After the first hulk out, Bruce banner ( ed Norton) heads off to find Betty Ross ( played wonderfully by live Tyler) to try and find a cure his anger issues.The story moves at a great pace with little bits of humor thrown in the mix ( the purple pants bit was classic). The special effects are as promised a lot darker and this time out the hulk looks more like a real monster. Wilam hurt's general Ross and Tim Roth's Emil blonskey make great villains ( the later being the best of them). The inclusion of Samuel sterns provides a great setup for the inevitable sequel. Marvel got Right this for sure ....so what doesn't work? The final battle between Hulk and the abomination could have been a little longer. There were some scenes that moved a little too slow but these are just minor issues. Of course the part that made me smile the most was the delivery of the most famous words the hulk has ever spoken HILK SMASH! which comes in at good time .With iron man under their belt and the hulk being a great compliment, marvel is really getting their act together... all leading up to the moment we fans have been waiting for ( spoilers alert) AVENGERS ASSMEBLE! i almost forgot the last sense marvels man of iron steps in to delight us with the surprises to come en spoilers i gave this film an8 out of 10 , good job by everyone evolved HULK SMASH!","

"barrys82","14 June 2008","The incredible Hulk opens its way as one of the best action movies of the season. With a completely new adaptation of the movie combining parts from the comic and parts from the 70's T.V. series, the film comes full of action and adventure, a good story of love and even some humor moments. It was like an adrenaline shot right to the heart. The CGI and special effects are really great. We can see a more realistic, more human Hulk, of course that they still can make it better. The movie is full of references of the Marvel Universe like the brief appearance of Tony Stark talking about The Avengers. The cast is awesome, all-star actors and actresses like Edward Norton with a flawless performance, it's like he was born to be Bruce Banner, the character really fits him, Liv Tyler in the role of Betty Ross is great so sweet and cute. Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky a.k.a Abomination was the perfect villain and William Hurt give a convincing performance as General Ross. the brief cameos of Robert Downey Jr. Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee were a great add to the movie. In conclusion, this is by far a better Hulk movie than the one of 2003. Enjoyable, entertaining. One of the best movies of the season.","

"raimorio","15 June 2008","I had the pleasant opportunity to see this movie last night in the theater. If you need a quick answer this is it: It is a movie of quality. It contains superb acting, top notch CGI, good plot (although differing a little from the original comic book version) and it is nicely directed.I know most of you will like/like the Ironman more. I personally liked this more because in the ironman there wasn't enough ""superhero"" action. There was action etc but it just didn't go much on the superhero side of action in ironman. In Hulk there's an appropriate amount of action and it is cooler than in Ironman. In Ironman he didn't use his superpowers much. If you compare for example the final battle's of these movies you will know the difference.There is something in this movie that makes it a quality movie. I could say that it has ""that"" something. Much like Ironman did. I tried to figure out what it was. I've heard that the first Hulk movie starring Eric Bana had the same budget as this movie, but the first one ended up being totally mediocre. I can't point any single thing that makes these movies great, they just simply appear to be made of quality. Guess in the end you have to give creds to the director and the actors. Give any script to a good director and he will turn it into something much greater, give a good script to a bad director and it ends up being cr*p.All I can say is that this movie is made of quality in every aspect. It absorbs you in from the moment it starts. It's fast paced. You feel for the main character. There's a sip of humor in it that works. The actors do a great job, especially Edward Norton and Liv Tyler(I would marry her anyday, she is so cute when she speaks or is sad, she looks like she really cares). Edward Norton is basically the best actor on this planet for this role. He is skinny, nerdy, intelligent, but not ugly, his voice is cool. He is the perfect Bruce Banner. In fact everything about the main character is cool and is presented as cool, from the mind control stuff to the fighting and from the fighting to him being the intelligent professor.There are some arguments that Tim Roth is miscast as ""Emil Blonsky"" in this movie. I disagree. I think its great that this veteran army dude who is the toughest soldier on the planet is not some athletic guy but looks more ordinary than my dad. Because in this movie his toughness doesn't come from him being the new he-man only with bigger abs but it comes from his experience on the field and the fact that he considers himself as a ""fighter"" despite his age etc. I think its way cooler seeing some ordinary guy in swat gear doing things in a calm way, moving like they do etc. Thats why I liked the Bourne trilogy as well. Cuz Bourne doesn't necessarily do anything flashy, he just walks calmly but knows exactly what he is doing. Although when it comes to big muscles and crazy fight scenes this movie delivers more than well. The other thing is that I really admire Tim Roths characters will to fight. He does it because he likes it and because Tim Roth isn't the athletic dude from the gym it makes it much cooler and more admirable, being just an ordinary guy but still wanting to fight because of the sheer fun of fighting.This movie does its job more than well. It is an action flick of quality. If you are hesitating whether you should see it or not, don't. Go see it, now.","

"jerekra","10 March 2009","Before I start this review I just want to say that I actually liked the hulk film that was made a few years ago in 2003. I liked this one too and it is better in some aspects than the other hulk film and worse than the other hulk film in some ways also.The story is basically involving Bruce Banner and how he must be on the run constantly. THis is because there are some in the military who want to use his mutation into the hulk to aid the military. One soldier in particular is infected by the same type of mutation and becomes a hulk monster whom Banner must battle to save humanity.First I should say that this film tends to try to ignore the other hulk film completely. It is a remake of sorts not a follow up. I guess this is because they felt that the other hulk film was a disappointment.I thought the beginning of the film really lacked in story. THere are some brief scenes during the opening credits that show how Banner became the hulk but for the most part during the whole film Banner is the hulk already and they do not explain how he became the hulk at all. I guess this makes sense but it got me confused. If they wanted to redo the hulk film completely wouldn't they want to show how he became the hulk in the first place? But this does lead to there being more action and I guess the people assumed that most people who are watching this film do not care too much about how Banner became the hulk and just want to see action.THere is a lot of good action in this film. I really like the bad guy in this film and how the main bad guy is another hulk like evil looking creature. The battle between Banner and the other hulk is a pretty good battle.The acting is good. Not outstanding. I liked Edward Norton a lot in ""American History X"" and ""Rounders"" and I thought he was a good choice to play Banner in this film. He really does an effective job portraying a man who must live with the problem he possesses and must deal with other people who want to find him due to the problem he has.Liv Tyler never has wowed me in any film I have seen her in and it was more of the same in this film. Nothing outstanding and sometimes lacking. COuld have chosen a better leading lady actor.Quickly I would just like to say I thought it was interesting how Robert Downey Jr. appears briefly as Tony Stark. That cameo I thought was awesome as it may lead to more great Marvel Films in the future.So this is a good film. Does not really do a good job explaining how Banner became the hulk but I think they did that on purpose. But the acting by Norton was good and there is a lot of good action. I recommend it.","

"PlayerSS","14 June 2008","Although my personal bias as a Hulk fan will probably sway my opinion on that.5 years ago I watched Ang Lee's Hulk. I really liked it and couldn't understand why everyone was hating on it. Specifically comic book fans. The more I watched it though the more I started seeing pacing problems with the movie. Three years after I watched the movie I went and got every single Hulk comic I could find. I was in for a shock. The movie wasn't faithful to the comics at all. Reading the comics turned me against the movie entirely.Needless to say I was a bit cautious whenever this one was announced. I got more optimistic whenever it was revealed that Ed Norton was being cast as Bruce. They couldn't have gotten anyone better. Eric Bana was a terrible choice. Then more casting reveals came along. For the biggest part I was happy about most of them. Except for William Hurt as General Ross. I felt one of the only things that the 03 movie got right was Sam Elliot as General Ross.Then the trailers came. I wasn't impressed with anything I seen in the trailers. I was still willing to give it a chance, but I was more pessimistic now than ever.After watching the movie though I can safely say the trailers didn't do it justice. It made me do a 180. This movie is the best piece of Hulk work outside of the comics. One of my worries was that since the 03 Hulk was a bit heavy with the story. This movie was going to go the opposite route and be all action and nothing else.While this may be somewhat the case, the action is incredible. Abomination and Hulk's blows were thunderous. There was a big chunk of character development on Bruce Banner, but certain things could have been expanded upon. Like General Ross, Dr. Samson, and Betty. Other little things could have been expanded upon as well, but Marvel was worried that this one would be too story heavy and not enough action like the 03 version. In the end the action being so great made up for the slight sacrifice in character and story development.Liv Tyler I thought did a good job as Betty. She played the innocent love role well. I know some critics are bashing her for whatever reason. I thought she was good.Now to touch on the negatives. Just two big ones that stuck out to me. As I mentioned earlier I loved Elliot as Ross in the 03 Hulk movie. Hurt was no Ross. I never could completely buy him as Ross through out the movie. I kept thinking on how great Elliot would have been if he were back in the role.The second was the Abomination's design. Being a comic book geek now Abomination's design irked me more than anything whenever I very first seen the trailer. I see lots of people say that the comic book design makes no sense, but this ""is"" a movie based off of a ""comic book"". Gamma affects people in different ways in the comic. The comic design differed him from Hulk's look. Which I felt was the exact thing was wrong with him here with his design. He looked too much like a bald Hulk clone. I'm not as down on it as I was, but I still prefer the comic book version any day.I thought they went a bit overboard with the TV show homages. I don't like the show. I don't mind the cameo by Lou here and there. The TV show did help Hulk reach get more mainstream, but by that same logic why isn't all the current Batman movies homaging and using elements from the Adam West Batman show? Like I said I'll give credit where credit is due and to the movies credit it does strike a nice balance trying to please both sides, but Batman Begins has shown that you can make a superhero movie with 100 percent of it's inspiration derived from the comics and still be successful and good.The CGI was great. Way better than the 03 version. The Hulk looked great and they went through a lot of trouble creating the battles the Hulk is in. This is getting too long. Probably my longest review yet. Finally they got the Hulk right. I'm hoping there will be a sequel.","

"james.p.taylor","12 June 2008","Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is on the run from the American military. Holed up in a favela in Rio, he's trying to live a calm life while searching for a cure for his 'condition' when through a complete accident he's discovered. A snatch team are sent to pick him up, led by Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), and all hell is let loose.Having escaped Brazil and finding himself on his way back to America, Banner finds his old love Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) and the passion is reignited. But Blonsky wants revenge for the beating he took when first sent to catch Banner.I want to like this film. I really do. If ever there was an actor who was good at portraying tortured souls, characters with inner demons, it's Norton. So why does his try at the ultimate tortured soul with the mother of all inner demons not work? I think that's the question that'll hang over this film.The highlights are Tyler, the emotional heart of the film. She and Norton have a chemistry, but even this can't seem to light the film up any. Roth also shows his talent and brings an essentially two dimensional character to life, until he vanishes under a tonne of CG.The effects are good and well used. The direction is okay. The action scenes (certainly the first two big chases are), but the finale is poor and doesn't live up to what's come before.The film seems to try to make a fresh start, including a montage at the start covering the origin story as it now stands. But there are a few places where it seems to try to tie into the Ang Lee film and it sits uncomfortably.It's not bad, but there's so much more it could have been. And don't sit through the credits waiting for an extra scene.","

"undeaddt","22 January 2019","This movie is pure awesomeness. I don't understand why people were so much hating on it when in reality it is an amazing Marvel movie. Edward Norton was over the top, his acting skills are astonishing and he fits the calm, but in reality out of control personality of Banner perfectly. Abomination was also a very well made anti-hero and the fight at the end was great. I hope that they had really good reasons not to take Edward Norton further in the MCU and I hope that it was his fault for not beeing selected for the Avengers cast.","

"tburke85","30 May 2009","The Incredible Hulk does justice to the popular comic book character giving audiences what they expect from one of these movies. Ang Lee's version of the Hulk wasn't that bad with some cool action sequences but it was long and a bit of a disappointment. This reboot gets it right and this is the one they should have done first. With a whole new cast and director The Hulk is back. It may not be as good as the Dark Knight or Iron Man but it's still an entertaining comic book brought to the big screen. Director Louis Leterrier does an excellent job at keeping the story moving at a steady pace with just the right amount of Hulk action throw in that fans of these type of films crave. This time around Edward Norton plays brilliant scientist Bruce Banner. Eric Bana played him in the film by Ang Lee who did a decent job with that role. But Norton inhabits the role of Banner and becomes that character. Norton's Banner is a cursed man desperately looking for a cure of the rage that lies within him waiting to be unleashed. With films like Primal Fear, Fight Club, and Pride and Glory, Edward Norton continues to establish as an extremely gifted actor. Liv Tyler steps into the role of Bruce's love Betty Ross taking over for Jennifer Connelly who did a good job with that role. Tyler's Betty is a beautiful smart scientist who loves Bruce and hates what her father has done to him. She proves to be another effective actress in the talented cast. Well done. The rest of the cast are admirable in their roles including Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky a soldier with a thirst for power who will go through a similar experiment like Bruce that transforms him into a nightmarish beast known as the Abomination. Roth makes for an effective villain but his role in the movie unfortunately is cut short because for the last twenty minutes or so he lets his CGI counterpart take over. Other then that Roth is great at playing a villain with a lust for power. William Hurt takes over for Sam Elliot (who was good in the other one) as General Thunderbolt Ross who just happens to be Betty's father and Bruce's rival. Hurt doesn't really have much to do in the movie but he does an admirable job with the role. Hurt's Ross is a man obsessed to create a super soldier who's willing to bend the rules in order to protect his country and get what he wants. Tim Blake Nelson has a small role as Samuel Sterns. He brings some comic relief to the film and does a great job with his brief appearance in the movie. The special effects are much better than the first one, the Hulk and the Abomination looked realistic, even though you know it's CGI. All the action is intense and well choreographed I especially enjoyed the first chase sequence because it felt very real and not something made up in a computer. The battle royale at the end was cool but it did feel a bit anti-climatic and didn't last very long either like the one in Iron Man. There's always a surprise cameo at the end by another popular comic book character who had his own movie that came out the same year this one did for those of you who haven't seen it. I won't tell you who it is but for those of you who have seen it you know which cameo I'm talking about. Despite its few flaws the Incredible Hulk is much better than expected and is an improvement over the first attempt to bring this popular character to the big screen. With plenty of action, chases, explosions, drama, and thrills, if this sounds like a movie you'd enjoy than go see the Incredible Hulk. It's sure to please anyone looking for an above average comic book to watch.","

"arieliondotcom","26 July 2009","I was disappointed at first for nearly the first half of the film. Unnecessary gore that makes the film a bad idea for younger children & very obvious & not very well done computer graphics made me nearly give up on it. However, once the Big Green Guy meets up with ""Mr Blue"" everything comes together nicely, including a much improved special effects scene. Typical for Marvel movies, like the comics, there's plenty of pathos though it at times borders on the pathetic. This is no Spider Man (my fav) but there's enough meat & mayhem to entertain Marvel Maniacs like myself. So green means go ahead & watch this movie. But don't let your expectations get too high or you'll end up seeing red.","

"mardalsfossen01","11 January 2019","What bothered me about the 2003 Hulk, it was very lengthy. Somehow they managed the 2008 reboot to be as well in parts. But it is not as bad !
They added some nice sequences and things which I really liked, but not gonna list now due to Spoilers. Probably most boring are the scenes between Betty and Bruce Banner/Hulk. Can't say I am a Liv Tyler fan.
Also the CGI sequences are better, more creative and improved effects. Hulk's body looks more defined; I am not sure if they hit the spot with his face, but it's improved technique-wise.
Overall it is not AS lengthy as the 2003 version, they improved some things. I think it's decent and a foundation for future movies.","

"mirosuionitsaki2","19 June 2008","Although I barely remember the first movie, I can truly say that this movie might have been better than the first one. It was filled with shock, action, excitement, romance, and yes, even a little comedy was put in there. It was an amazing movie I saw yesterday and I might go see it again. I think this movie is going to make it big in the box office.I think this movie really started the franchise of Marvel's Hulk and put the original Hulk film below. This is a recommended film to see that is fun for almost everybody. If you have seen and loved the original Hulk film or have been interested in watching one of the movies, watch the 2008 one. You'll enjoy it.","

It could've been worse, it could've been better.Ange Lee's Hulk movie at least tried to inject a personal point of view to the tired franchise, this one's just big mainstream stuff. In the end, both movies get the same rating. Life's unfair.5 out of 10 bad Hulks","

"kaden_lewis","11 June 2021","In my opinion, this is an extremely underrated movie. The IMDb rating is currently 6.7/10, I think it should be a 7.5/10 minimum (There is no 7.5, I rounded up to 8). The first half of the movie in my opinion was very good, I liked that Bruce was on the run, and decided to hide in the Brazilian Favelas, I just liked the aspect of it. Then the United States military came in and forced him to run, until he turned into the Hulk and rampaged all the way to Guatemala. Bruce then made his way up through Mexico and back into the States where he reunited with his old girlfriend. The beginning of the second half of the movie wasn't all that exciting, but then the final battle was crazy. Two huge Hulk-ish beings fighting on the streets of New York.Anyway, there is no way this movie deserves the 6.7 an the negative rep that it got, I honestly recommend watching it. The only thing that sucks is that a sequel was never made, but that had nothing to do with this film.","

"enazwo","16 June 2008","So often us guys have to endure going to romantic comedies, or date flicks so we can entice the lovely objects of our affection to continue to spend ""quality"" time with us. And more often then not it comes at an expense that goes beyond the mere dollar value of the excursion. That expense is having to tolerate some rather dubious plots, dialog and an ending you could see coming a mile away on your way to the movie theatre.Now for a guy a long comes ""The Incredible Hulk"", and it so lovely a date movie for guys. It has a beautiful intelligent girl, Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) who stands by her man. And no matter how angry and destructive he gets, no matter how unfashionable and tattered his clothes get, she stands by her man; Hulk that is, (Eddie Norton), and though he now only has a rain drenched cave for him to sleep in Betty stays by Hulk's side and even snuggles with him; and together they hold the cold, wet, and lonely dark night at bay.They wake to face hostile world together.I sincerely enjoyed this movie, and I am probably the only one who also enjoyed Ang Lee's thoughtful ""Hulk"". I think that is all right to enjoy both, though they are different interpretations, they both were quite satisfying to me....now if I could only find me a Betty Ross, and I wouldn't have to watch my temper, worry about my ragged clothes, or the dark lair I live in.","

"JohnDeSando","10 June 2008","""There are aspects of my personality that I can't control. And when I lose control, it's very dangerous to be around me."" Bruce Banner It's instructive to end the Incredible Hulk with the appearance of Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) foreshadowing the reunion of Marvel superheroes in a few years and showing how limited Hulk as character is next to the complicated, interesting Iron Man. Where Hulk has to worry only about expunging his deadly radiation poisoning (that inflates his body to Kong size when he's angry), Iron Man runs an arms industry that helps defend the greatest society in the world but spawns enemies who use his own weapons against him,.It's no Iron Man, but the Incredible Hulk will keep your adolescent boys' attention if they will stay for the hour or so of back story and set up. Maybe the lack of complicated character in Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) makes me long for Robert Downey, Jr.'s conflicted Iron Man; at any rate plenty of CGI fighting goes on here with few of the distractions along the psychoanalytical route there were for Iron Man.Banner needs an antidote for his uncontrollable anger, which thrusts him into a Kong-sized dilemma as he contends not only with a monster just like him (Tim Roth), but also a love for Dr. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) that has him engage in some Kong-like rescue for her, climbing buildings--you know the drill.Meanwhile, the consummate meany is General Ross (William Hurt), who wants more Hulks while Hulk would like to annihilate them, even his irascible self if the death could be arranged. If not, Hulk will return another day, but I won't be waiting for him: I have enough angry ex-wives who are more fearsome and more entertaining than this CGI-heavy, personality-light superhero.","

"darlybrito","29 June 2008","I got so mad when I went to see this movie on opening weekend because a blackout came and ruin everything. I left the movie probably half way and I was irritated. There was no way that the movie will start immediately so everybody left and obviously with their refund. The theater was close for a few hours so I knew I had to come the next weekend. Then comes next weekend and I still had in mine that I was going to watch about 30 minutes into the movie again, but I didn't care, it was a great 30 minutes.I was hoping this hulk movie to be more action-packed than Ang Lee's The Hulk. I wanted a true hulk movie and close enough towards its comic book. That's what the original didn't have and that's what The Incredible Hulk has.The Incredible Hulk brings a new everything to the big screen; cast, director, story, etc. This time, Edward Norton (Bruce Banner) is in South America (Brazil) trying to find a cure for the gamma radiation that destroyed his cells and turns him into a totally different person when he is irritated and angry. Meanwhile, William Hurt (General Thunderbolt Ross) is on Banner's tail when he finds out that Banner is in Brazil. All hell breaks lose when Thunderbolt Ross brings a pack of U.S. soldiers to capture Banner. Things then get even uglier when a new powerful monster known as The Abomination causes chaos on anybody who steps on his way.I really like the beginning of the movie because it was short and sweet to the point. It explains the events that happened in Bruce Banner's lab incident in seconds. Unlike Ang Lee's The Hulk when it probably took 30 or more minutes to explain the whole thing.The new cast did an amazing job in the movie, especially Edward Norton. He did a great as Bruce Banner. Before, I was not sure if this was the right choice, but now I'm definitely sure it was. I also thought Liv Tyler gave a good performance as Betty Ross. She gave a solid performance as I expected. Tim Roth and William Hurt did their job too. Roth did great as Emil Blonsky.Besides the story and acting, I thought the action and special effects were incredible. The action sequences between the hulk and military were amazing, but the final battle was so damn fun and great to watch. I totally think the Abomination and hulk fight should win an award for best fight.Overall, The Incredible Hulk is one of the best superhero movies of all-time and I'm sure hulk fans will not be disappointed.","

"slowcando","15 November 2023","Oh dear...I wrote an enthusiastic intro to how I'm going through the Infinity Saga for the first time in my Iron Man 1 review, how that good start put me in the mood for the rest......and a big stumble only at the second hurdle!This Hulk film is plain rubbish, for several reasons (note: IMDB's auto-formatting doesn't allow listing without line breaks):ineffective annoying shakycam.clumsy editing.no flow, odd pacing.uninteresting characters.phoned-in performances from actors we know are otherwise quality.weird incoherent intro, makes the origin story a mess.cliché military motivations.two-dimensional antagonist.dated cartoony CGI looks like Playstation cut-scenes.general dour depressive vibe.attempts at humour miss the mark.dialogue poor throughout. Unconvincing science fiction.stupid ending......that ending where they all just leave this giant powerful out-of-control monster who just destroyed a city (Abomination) lying still conscious on the floor means the viewer is meant to assume a few humans will...what? Arrest it?Tony Stark's 1-minute cameo really highlighted how dull all the other characters were: Downey Jr's snappy charismatic delivery sells the narrative immediately, while in the previous two hours the others all struggled.I gather this Hulk film is the black sheep of the Infinity Saga...and I have to agree. It's just not worth watching. However it gets a couple of points for some striking shots of the Rocinha favela, and a nice scene involving Hulk and his girlfriend in a cave. I'm not sure when or how Mark Ruffalo's Hulk takes over, so it's not entirely clear to me yet if a completist should struggle through this movie just to get an idea of Hulk's place in the saga.Next stop...Iron Man 2. Let's hope things pick up again.","

"dead47548","13 June 2008","The Incredible Hulk takes a slightly different approach to the normal routine of a superhero picture. Instead of focusing all the energy and screen time on trying to one-up the competition with the next best CGI sequence and the most explosive, ridiculous fight scenes, it takes a smaller approach and focuses on the characters. And it really works.Edward Norton's performance is easily one of the best in a film of it's nature, as he perfectly displays the internal anguish of a man who can't lose control of his emotions. Early on he encounters a female co-worker (he's living in Brazil at the time, working at a soda-producing factory) being harassed by some other men and you can see in his eyes the heartache that comes with knowing that by getting involved in the situation he'll only make things much worse. His performance goes far beyond what the role calls for and adds another impressive entry to his phenomenal resume. On the other side of the battle is an equally impressive from the always incredible Tim Roth. His Emil Blonsky is a soldier who believes his only reason for living is to fight. He's hitting middle age and realizing that his body is not at all what it used to be, so when he sees this massive green symbol of pure power he sees a new hope. Blonsky wants to the power of the Hulk, and he wants more of it. Roth perfectly captures the greed, obsession and slight desperation of Blonsky and seeing the two of them on opposite sides of a battle is absolutely stunning. William Hurt provides excellent support as the explosive Thunderbolt Ross, a General leading the hunt for Hulk and also father to Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), the love of Banner's life. In fact the only major flaw in the film is Tyler's atrocious performance. She is unconvincing, bland and sticks out like a sore thumb in this epic ensemble.On the surface, it's a chase film. Banner is in Brazil trying to find a cure for his gamma radiation poisoning, when General Ross finds him and the chase begins, ultimately resulting in one of the most adrenaline-fueled scenes in history when the army tries to bring Hulk down outside of the college where Betty works. So the chase aspect provides for absolutely incredible action sequences that had me on the edge of my seat throughout. But deep down, at the film's core is both a story of two lovers trying to be together and, more importantly, a story of a desperate man gaining control of his emotions and the explosive anger radiating inside of him. It makes for something very compelling, well-acted, explosive and well...incredible.","

"hannah8700-1","13 June 2008","Well, somebody finally got it right this time! This new version of ""The Incredible Hulk"" is exactly what the first one failed to accomplish. Everything about the movie made it great- the acting, the plot, the story line, and its evil, yet very worthy opponent. It's exciting, entertaining, action-packed and suspenseful and keeps you right on the edge of your seat the entire time. Edward Norton did a fantastic job as ""Mr. Green"" and met everyone's expectations. The fact that he helped write the screenplay for the film says a lot about his talents and abilities as an actor as well. Liv Tyler delivered a good performance too and together they both added a great deal more to the film. Her character is compassionate and kind which I found to make Norton's character more human. And the little bit of romance they had on the side too wasn't a bad idea either. Every great comic book hero has to have his girl, that damsel in distress that requires rescuing from time to time. And I was surprised to find that some lines Norton delivered in the movie were actually quite humorous and that's always a plus. The last battle sequence between the Hulk and the ""Abomination"" was awesome. The ending leaves the story line wide open for a sequel with a special appearance from Tony Starks, the Iron Man. It was really neat to see how they tied the two Marvel characters together in what promises to be another great movie in the making. I am anxiously awaiting the next film. So even though you may be wary of this remake give the new ""Incredible Hulk"" a chance. It won't disappoint you!","

"mvpax-2","27 July 2008","I entered the cinema without great expectations. I have to say it's really better as the first one.I am not a great fan of Hulk (the comic etc.) but i think this move is more like the TV series and not so over""comiced"" like the first one.--------------------- CONTAIN S P O I L E R S-------------------------OK it has some shadows (turning off a kerosene fire with clapping into the hands LOOOOL i've laughed so loud at this moment) and as he stand in a fire with his girlfriend in his arms...sorry but there are more than 30° Celsius its not a tanning bed Jesus!!!No scratch nothing...OK to argument with realism in a comic based movie is not really necessary but some things are to funny and nothing i can blind out. whatever....Best part of the movie (that comes first into my mind) was the ""Pants buying"" scene. At last a man who think of it that he need Pants with bungee!! (2 points for this masterpiece) Always wearing a Jeans....Maaaaan you know if you change into Hulk normal pants are to small for you! ^^ For a boring evening this movie was good enough to watch it.","

"mindsclay","26 June 2008","I liked the first Hulk movie because it was the Hulk, a Marvel character that I was so familiar with as a child reading comic books, watching cheesy animations and watching the TV series. THIS Hulk movie is more like tha actually Incredible Hulk I know and closer to the series.The Hulk in this movie was like the actually comic book character where he actually speaks and comprehends. The first Hulk movie showed him as a mindless brute. Also the first movie put too much emphassis on a relationship between Bruce Banner and his father David. And the new (original?) Hulk has more emotion.Choosing Edward Norton as Bruce Banner was perfect. Besides Norton's acting, his small frame helped create the contrast between Bruce and the Hulk alter ego.There are a couple of cameos and some winks to the fans. Can't tell you what those are, that would be a spoiler. :) This movie had great live action/CG mix with camera pans that were flawless increasing the effectiveness of the illusion.The true Incredible Hulk or Marvel fan will love this movie.","

"kurciasbezdalas","7 October 2008","What I enjoyed the most from this film was a fight between two monsters. Special effects wasn't very realistic but still it looked great. What else did I liked was Tim Roth's character but he somehow too often did a wrong decisions, like when Hulk crashed two cars, he come near him and asked if that's the best he can do and of course he was struck down by Hulk. Edward Norton also did a great job. What else did I like was Tim Blake Nelson's acting, I've seen him in some other movies but I newer noticed what a great actor he is. This movie is well filmed and the soundtrack somehow reminded me of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. There were few boring moments but still this movie is highly entertaining.","

"SlackerRus2000","16 June 2008","I don't know too much about the hulk mythos, but I can easily see why he is so well regarded. I anguish of not being able to control your actions when angered and the subsequent consequences of said actions, is easy to identify with emotion that most people suffer with. The 2003 film languished too much on this and forgot that it is ultimately an action film. This film seems to ride the thin line between action and emotion, between fist fights and questions of morality.The emotion is anchored by a strong cast. William hurt, Liv Tyler, and Edward Norton all provide strong performances even mention goes to lesser roles like Betty's boyfriend and Mr. Blue. The script is the biggest factor in creating the emotional connection between audience and film. I was startled by some scenes of blood and broken bodies showing the true extent of hulks power and the mental anguish Bruce has to deal with knowing he is the cause of it all. Scenes of anger and compassion are pervasive in the film. While the hulk is a beast of volcanic and temperamental emotion, deep down inside he is old Brucie after all and the film is smart to show that ultimately the hulk is a good guy. There are several scenes were the hulk is roaring, flexing his muscles, and all I could think about was the torment that is raging inside him. An action film that can make you think about the character and not the next action sequence is something special in deed.Oh, but the action sequences are not to be missed. I personally feel it is important for an action film to have a brisk pace and the hulk even though being a 2 hour movie never feels slow or plodding. The exposition is all interesting and the action sequences are top notch. The action isn't just top notch it incredible. The hulk looks magnificent, his animation and facial expression are dead on, and he loves to smash things. The amount CG damage done in this movie could bankrupt a large insurance agency. Oh, and this is one of the few movies I would recommend seeing in the theaters purely for the sound. Hearing the hulk roar in 5.1 Dolby digital in the theater was worth the price of admission alone.The one aspect I didn't particularly like in this film was its lack of humor. Call me crazy but I want a good one-liner every once and a while and the few they had in there just didn't stick with this moviegoer (though one moment when Bruce is falling from a helicopter is pretty funny). Also, I do think Iron man is a slightly better film which it is inevitable to compare two marvel films in the same summer. Still, this is one of the best comic book movies to date, a summer movie that should not be missed, and the beginning of a great franchise/ franchises (avengers anyone?)","

"joemamaohio","19 October 2008","Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is on the lamb in South America after what happened to him in the original film. He had to leave his old life behind - including girlfriend Betty (Liv Tyler) - behind in the States. But the government, led by General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), hasn't forgotten him. He enlists the help of Major Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to track Banner down, and they find him in a small South American town.Banner, who's been trying to research an antidote for his condition, has to turn into the Hulk again to escape and heads back home for a cure. Meanwhile, the government has been trying to replicate his DNA so they can create an army of supermen, and they use Blonsky as a test subject, and he becomes more and more evil, yearning for the power the Hulk has.Years after the disastrous ""Hulk"" movie, they decided to try it again, and this time it was a success! Gone is the lame animations of the first Hulk, and now we're treated with even better - even darker - Hulk CGI. No longer can he leap across states in a single bound, but he's more human-sized, with tremendous power. Norton portrays Banner in a great way, and the overall animation of the Hulk and his nemesis is 100 times better than the original.","

"WyteWolf","10 June 2008","While the storyline is predictable, I suspect that this flick (along with Iron Man) ushers in a new era of sorts for Marvel-based movies. While not as slick & witty as Iron Man, let's face it, the Hulk is not nearly as complex a character.I thought for a moment that perhaps this was the kind of flick I might dial up another friend to watch but I decided to take my wife which turned out to be a bonus for the both of us... I lucked out that I just so happened to take her to a movie that featured Portuguese (EN sub-titles on & off for about 10 minutes or so) but as it turns out she claimed to like it more than Iron Man (which I admit, I might have been a bit more partial to).Basic plot, good acting (on Norton's part), great special effects, and while I may have been more partial to Iron Man, the battles featured here cannot be compared.Keep 'em coming Marvel - great job!!","

"matthewbond007","22 June 2008","I've just came back after seeing the latest hulk movie hoping it would be much better than the last but still loyal to the comic book and the TV series.It was!!!!!! This is why.1.The cast were brilliant Ed Norton made the role his own and even looked similar to Bixby especially the green eyes bit. The supporting cast was just as superb. The only negative bit was not seeing Jack Mcghee. But he did get mentioned.2. The special effects were superb and making the hulk a more realistic size and strength rather than a light coloured green blob that is taller than the empire state building and can jump from city to city.3.Lou Ferringo did the voice of the hulk which I think was fantastic because lets face it he is the hulk. It was also great to see him in a different role and also Stan Lee appearing in another cameo.4. The depressing piano music was used albeit only for a minute or two. It was a shame they didn't use it at the end that would have been quality.Overall it was fantastic I don't think any hulk fan can argue with it. I cant wait for the sequel!","

"joestank15","21 June 2008","The Incredible Hulk - A reboot of the franchise after the Abomination that was ""The Hulk"", Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) evades the military after a mixture of Super Soldier serum and gamma radiation turns him into the jolly Green Giant we all love.I didn't like the first movie, for several reasons. It was slow. It was boring. Nick Nolte's heinous over-acting, and Eric Bana's aversion to acting. Oh, and the Poodle. Did I mention the Poodle? Who hasn't? It's become synonymous with the Bat-nipples at this point. While Incredible Hulk is no Batman Begins to Batman and Robin, it stays truer to the roots of the character than it's predecessor, and acknowledges the TV show, a wise move.This film gives the fanbase a little more of what they expect and deserve from a movie about a monster that destroys property. There aren't the Banner-father issues that the first film had and didn't need. There're also more explosions, noise (Jesus is it loud), action, humor and movement. It unfortunately retreads a little too much familiar ground. I've seen the Hulk get chased by the military. I've already seen this love/hate triangle between Ross, Banner and Betty, though it's actually interesting here I read there's a scene where Bruce travels to the North pole and contemplates suicide. Now there's a scene I haven't seen before, and would like to see.The trouble with the Incredible Hulk is unless you're a very very creative writer, The Hulk is a rather two dimensional character. He gets angry and then smashes crap up. The only memorable villain he ever has was The Abomination because the other secret to The Hulk is that he's a better villain (it's taken most of the Marvel universe to bring him down at varying points) than a hero. I applaud Norton for his creativity and the depth he brings to Banner. He also adds vitality and intelligence, whilst Eric Bana was having difficulty grasping the American accent. Liv Tyler adds a sweet sadness to the romantic interest. She is Banner's only connection to humanity when he transforms. Tim Roth plays the heavy pretty well, though I caught him overacting blatantly a couple times. The effects are pretty good and I enjoyed the action sequences.It's unfortunate that the better Hulk movie should come out second (and behind Iron Man no less) which should be a lesson to Hollywood. Put your butts in gear and get it right the first time. Good, not ""Incredible"", The Incredible Hulk gets a B.","

"iguth","27 April 2019","The Incredible Hulk while not being a very MCU friendly movie is still a superhero movie. The plot makes sense. It follows Bruce Banner and his struggles with the US military, simple. Although he is later replaced, for the character written in this film Edward Norton is a great choice of actor. The CGI is okay but the way the Hulk is portrayed amidst the CGI is very dramatic. The movie gives the audience very little background on the character and how he arrived at the point he is starting the film. As a concise stand alone superhero film, it really is not too bad, the downside is it is lacking that special something to make it great, it really is quite bland.","

His quest to make things right is impeded by unexpected events.""The Incredible Hulk"" has a great finale, but a weak beginning. I find the first 50 minutes far too slow. There can be generous trimmings and still does not affect the plot. In addition, how does Hulk in Brazil suddenly end up in Guatemala is not explained. In fact, there have been quite a few instances like this, which makes the story less coherent. The ending fight is quite breathtaking, it makes me engaged and I wish the fight occupied longer screen time. ""The Incredible Hulk"" is good entertainment for the evening.","

"mattwaterhouse","30 June 2008","I hated the first Hulk effort with a passion. The franchise had bags of potential and it was never realised, even though the style was visually impressive the film had no substance. Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly were well cast but their characters were a bit two dimensional. All the other characters were poor.Thank heavens for take two. The focus was taken from the origins of the Hulk and more on the aftermath, which then takes the focus from the Hulk and onto Bruce Banner, which was the smartest move the director made, and there is no better actor for portraying the humanity of a character than Edward Norton. When I first saw that he was in the role I was excited at the prospect of the new dimension he would bring to Banner, and he is successful in so many ways. His portrayal, William Hurt's portrayal of The General and Tim Blake Nelson's portrayal of Samuel Sterns had so much depth that it was a joy to watch them all on screen. Liv Tyler did an admirable and surprising job of surpassing Jennifer Connelly, who was one of the better performers in the first attempt. Tim Roth was somewhat below par as the main baddie, but he did the job expected of him with gusto.In terms of visual effects, its pretty much whats expected of a superhero film. The major difference from the first attempt at Hulk is the departure from the comic-book visual style. The effects are much darker, and the Hulk looks much more menacing than he did before. The tributes to the old incarnations of Hulk are well done, with the ""You won't like me when I'm angry"" speech nicely referenced, and there is a neat cameo from Lou Ferignio, who provides this Hulk's voice.I was incredibly impressed by this movie. It realised all the potential that the franchise has and does almost everything right. This and Iron Man have set the bar for superhero movies and bringing them together in the Avengers film will surely be a winner.","

Also the acting was very convincing because Ed Norton seemed like a real character not someone who was abstract and hard to connect to. Liv Tyler and William Hurt were perfect casting choices and should be brought back for the next installment. Tim Roth wont go down as one of the best villains ever but he was a cut above. Roth never gets enough credit as a truly good character actor. What really did it for me was the awesome ending, it shows that the Avengers are truly coming and that the Iron Man and this new revamped Hulk will be here for awhile. This film was exhilarating, well-paced and convincingly acted. Great Stuff","

"RCWjr","22 June 2008","I enjoyed the Ang Lee directed ""The Hulk"", but I was not entertained by it. I am not sure if that makes sense, but that is the easiest way I can explain the first film and my like/dislike of it. In the end I think Lee went away from the basics of the character and of the fan expectations and it was not what a film called ""The Hulk"" should have been.Flash forward to 2008 and ""The Incredible Hulk"". This go around, with Marvel studios having a heavier hand in the production, most everything is done right. Instead of taking up loads of time exploring the ""why"" of Banner's transformation, Zak Penn's script handles the genesis of Banner's Gama radiation exposure during the opening credits. That sets up the story perfectly. Another aspect done right is Banner being portrayed as a man on the run. This is what most fans enjoyed and loved about the original series and lets face it, the movie version has to address the comic and TV version if it is going to succeed.Louis Leterrier brings a welcomed action sense to the film. Let's face it, we want to see Hulk smash things. We want to see Banner on the run for his life. All of this is brought together nicely by Leterrier.My one nitpick of the film is the transition from some scenes to the next. There has been a lot of rumors circulating of chunks being removed from the final cut and in places it shows.I was not keen on Edward Norton playing the role, yet 10mins into the film I was sold on him. He brings to the Banner role the same emotional struggle that Bill Bixby did with the TV character of David Banner. Liv Tyler is fantastic. Her scenes with the computer generated Hulk are light years ahead in emotion compared to those from the first film. Speaking of the CGI, all in all it is much improved from the first film. Tim Roth as Abomination is perfectly cast, he brings an absolute evil glee to the table. William Hurt does some of his best work of late as the ""General"".There are ample cameos from the creator of The Hulk to the members of the TV series as well as a nod to another character in the Marvel universe.Much improved over the first movie, there was a lot of nay-sayers out there when this project was announced. But they proved them wrong and now the Hulk train has been righted and it looks like we will be seeing a lot more of him in the future.","

"rparham","27 November 2008","Marvel isn't one to let lackluster box-office and mixed reviews keep a good superhero franchise down. In the case of the the Hulk, one of their flagship characters, Ang Lee's 2003 film proved to not be the potent blockbuster they were after, so, five years later, Marvel has rebooted the character with The Incredible Hulk, featuring none of the cast or creative principals of the previous entry. So, what is the verdict of this do-over: a decent entry, featuring more action than the previous film, but not quite as deep in regards to character development.The Incredible Hulk opens with a title sequence that wipes the memories of the first film completely away, re-establishing the origin story, albeit in a more compressed form. The film proper then opens in Brazil, where Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is hiding from the government agents that are attempting to locate him. Bruce, it seems, has used himself as a guinea pig for a super-soldier serum, which, when his heart rate goes too high, leads to him transforming into a not-so-jolly green giant. While dodging the head of the super solider project, General Ross (William Hurt), Bruce is attempting to cure himself, with help from an unseen ally he communicates with over computer named Mr. Blue.After an accident at a soda bottling factory leads Ross to him, Bruce goes on the run, returning to the US and seeking out his lost love Betty (Liv Tyler), while being tracked by Ross's chief lieutenant, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), who has volunteered to also take some of the super soldier serum to attempt to beat the Hulk at his own game, but quickly becomes addicted to the serum, and leads to him seeking more and more, with possibly disastrous results.One thing was certain with this version of the Hulk, and that was that action, lacking in the first film, was to be more of a priority, and, for the most part, The Incredible Hulk delivers. There are no less than three major action sequences in the film, and each is reasonably well done, delivering decent thrills and energy. The Hulk, once again computer generated, is sufficiently convincing, a bit beefier and more muscular than the 2003 version.While the action has been ratcheted up, the attention to character detail has been scaled back a degree or so. The romance is there between Bruce and Betty in the script, but their chemistry is mostly dead. The friction between her and her father also rings a bit hollow, and the face off between Bruce and Blonsky is almost exclusively physical, with no deeper level to it. While those searching for more fisticuffs will be pleased, anyone interested in greater depth to the proceedings will find The Incredible Hulk a bit lacking.The Incredible Hulk boasts a strong cast, but they are used with mixed results. Edward Norton takes over the role of Bruce Banner from Eric Bana, but there is no real shift in quality. Norton delivers a good performance, but nothing exceptional. Liv Tyler is a step down from Jennifer Connolly's turn in the first film, not tremendously convincing as Betty. William Hurt doesn't give the best of performances as General Ross either, over the top in the wrong kind of way. Tim Roth gives another effective villainous turn as Emil Blonsky.The Incredible Hulk proves to be a good comic book film, but not pushing the envelope at all. Marvel has proved that they can turn a lackluster showing of a character around by starting over, but it remains to be seen if this incarnation of the Hulk will be back for a second round. If you are looking for some well-done comic book action and decent special effects, then The Incredible Hulk will deliver the goods. If you want a film that stretches the boundaries of the the comic book film, then look to Iron Man, The Dark Knight or Spider-Man 2.","

"richard-wilkinson-2","18 June 2008","There just aren't enough superlatives to describe the 2008 Incredible Hulk film. So I will try to break it down piece by piece : The casting of Edward Norton as Hulk/Bruce Banner was a curious one that stunned fans around the world, but trust me - he is perfect for the role. Norton plays Banner to a tee, giving the perfect representation of the awkward scientist - quiet, self-sacrificing, nervous and full of heart. From the first glimpse of Norton's eyes turning green the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end - the Hulk looks more like the comic book version than the Ang Lee one did. He appears smaller height-wise, but still massively proportioned. The musical score for the film reminded me of a cross between Batman and Spiderman. Epic scores for the action set pieces and dramatic scenes, and toning it down into dulcet, breathtaking pieces for the emotional parts giving the film the perfect balance between action and emotion. Liv Tyler is strong as Elizabeth Ross and gives the impression that she is ready to do anything for the man she loves regardless of his nature and appearance. William Hurt as Thunderbolt Ross was also a very good selection - he plays the part with a mean streak, leaving the viewer unsure of what to think of him. A special word must go out to Tim Roth as Blonsky/Abomination who gives a sterling performance of a man gone power mad. The Abomination itself is a fantastic creature - everything the Hulk is without possibly that small amount of self control. Finally, I need to give kudos to the last few scenes, the one with Tony Stark - who utters the words that make those hairs stand up again ""we'r putting together a group"" (Avengers :)) and the final scene with Norton staring at the camera meditating - then his eyes turn green and he smirks. This gives the impression that he can now control his power and could possibly lead Hulk to be the central antagonist in the Avengers film in 2011. All in all, 10 out of 10 for this tremendous comic book representation, I thoroughly enjoyed it and would watch it again and again.","

"ven2s","13 June 2008","This was a great homage to all the preceding HULKs, while maintaining its own originality! I was moved by a lot of the sensitive moments and the non stop action from beginning to end! Although I am one of the few that thought Ang Lee's take was also well done, this version makes that one pale in comparison. With great acting by Ed Norton, who captures the bittersweet struggle that Bill Bixby bought to the character, and excellent acting by William Hurt as the cold calculating General Ross; this movie has few misses. Liv Tyler does a great Betty Ross, but Jennifer Connelly would have been even better because she would have brought more emotional depth to the character.All in all, money well spent and not too violent for the kids, as long as you go with them. I sat with a bunch of teens and preteens and they were really engrossed in the action, although they missed some of the more poignant homages. If you enjoyed Iron Man, you will enjoy The Incredible HULK!","

"zetes","15 June 2008","A ""reboot"" of the series, following Ang Lee's disastrous (performance-wise) Hulk. I'm one of those who thought that film wasn't that bad. I'm not one who thinks it's great, either, but it was entertaining. I don't think The Incredible Hulk is any better, and I'd probably rank it a tad below Lee's film. This one is more action-oriented, although I honestly think the percentage of running time the action lasts is similar in both movies. The Incredible Hulk wraps its thin story around three giant action sequences, each better than the last. It's a lot of fun during those parts. Other parts, eh, not so much. It's fine, but it's the kind of movie where you keep thinking, ""Okay, blow something up already."" I still have the same major problem with this one that I did with the last one: CGI. Yeah, I'm beating a dead horse, if you're familiar with my point of view already. I especially don't think CGI works when the animated characters are supposed to be humanoid. When the Hulk is standing next to Liv Tyler, to me it's no more convincing an interaction than when Mary Poppins dances with cartoon penguins. I liked the nods to the TV series, including a hitchhiking scene, the sad piano music and a cameo by Lou Ferrigno.","

"FlashCallahan","3 October 2011","We find scientist Bruce Banner, living in shadows, scouring the planet for an antidote.But the warmongers who dream of abusing his powers won't leave him alone, nor will his need to be with the only woman he has ever loved, Betty Ross.Upon returning to civilisation, the brilliant doctor is ruthlessly pursued by The Abomination -- a nightmarish beast of pure adrenaline and aggression whose powers match The Hulk's own.A fight of comic-book proportions ensues as Banner must call upon the hero within to rescue New York City from total destruction.One scientist must make an agonising final choice -- accept a peaceful life as Bruce Banner or the creature he could permanently become...For a comic book movie, the film usurps the original by miles. Norton is great as the sympathetic character, and brings more life to the role than Bana did.The film is more focused om the action point of view, rather than Banners troubles, and it's to the films credit. Roth and Hurt are sublime as the Hulks potential captors, Hurt especially putting much more life into the role that Elliott did a good job with.Set pieces are stunning and the hulk himself is seamless. The final battle between Hulk and Abominationis spectacular and very exciting.The lack of chemistry between Nortonand Tyler is a bit of a letdown, as is the ending.When we see Hurt in the bar as he meets Stark, this feels that it should have happened after the end credits, it would have been more fitting to see Banner supposedly getting possessed by Loki and then then finish.Leterrier has done a fantastic job of recreating the hero, with lots of nods to the marvel universe and the history of the Hulk, it's the marvel film that isn't as prolific as the other Avenger spin offs, but one of the most fun.","

"colonel_green","14 June 2008","I just got back; all in all, I'd say pretty good. It's hard to compare it with Hulk '03 as to which is better, since they're very different types of films, but I'd say this definitely meets audience expectations a lot better.Edward Norton was good in the lead part, although, and perhaps this is a deliberate emphasizing of his need to control himself, he rarely seems to get very emotive, even when he's supposed to be really angry.Liv Tyler; I really like her as an actress, performance-wise here I'd say she's a bit weak in the first half and really good in the second. Admittedly, some of that could be that when we first meet her the director spends a bunch of time shooting her in slo-mo with a lot of shots of her looking uncertain/stunned. Starting with the big shootout at the university (""DAAAD!"") she won me over.Very effective use of humour; the interruptus scene in the motel room had the audience laughing hysterically.I think they overused the ""Betty calms the Hulk"" routine; I count at least three instances, possibly more.The villains, however, I didn't think much of, at least in human form. Tim Roth doesn't convey much menace as Blonsky; this is one instance where the CGI creature works a lot more than the actor (among other things, and I know this is something that can't be helped, he looks like a midget standing next to Ross (ie, pretty much all his scenes)). William Hurt as Ross wasn't nearly as good as Sam Elliot, though, to be fair, the character lacks the depth the first movie gave him. The biggest problem I have with Hurt's Ross, both in terms of writing and acting, is that there's really no sense that he gives a damn about Betty beyond one or two perfunctory expressions; the real conflict in Elliot's Ross made for a much more interesting dynamic.One problem with writing the Hulk and villains is that he inevitably faces them as the Hulk, rather than as Banner, and it's really, really hard to convey any continuity in what the Hulk's personality thinks from transformation to transformation, especially since his expressions in battle are always very simplistic. Lee's Hulk did a really good job of investing the conflict between Banner and the remade Absorbing Man with real weight (it just fell down in the physical aspect, which this movie delivered on).Great action; in terms of the finale, they outdid Iron Man in this respect; I think this is probably the best super-brawl that's yet been filmed in live-action, though (as Ebert pointed out in his review), the lack of any real relationship between Banner and Blonsky prior to the fight means it's mainly just a big fight.Excellent cameo by Stan the Man, which reminded me irresistibly of ""I Am Furious (Yellow)"".I give it an 8/10.","

"FeastMode","25 June 2019","AMAZING. I love this movie. The Hulk is a BEAST. Great overall movie with a great story, awesome action, INCREDIBLE musical score, and tons of beautiful shots. Multiple goosebumps scenes. Very moving love story. Three of his roars give me super chills every time. He is scary. I love Edward Norton as Bruce banner. I really wish they kept him in the subsequent movies. This is my favorite pre-Avengers MCU movie.EDIT: A few things I want to emphasize on 8th viewing. I don't know why, but the love story in this movie is one of my favorites across all genres. There are multiple scenes, significantly enhanced by the musical score, that just give me the feels.Speaking of the musical score, I adore it. One of my all-time favorites, again not specific to the superhero genre. The pianos and violins get me every time.And the action... even in 2023 after watching some incredible MCU action scenes, these scenes from the MCU's infancy still make my jaw drop. I love it.Even through four phases, The Incredible Hulk is still in my top seven MCU movies (maybe top five!!!). I'll never understand how it's considered bottom-tier MCU by most.(8 viewings, 4/14/2020, 4/13/2023)","

"Geeky Randy","17 March 2015","Wow. Who knew there would be so much eagerness to reboot the Hulk franchise only five years after Ang Lee's 2003 failure only to release an even bigger disaster. So now, after glossing over a new backstory in the lame opening credits, we have Edward Norton as Bruce Banner now, on the run while attempting to find a cure for himself before he is captured or before someone far less responsible than he obtains similar superpowers. While it should be embarrassing to reboot a story that was only done half a decade earlier, and that visual effects have not come all that far within that timeframe; what's worse than that and the lack of any other essential story elements is the simple fact that the plot does not MOVE. A mindless waste.* (out of four)","

"DonFishies","28 June 2008","Unlike most people, I really enjoyed Ang Lee's Hulk. Yeah, there was not nearly as much action as any other comic film at the time (or since), but the psychological undertaking that Lee envisioned for the character, to me, worked out quite well. It was boring at times, but it was a much more artistically driven attempt at a comic character that we probably will never see again.So enter The Incredible Hulk, a sequel/reimagining of sorts. The film picks up with Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) in Brazil, searching for a cure to his ""disease"". The American government are still searching for him of course, and he is still trying to stay as far away as he can from them.What is interesting about this film, is that if they had done away from the flashback sequences detailing how Banner became the Hulk, it could have easily been a flashier sequel to Lee's original film. But unfortunately (or fortunately for most), the basic skeleton of a storyline is just about the only thing that holds these two films in the same realm of contemporary comic film adaptations.As said, this film is incredibly (no pun intended) flashier than the original. There are three huge action sequences involving the Hulk himself, and at least two other sequences where the Hulk appears not fighting others. These lengthy actions scenes are fairly well filmed, and nearly flawless in their use of CGI. The Hulk interacts with his environments excellently, and there was very little by way of him looking fake (whereas Lee's film struggled in a few scenes to make him look real). Making him smaller is an obvious help to the creators, and clearly allows for better character interactions. I was actually genuinely impressed by the action set pieces, and marvelled at how far special effects have come since Lee's film (obviously, he does not need to be hidden in shadows throughout the majority of his appearances).What is also done well is how nostalgic the film feels. Yes, Lee had Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee show up, but that was about it. Here, director Louis Leterrier has added the two of them back into the mix, but as more than just small cameos. They actually have parts to play in the story, and Ferrigno even gets to voice the Hulk again. Not to mention the use of the theme song from the 1970's television series.But for anyone looking for any sort of exposition, they may be in for a bit of a disappointment.The story is interesting (about as much as a film that is primarily dictated by being an extended chase can be), and not just a typical sequel story. But it never delves into anyone's motivations for their actions. There is never a real reason why Banner wants to be cured, other than to lead a normal life. No reason for Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) to get Banner back to the US, other than to retrieve what he believes to be ""government property"". No reason for Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to go to the extremes he does, other than to take out the Hulk. It just seems all very one-dimensionally based, and any interactions just seem to be placed to move the film from one action piece to the next. Hell, as amazing as the actions scenes are, they seem extended simply to avoid having the characters engage in any development (outside of dropping obvious things that people who already know something about the Hulk would know).For all the controversy leading up to the film's release, even to the naked eye, it looks like Norton is being held back in lieu of his green CGI counterpart. He never gets a real attempt to chew scenery, and never looks comfortable in any of his scenes. His brilliant repertoire of films suggest that he would have truly made something of this role, but it looks like it was either cut out, or he just failed to take the time to even try. Any character building scenes he has (especially when interacting with Liv Tyler's Betty Ross) are either cut short, or begin and end faster than they started. I will say that his emotions and body language do a lot for his character, but unfortunately, not nearly enough to make this role be on par with anything he has ever done in the past.The supporting cast is much the same. Roth really makes at attempt at making Blonsky to truly feel villainous, but he just seems too over-the-top to make it seem like anything other than a villain straight from the pages of a Hulk comic. I liked him in the role, but he too could have done with a bit more backstory and motivations for his later actions. Hurt is great as always, but only because he has very little to do with the material he is given. His obvious relationship (or lack thereof) with Tyler's character is almost entirely missing and we never truly understand his actions outside of their obviousness. Tyler is almost entirely devoid of anything to make her character feel worthwhile at all, and Tim Blake Nelson's character feels tacked on as a mere indication of a sequel.It may sound like I hated the film, but it was so much more enjoyable than I imagined it would be. Leterrier had a huge undertaking to make his film feel completely different than Lee's, and whether I like his alternate vision or not, it cannot be said that he did not do a hell of a job making it come to life. It does not help that the film merely feels like a piece in the grand scheme of Marvel's attempts to bring an Avengers movie to life, but the film merely makes the most of what it was given. And it only could have been better if it was given more.7/10.","

"adamsmith-51004","15 April 2021","I really enjoyed this movie. This is the version of the Incredible Hulk that I wish they had kept throughout the MCU. That's not a slight on Mark Ruffalo, his version of the Hulk is good and more ""fun"", but when you compare the two, CGI quality aside, this version of the Hulk is meaner, stronger and looks more like a monster. The story is pretty straight forward and basic and the pacing is a bit slow as they explore character relationships but the action sequences are well done and you really do get a sense of the Hulks strength. There's also a little bit of humour, but it's subtle like when Bruce explains to Betty that he needs to remain calm at all times and then the very next scene they are taking a New York cab across town and his heart starts beating uncontrollably as they weave in and out of traffic. It's kind of funny to think that Banner could turn into the Hulk because of a taxi ride when usually it's from being beaten up or seeing his friends hurt! I also wish the MCU would revisit some of the plots established in this film because there is clearly a scene setting up the emergence of one of Hulk's greatest foes, The Leader, but it's never been mentioned again in other films that I'm aware of... Edward Norton played the role of Bruce Banner well I thought but the standout in this film for me was William Hurt as General Thunderbolt Ross. He did a fantastic job and no wonder he stayed on to continue portraying the character in the MCU. My favourite scene was the end fight between Abomination and Hulk, the actual end of the fight itself was a little bit of a let down but the lead up to it and the back and forward feats of strength were fun to watch.It's not the greatest film in the MCU but it's much better than some critic reviews lead you to believe. It doesn't really play too much of a role in the MCU anymore as you can easily bypass it and still understand and enjoy every other film in the franchise. In saying that, I reccomend this film to all superhero or comic book fans as it's a great interpretation of the Incredible Hulk with some decent action.","

"skatman44","16 June 2008","Chances are if you are looking at ratings or comments of the release of the The Incredible Hulk then you have seen the film or are thinking about it. Well if you are the later then spend the eight or nine bucks on the ticket to go see it, it will be well worth it.I had heard many reasons of why some people did not want to go see this film and many of them reverted back to the 2003 film The Hulk, I unlike what seems to be many other people have this film and enjoyed seeing it many times. I do understand though that many people were not impressed with fight scene time or with the C.G. of the time but overall I still think it is a decent way to spend a rainy night.If you had some concerns about The Incredible Hulk based on some let down after viewing the 2003 film, DON""T! The fight scenes are longer, the Hulk looks more realistic, and he is still a bad ass. Marvel in my opinion is 2-for-2 this summer and that is what they are going to need going up against the July 18th release of The Dark Knight by D.C.","

"roddickrocker21","22 July 2008","This has been a summer of superhero flicks. Ironman, Hancock, Incredible Hulk, The Dark Knight and Hellboy II have all topped the box office and all in all, none of them were really bad (I have yet to see Hellboy, though). The Incredible Hulk is no exception.The Incredible Hulk starts off with about a five minute background story during opening credits, just to quickly tell the origin of the character. If you don't already know, Bruce Banner was experimenting with radiation, he gets exposed, and now whenever he gets angry (or excited) he turns into this big green monster known as the Hulk.If you compare this reboot to its 2003 predecessor, you'll be able to clearly see the good things this film did. Ed Norton, playing Bruce Banner, is a great actor, and he puts on a great performance. The film is also extremely well paced; you should never get bored, because the action scenes (about 3 big ones) are so well balanced and spread out. Liv Tyler, playing Banner's love interest Betty Ross, does an alright job but it doesn't really take away from the movie. I'll just say that the whole beginning of the movie, where Bruce Banner is on the run from U.S. forces and trying to find a cure for his problem, is probably the best part, but the movie stays pretty decent throughout.The worst aspect of the film is likely the dialouge. The was (mostly) written by Zak Penn, known for the last two X-Men movies and Behind Enemy Lines. I'm not going to say he's a terrible writer, but he's got a lot to learn about dialouge. Particularity during fight scenes; characters constantly exchanging silly taunts that take away from the action. The Hulk talks, and it sounds god awful.All in all, this film is very much worth watching. Great visual effects, including the coolest helicopter crash I've seen in awhile on film, good acting and great story progression. If you're looking for a very good action and superhero film, this is it.","

"jonnydmullan","5 April 2020","The Incredible Hulk is the black mark in the MCU that we don't like, but I'm going to.This film reaches new levels of terrible. The CGI is abysmal and the acting is at best awkward and at worst blatantly robotic. And I know this movie is 12 years old and that CGI has come a long way since then, but Iron Man puts this movie to shame. And The Incredible Hulk had a bigger budget.The amount of action in this movie is overwhelming. Like I criticised Iron Man for not having enough, but The Incredible Hulk goes too far the other way with action scenes lasting far too long and occurring far to frequently. Furthermore, I thought the lighting made it hard to see what was going on and the staging of the scenes was over massive areas that we couldn't actually tell what was happening.And finally, I cannot fathom why the ""villain"" was designed to look so similar to Hulk. I found myself having to struggle to work out who was punching whom and who was dragging whom.The Incredible Hulk is about two hours too long and I hate it purely for it being the reason we haven't got a Hulk movie since.","

"alanrayford","8 December 2008","The summer of 2008 was the season of the superhero at the box office. There was Iron Man, Hancock, Hellboy II, Wanted, and the Dark Knight. However, as impressive as each of these films are, one stands above them. That movie is the Incredible Hulk. However, marred by a highly questionable 2003 entry, it didn't do too well at the ticket booth. Now I hear talk of there not being a sequel to this truly superior film. How very sad.The Incredible Hulk is an action packed film that, literally, delivers the comic book to the big and small screen. When Banner hulks out in Brazil, the heavily armed and highly trained operatives chasing him were put in a very dangerous predicament. He's kicking around industrial mixing tanks and hi-lo's like they're nothing, and the gunmen were taken down to the last person without the Hulk putting any thought into anything besides getting out of that factory. Later, the Army finds Banner and a proper fight ensues. In this scene we have hummer's, tons of soldiers, APC's, a gunship, and two sonic bombardment cannons. Two words sum this scene upHulk smash. We see Banner's alter tear through all of this equipment like a bull in a China shop. It was just like a comic, but with one difference. In this scene we got to see the Hulk cut loose on a pre-Abomination Emil Blonsky. When that idiot was kicked through the air, only to have his body crushed and bloodied against the trunk of a tree, I knew the ante had been upped.All of this action of course builds up to the final showdown between the Hulk and the Abomination. In the Dark Knight, Hancock, and Iron Man, the final showdowns were mildly anticlimactic. In the Incredible Hulk, this conflict was more than worthy of the time spent leading up to it. Maybe it was the Hulk turning a cop car into boxing gloves. It could have been him extinguishing a gasoline fire by clapping his hands together. There's always the chance it was the Hulk causing a localized earthquake by stomping his feet on the groundright after yelling out Hulk smash!! For whatever reason, this fight between these two inhuman behemoths is the fight. It's like the big budget, sci-fi equivalent of Martin Riggs vs. Mr. Joshua or, even better, the fight scene in the Bourne Ultimatum. It is brutal, unflinching, awesome, and not to be missed.But, it's not all smashing. There is a tightly scripted story here as well. This movie eschews the tone of the inferior 2003 production and cuts right to the heart of the matter. Bruce Banner is a scientist, on the run from the government, who has a problem. Seeing how he set up an impromptu lab in Brazil was pretty cool. Later, landing in Mexico after an episode, it was compelling to see him pick up the pieces of his life and soldier on. In a Hulk film, you're supposed to want to see the Hulk. The script for this movie, however, made me not want to see the green guy so much. This is because every time he reared his head, it held catastrophic results for Banner. The writing is so good that it actually made me care more about Bruce Banner than the Hulk. But what is writing without acting to back it up.Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, William Hurt, Tim Roth, and Tim Blake Nelson all delivered in their roles. Norton really sold Banner's horror over the fact that, if he goes over 200 BPM's, his world just stops and, the next day, he has to rebuild from scratch and live with the consequences of whatever he may have done. Liv Tyler made me believe Betty Ross' anguish over loving someone who was, for all practical purposes, cursed and inordinately dangerous to everyone and everything around him. Sam Elliot's General Ross was the one bright spot in the 2003 film. While William Hurt's take on the character doesn't look as badass, he really embodies the spirit of a man who is utterly obsessed with controlling a force of nature. Emil Blonksy, as portrayed by Tim Roth, is absolutely believable as an old soldier, teetering on obsolescence, who is willing to sell his soul for power. Tim Blake Nelson made the character of Samuel Stern fully his own, by imbuing him with a comical level of intellectual recklessness that flew in the face of all kinds of common sense. The real testament to the strength of this cast, though, was when Betty was helping a threadbare and twitchy Bruce around after an episode. There was no dialogue or anything to suggest what the movie was. However, if a person had been in a coma for the last ten years and didn't know this movie existed, they still would've known what they were looking at from that one image. The acting made what could've been a typical non-scene iconic.The F/X was a step up from the previous effort. The Hulk, while still the size of a house, was more in proportion. This made it so that his status as a CGI creation was not glaring. The same is to be said of the Abomination, who genuinely looked more imposing here than he did in the comics.The Incredible Hulk is, in my opinion, the breakout action film of the 2008 summer season. It didn't make the most money. It didn't receive the most acclaim. It didn't have the biggest budget. But, like its namesake suggests, it defies all of this to beincredible. I truly hope Marvel Films realizes they have a viable franchise now that the 2003 version is dead and buried under this leaner, smarter, and vastly superior reboot. Just get the DVD, and see if you can keep your mouth closed and your pulse under 200.","

There are some cerebral moments but when it's time to Hulk out... run for cover! With ""Iron Man"" and ""Incredible Hulk"" hitting box office gold, this is beginning to look like the golden age of super hero movies. This movie will leave your movie-going senses on high, just like a Hulk movie should.This film works because of the great cast and the fact that the director took this subject matter seriously. Casting a perennial Oscar contender like Ed Norton was perfect. Veteran's like William Hurt and Tim Roth really shine in their roles. What can you say about the stunningly beautiful Liv Tyler? She's just fabulous.Incredible Hulk was much, much better than I expected and much better then the last film. Spider-Man set a new standard for the superhero film genre but this movie ups the ante. I look forward to seeing it again and I hope it does well enough to be worthy of a sequel.

"ignus5uk","17 June 2008","When rumours of a new Hulk film began to surface after the Ang lee version, reservations set in the hearts of many of movie goers, however, when it emerged this was to be a reboot, curiosity began to grow and after setting foot out of the cinema having heard the words “Hulk smash”, any reservations about this film had indeed been smashed.With the remnants of Ang Lee’s 2003 Hulk still prevalent in people’s minds, Louis Leterrier’s take of ‘The Incredible Hulk’ draws influence from the 80’s TV serious, with nostalgic music pieces and recreated scenes. Since the creation of the hulk from gamma ray exposure was commonly know, rather than invest heavily in to an origin story, write Zak Penn condenses it down to a neat little montage incorporated into the opening credit to allow for the story to take full steam from a spectacular opening shot of the slums of Brazil. In his new fugitive life, genius scientist Bruce Banner, played by Edward Norton leads a solitary life seeking a cure and some control for seemingly incurable condition. All the while he is evading a US government search for him led by General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross and his new recruit Blonsky, a 39 year old unaccomplished soldier trying to make a name for himself wanting the power of Banner, which he inevitably gets to become Abomination.Taking influence from the Bourne films, ‘The Incredible Hulk’ opens with an edge of the seat chase through Rio leading to a brief opening glimpse of the Hulk and is an excellent setup to what continues as a well thought out film. When Hulk finally makes his full appearance on screen we can see that a much more generous input has gone into the CGI work. The actions sequences that follow will leave you in awe and the brute force, sumo style culminating fight will ultimately satisfy the child in you. Norton is excellent as Banner and able to bring a sense of desperation and inner torment to this role, but the film doesn’t really attempt to develop this or take the same risks to any level similar to what Ang Lee set out to do and we only see really see one side of Norton character. Liv Tyler as Elizabeth ‘Betty’ Ross, playing Banners empathetic love interest left a sweet feeling and gave an overall decent enough performance. Even with the obvious ‘bad guy’ stereotyping of Blonsky being Russian and British, the talents of Tim Roth still managed to come out of a one dimensional character.So, with Leterriers playing the right cards are there any faults? Well, asides some unnecessary cameos and limited character exploration, ‘The Incredible Hulk’ manages to hit all the right buttons – it is a comic book adaptation done well with themes that not only make it work on screen but allows your average view to get involved with the central character, if only slightly. With comic to films adaptations having no end in sight and the as we enter the new dawn of marvel films with darker themes and crossover universes ‘The Incredible Hulk’ manages to keep the bar raised high and is the best possible pit stop to the climax of the summer blockbuster...The Dark Knight.","

"Red_Identity","25 July 2011","The Incredible Hulk is definitely different in tone to the 2003 version of Ang Lee. I still cannot decide which is better. Neither are great films, but both are worth watching. The 2003 version is definitely the more ambitious, slower-paced, more character-centric film, but it has its flaws. The Incredible Hulk (2008 version) is more mindless (not a bad thing), more entertaining, and fits the tone of a comic book movie better, BUT it also has its flaws. I say that its easier to just pop in this version and watch, BUT I cannot help but feel that I do have more respect for what the filmmakers tried to do in the 2003 version. Anyways, this is worth watching as well, and it has a better Bruce Banner.","

"pgtc","20 September 2008","I have to admit I've never been much of an Ang Lee fan, but this pathetic B-movie disaster just pales in comparison to Lee's film. To begin with, the plot (if it can be called that) is so shallow and full of holes that it's embarrassing to see respectable actors like Edward Norton and Tim Roth involved with this mess. An American military airplane heading towards Rio? Brazil is not Iraq. It would have been put down by the Brazilian Air Force in a minute. A vehicle with half a dozen armed guys in a Brazilian favela? The local drug bosses would have gladly used them as target practice. And the cream of the crop, a ""for export"" bottled juice factory INSIDE a favela? This will become the joke of the year in Brazil. As to the reviewer from Singapore who wrote ""(...)the crowded streets and cluttered housing on the streets of Rio De Janeiro(...)"" - for mercy's sake, get a clue and your geography right before writing this kind of nonsense. The scenes take place in a FAVELA, which are poor, isolated parts of the city, not the city itself.There are far FEWER action sequences than on Lee's film, and what there is is so pointless, badly executed and less exciting that the average popcorn eater above 6 years of age will be bored to death. Any self respecting fan of the Hulk comic books will rate this abomination of a movie as low as possible. I gave Ang Lee's film 9 stars, and this one gets 2 only because the CGI work on the Hulk is very well done, otherwise it would have gotten 1 star (since IMDb doesn't allow a 0 star rating).","

"pc95","22 July 2008","The Incredible Hulk starts it's story moving immediately assuming we already know the story lines which is mostly true. This is a good idea as there's a quick prelude and setup to the story. I enjoyed the first 20 min of it pretty well - good pacing, good action, decent acting, and wonderful locale of Brazil capped off with a great chase scene. However Liv Tyler is a poor casting choice and it becomes a problem once she enters the story. Her acting is somewhat vanilla and the romance between her character and Edward Norton's is really flat. Detractingly awful actually. What's worse is there's a good 20 min of it at least during the movie - too much emphasis on a weak link. She needs some better direction and work with the scenes alongside the Hulk CGI too - she looks like she's staring off in different places instead of the Hulk's face. Additionally William Hurt is pretty forgettable as supposedly a brass general as there's too much subdued in his actions and conversations to make him believable as a leader. Edward Norton gives a rather standard performance - not as good as some of his past movies but satisfactory. This new Hulk is lavish with effects, some pretty exciting action sequences, and the Green man looks pretty good more like the comic-book looks like the aim of it. Probably the best performance is by Tim Roth as sort of an over-zealous soldier owing to good writing in this instance. Anyway The Incredible Hulk is not as good as Iron Man (spoiler - if you've seen Iron Man you'll love the cameo.) needing more humor, but definitely better than the earlier recent Hulk by Ang Lee who failed in the look. This is a good effort unfortunately with some standout flaws, but worth a watch certainly. Effects get piled on almost gratuitously towards the end though.","

"ninja209-1","27 October 2008","I found this movie at blockbuster one day just thought id check it out. i didn't know what i was to expect in this movie. i've seen it at least 3 times now and i just got one word to describe this film, INCREDIBLE.it was right up there with iron man in my opinion. I loved this movie from the acting to the story to the action etc. It was pretty epic. Finally they have made the hulk the way it was supposed to be made. It just got right to the point unlike the previous hulk film by Ang Lee. It was just so boring but this one gets right to it. It starts out with Bruce Banner, he has been in hiding somewhere in Brazil for a good 6 months still trying to find a cure to get rid of the monster within him. It seems to be going pretty well until the military somehow found out where he has been hiding and hunted him down and it pretty much goes from there i guess. He makes his way back to the states, meets his old girlfriend, and so on. The scenes where he becomes the hulk are really worth it especially the final fight between him and abomination. There was a few things they took from the old TV show as well. ""The lonely man"" song was even put in there and i wasn't expecting that lol and other things. I really hope they consider making a sequel","

"CuriosityKilledShawn","12 February 2012","It wasn't a tall order to improve upon Ang Lee's disastrous 2003 effort, which was simply horrible in every way. Transporter director Louis Leterrier turns up the action, while maintaining a light touch without compromising the drama. But, like Iron Man released earlier that summer, it's utterly brainless entertainment with no lasting merit whatsoever.Bruce Banner (now more appropriately played by Edward Norton instead of Eric Banana) is living in South America, away from the authorities who want to turn his curse into a weapon. Over-confident Army soldier Emil Blonsky (a very small, old, and un-threatening Tim Roth) wants a shot at capturing the Hulk, but gets smashed in the process. He is quickly repaired with a magic potion and turns into The Abomination, a creature even more fake than the big, green CGI guy.Like other comic-book movies that preceded it, the ending is nothing but two CGI effects thumping each other until one of them doesn't get back up, while the surrounding environment is destroyed for our 'enjoyment'. I am honestly sick to death of this. The Punisher, with Thomas Jane, kept it real and gritty and it flopped. But CGI trash like Spider-Man, Iron Man, Hulk and Fantastic Four make hundreds of millions. It doesn't make sense to me.Personally, I feel that comic-books are more suited to TV where the characters and plots can be developed over long periods of time instead of rushing through everything with generic, tired motivations in 110 minutes. While this movie is not bad, even the 1978 TV show was better. It sets up a lot for the long-in-development Avengers movie, which is so low on my priorities list it's completely subterranean, including the creation of 'The Leader'. But I doubt we will ever see the character in any sequel, mid-quel, prequel, or spin-off. There's just too much material, and not enough time to fully explore everything.The Incredible Hulk is an inoffensive time-waster. Don't go out of your way for it.","

"kyle-mcdonald","13 June 2008","Well at first I didn't want to see this movie at all because when I first heard that Edward Norton was playing Bruce banner I thought that he would not do a good job at all. Then I saw what the first look of the hulk was and I thought it wasn't very good. Then I saw the trailer and I thought that it looked stupid and the hulk looked to fake. But then I read some of the early reviews and it kind of changed my mind so I said I will give a crack at it and see what it is like and boy was I surprised. It turned out this movie is actually really good because it turns out that Edward Norton does a pretty good job as Bruce banner/Hulk, and not only that all the rest of the actors do a great job as well. The storyline turned out to be very good and very interesting. The special effects turned out to be great I don't understand why it looks more realistic in the theatres maybe because all of the special effects were not done when the trailer came out maybe. The way the hulk looks in the movie is very well done and it is cool that they got Lou ferrigno to do the voice of the hulk. The abomination is very well done also. The fight and action sequences are very good and well done especially the final fight scene. So this is really good and you should go see it. So make sure that you rent or buy the incredible hulk because it is really good.Overall rating: ********** out of ********** ***** out of *****","

"eamon-hennedy","19 July 2009","You see, here's my problem, Ang Lee's Hulk was, to all intents and purposes, a noble film, very noble in fact. The man responsible for bringing one of the definitive Jane Austen adaptations to our screens as well as one of modern cinema's great martial arts epics, not to mention The Ice Storm, took it upon himself to art up, for lack of a better term, I do apologise, I'm sure I could have come up with something better, a property that consists of a man turning into a green monster who says 'Hulk smash' pretty much most of the time. It was noble, of course it was, layering in a foundation that took in split screen editing, that worked, and a complicated relationship with his father and a brooding atmosphere, it was just the film was turning the character and story into something it wasn't, which is why I think bringing in Louis Louterrier and essentially broadening the whole style of the film is a good move, and let's not beat around the bush, The Incredible Hulk, as opposed to Ang Lee's Hulk is a broader movie in every way. The film is not as inherently complex as the previous, the action is more frequent and a hell of lot more fun and more clear to see most of the time and the relationship between Betty and Bruce is a lot more romantic, with a lovely comedic element becoming a lot more engaging. In fact the whole film is engaging in every way that Lee's isn't. Edward Norton, an actor for fairly intense performances, brings that element, but also fun, to his performance and his uncredited work on the screenplay. He plays the more light hearted moments (stretchy pants, anyone, or inability to make love with Betty) beautifully, making his Banner quite a lovely character and you can't help but feel sympathetic to his plight. Liv Tyler is lovely throughout, but that's really all she brings to the table, but let's not get carried away, she does it well, whilst the villains, William Hurt and Tim Roth are fantastic, particularly Roth who literally becomes a worse character than the one he is chasing.There are those who will undoubtedly bemoan that the film is dumbed down compared to Ang Lee's version, but to be honest with you, I think the film works best because of it. It may be wrong to refer to it as being dumbed down, I think calling it a broader film works better. The action is more elaborate and high octane, the CGI is miles better than before, with the Hulk himself looking less like Shrek's angrier twin brother and more like a flesh and blood creation. It's hair blowing in the wind and the vain's pumping through its green skin is a wonderful piece of visual effects work and the believability of it makes the film easier to enjoy, a major flaw of the previous version. If there is a criticism to level at it it has to be with the climax. The fight sequence between the Hulk and the Abomination starts of well, but does go on a bit long and at times, with all the CGI going starts to resemble a video game. It's the only fault with the movie, but not a glaring one, and when it's the only fault I am finding as compared to the many that film number one had, it's not bad going, and of course, as with all comic book adaptations nowadays, the ending only leaves you gagging for more. That is a great final shot.Hulk, you are incredible again.","

"Matt_Layden","3 July 2008","After testing an upcoming project on himself, Dr. Bruce Banner becomes a giant green monster, known as The Hulk. The father of his girlfriend is a general who wants to capture the creature and create an army of these monsters.After The Hulk disappointed fans in 2003 because there wasn't even 'Hulk Smash', the people in suits decided to give it another go, this time less talk and more walk. This time there were changes all around. New director, new leads and a new HULK all together. This time we have a more gritty and mean hulk, yet at the same time it has that campy feel that throws back to the old TV show. While the new version is better then what Lee gave us a few years back, it still isn't an eye popper.Out is Bana and in is Norton. A stronger actor, yet he is in unfamiliar territory. Norton is not really a blockbuster star, which begged the question ""Are they really going to make a blockbuster Hulk, or another artistic piece"". Norton brings more depth to the character, yet with the ongoing drama that plagued the film it is hard to tell what more he wanted to do with the character. William Hurt replaces Sam Elliott as the General, he chews the scenery he's in and plays up the comic book bad guy role very well. Finally Liv Tyler steps in for Jennifer Connelly, much like the last film that character isn't given too much to do except cry for Banner. Tim Roth makes his way into this film playing a bad guy yet again. He isn't given much to do here either and the reason behind him becoming what he becomes is a bit eye rolling.Another problem the first film had was that the Hulk itself was too fake looking. This time they tried to ground this beast in reality a bit more, yet it still feels out of place. He is less green and a tad bigger I believe. While I still am not a big fan of this character he works better here. The Hulk finally sees his match here with the villain and no he does not battle with rabid overgrown dogs. The fight between these two beasts is action packed as they tear up the city (half of which was filmed in my hometown).As decent as this film is it doesn't leave a lasting memory. It's a loud and fast paced action film, which is exactly what it should be. It will please those who might have wanted more from the first one, which took itself way too seriously. There's fun to be had here, watching a giant Hulk destroy army vehicles will please action junkies. But we are now on a high lever for comic book films. No longer can you just make a decent comic book film, you need to wow the audience and leave a lasting impression. The Incredible Hulk doesn't do this. You walk in, enjoy the two hours and then leave and don't really talk about it anymore.","

"RaspberryWaffles","15 June 2008","Remember Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk? Well we can all forget that film now. This movie sure hit the spot for a Friday night. First of all, Norton pretty much dominates any role he is in, after all; he was a crazy Nazi turned goodie in American History X, a schizo in Fight Club, and a complete psycho in Primal Fear. He fills his role as Bruce Banner with complete control over the part. William Hurt has been one of my favorite actors ever since I saw A History Of Violence, and he keeps me entertained in this movie. Liv Tyler at times seems a lil bit too emotional, but believable just that same. I've heard some people on IMDb bash Tim Roth for his part in this film, but I don't see why. Some say he was supposed to be an insano nutcase in this movie. I loved his part and his subtle cruelty and demeanor. To me, he is not the perfect Emile Blonsky, but he sure is close to the best.The action scenes in this movie aren't held back or exaggerated. Not like in Transformers when there was so much going on you couldn't see anything. This movie honed in on everything without crowding the shots. One of my favorite parts about this movie is that the Hulk is mean looking. I hated the Ang Lee Hulk because he was really smooth like and comic-book looking. This Hulk is mean green, with veins popping and ripped muscles showing, with some cool hair and an awesome ROAR!. The Abomination was well done too, but I don't want to give much away about him. Another little thing that I noticed that I really liked was, when the Hulk or the Abomination run, it looks as though its actually just somebody running, its so damn real.No real spoilers in here, and I have nothing to bash about this film. Well actually I do, I don't like Mr.Blue. His cocky, ignorant, comical behavior is not suited for this movie, which in a way relates to Batman Begins with its more serious mood. Seven out of ten stars for a great job by the cast and crew, lets hope the sequel kicks ass. One last thing, don't stay after the credits, there is nothing there.","

But then the new Dr. Banner grows on you from ""The Avengers"" still the story can be connected through Dr. Blue as he was turning into some kind of Big Brainac monster. Which can lead up to a new villain. Movie's overall tone is serious. But Hulk CGI is amazing, not so much of the abomination.

"tomok97","2 July 2008","Let's start with answering the most pressing questionNo, the Hulk doesn't fight roided out poodles in this one.If you liked Ang Lee's take on the Hulk back in 2003 (ahhhhyou're the one) then you won't be happy with The Incredible Hulk. For the rest of us, you're in for a treat. A reboot of a franchise this new is unprecedented but it was worth the risk. Think of it as a $100 million first draft.It's rough for Hulk, coming on the heels of Iron Man. Iron Man was the best comic book movie since Spiderman 2 and quite possibly since the first Superman movie. While this movie isn't the roller coaster ride that Iron Man was, it was a solid cringe-free adaptation.After a breezy retelling of the origin story, the movie opens with Bruce Banner on the run in Brazil. He's being hunted by the government - as governments are wont to do. Banner is in hiding as a day worker at a soda factory.Ed Norton brings a brooding intensity to Banner but it's far from the star turn that Tony Stark was for Robert Downey, Jr. However, that is more indicative of the character than it is of Norton. Tony Stark is a drunk (on alcohol and power), loopy mess that has fun with his abilities and status both as Stark and Iron Man. Conversely, for all of the Hulk's power, Banner has virtually none. He's hunted, broke and tired. Tony Stark looks for cool robot technology to build cool robot suits. Bruce Banner looks for stretchy pants. It can be hard to compete.Downey as Tony Stark is like Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow or Harrison Ford as Han Solo  a performance so instantly iconic that you can't imagine any other actor in the role. Norton does a good job but it never quite reaches that level. While some of that falls at the feet of the screenplay, he co-wrote it we so can blame him either way. (In his defense, he is unhappy with the final version of the movie and is refusing to do press in support of the film. There is allegedly a pending DVD release with a whopping 70 minutes of additional footage, so time will tell.) The movie is much more serious than recent comic book outings with the exception of The Batman franchise. Unlike most superheroes, Banner/Hulk is a threat to the public NOT it's savior. This has always been a hurdle for the comic book and it's the main reason the show ended up as a green-tinted version of The Fugitive.This movie definitely has more of the tone of '70s show but with less cheese and better effects. We get the footage of Banner ripping through his clothes and his eyes turning green as his inner-beast finally wins out. The score, while different, has the same sense of melancholy. And we get the same lingering shots of a lonely Banner walking dejectedly into the distance down an empty road.The movie is a little slow paced in the first half. I took my 8-year old son and he got a tad restless around the 45 minute mark and he is a very good movie watcher (not to brag or anything). But the second half brings the noise, as it were, and we all get to see what we paid for: The Hulk smashing stuff. The final fight sequence clocks in at close to half-an-hour as The Hulk battles Tim Roth as Abomination for, um, wellI don't really remember what for. Does it matter? It was Hulk vs. Bigger Hulk and there was much smashing and crunching and car throwing and it was good.Overall, The Incredible Hulk was definitely worth the price of admission. Marvel Studios was smart to reboot the franchise. Judging by the hints they've been dropping and cameos that have been popping up in this movie and Iron Man, they appear to be laying the groundwork for the biggest comic book movie in the history of comic book movies: The Avengersand I for one, can't wait.On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being Superman and 1 being Condorman, The Incredible Hulk gets a 7.","

"jimmy2","15 June 2008","I must say that this film is exactly what a Hulk film should be. It should be a mix of 'The Fugitive' and 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'. The last film wasn't like that at all. Matter of fact, the plot plodded in places, ruining the momentum. None of that here.Having said that, it's still not the best film of the summer. Why? Well, there's not enough emotional investment into the relationship between Bruce and Betty. What's there on film is great, but a bit more back-history would be nice as well. I wonder if that's what Edward Norton was aiming for before Marvel decided to truncate the film. Regardless, I can't wait to see the additional footage in the Blu-ray and DVD version. If that relationship is fleshed out more, it would almost be the perfect Hulk film. As such for the theater release, it's very strong, but more could have been done.There are some very jaw-dropping scenes in this film, but at the same time, this Hulk seems more human somehow, compared to the last film. This Hulk can actually be hurt, and there's real pain that shows on his face, especially when he fights Abomination. This adds a depth of character to this normally one-dimensional portrayal in the other film. I don't recall any particular moment where the Hulk in the other movie was in pain, or even if he bled. Good move by Marvel to make him a more human monster.If anybody was concerned about whether or not this movie is better than the last Hulk film, rest assured that Marvel learned their lesson. The only complaint I have is what I said before; I believe Marvel wanted a film to so totally not be like the other one that they removed a good portion of the pathos from it in order to move things along. However, any complaint about that will have to wait until the DVD/Blu-ray release. I can't wait! Meanwhile, go watch the film and enjoy what's there.","

"ghostofmrpalmer","14 June 2008","OK, let me start off with a confession, I do not like Edward Norton. I do not like him as an actor, and I do not like him as a person. I believe he is the product of all the worst aspects of the misused and misunderstood practice of method acting, and I think he's an egomaniac and a terrible ""Film maker"", see ""American History X"" for what I mean. So lets get to ""The Hulk"". This film was of course going to be compared to Ang Lee's commercial and critical failure ""Hulk"". I myself did not like ""Hulk"", but I have to admit that it had more to do with the writing and the story than with the actors and film makers. ""Hulk"" actually had some original ideas in how to present the mythology of a comic book on film. The cast i felt in that movie was actually good, they just had a crap story to work with. ""Hulk"" was really an overwrought soap opera between the title character and his father, which to be fair in 80's the comic did explore Banner's relationship with his father and it explained his anger issues.Now we come to the new film ""The Incredible Hulk"", he we have a story less melodramatic, but somehow even more hollow and lacking in any intelligent subtlety. Edward Norton can not write. let me put it this way, as a writer Norton is a great actor, and as an actor, Norton is a great paralegal (please someone get that joke). Much was made about Norton writing a draft for the film to give the character more depth, but its not there. Also, Norton has made a huge deal out of not promoting the film as he feels its poorly made, the editing in particular. On that we can agree, but I have no doubt in my mind he could only make it worse. With ""American History X"" the director found it unbearable to work with Norton and left. Norton than re-edited the film, and gave himself more screen time and took the focus of the story from the white power movement and it's complexity and frightening aspects, to his acting abilities. ""The Incredible Hulk"" is edited perfectly naturally and well, so all Norton could do is add more footage of himself, and less of the actual Hulk. There are no opportunities to do and dialectic Eisenstien editing in Hulk, or and Bressonian elliptical editing, its just not that kind of movie.I understand not every film needs to be ""Au hasard balthazar"" or ""The 400 Blows"", but even the summer blockbusters can be smart and entertaining, but ""The Incredible Hulk"" is neither. Unfortunately I believe most people don't care how crappy a movie is, just that is has lots of CGI and explosions, and they'll be happy. I on the other hand will be making better use of my time watching Willam Friedkin's ""Sorcerer"" on DVD, or ""Mon Oncle Antoine"" when it comes out on CC.","

"dv-rec","17 November 2008","Some people say, that the first try of a new Hulk Version from 2003 was too much intellectual driven, which gave the film a too complex story and emotional background to believe in and not enough room for action.In fact this new Version of the Hulk theme could not even keep up with the first one in any possible discipline. It lacks nearly anything, except a slightly better CGI. The cast was really promising, but the whole story is totally empty and lacks of any surprises at all. The whole intention of a movie with a believable plot supported by actors and good directing is simply not used in this one.You can easily skip the middle 70 minutes of the film, because everything is so obvious to happen. Compared to the storyline of the first one this new version lacks of any depth and drama. It's like being told a story with a 10 point plan what is going to happen now and then and finally the good spirit wins.So, what is good in this new version? Nothing at all. There is even no real humor noticeable, no emotional ups and lows, and we will never know why Tim Roth did all this silly stuff. I did not like the first one too much at the time i saw it, but in comparison to this new one it's a quite good movie after all.I don't know where the good screenwriters are gone in Hollywood. For this new Hulk there was definitely none involved.","

Liv Tyler I can't stand period, anyone could have done better. The story was again ok, not great but I thought the action made up for it. I hate they haven't done anything with the Leader teaser.","

"dregj","10 April 2010","Compared to the last travesty Called the hulk This film is about 3 million times better .The character of banner is actually believable and doesn't suffer from pointless flashbacks that make no sense.Mostly it doesn't suffer from Ang Lee attempting to shoe horn his own weird story into a movie called hulk. The action is absolutely breathtaking and inventive .The sad love story between Betty and banner was tragic ,even the few moments of comedy didn't jar with the rest of the film .The end was pure classic hulkA thoughtful ,intelligent movie about a monster and the monstrous men that want to use him for their own ends","

"GOWBTW","13 June 2008","The first HULK movie was just the beginning. It was a bit on the dark side. The only enemies he had to face were the Hulk-dogs and the Army. ""The Incredible Hulk"" is an overall improvement from the first. There was a plot, there was an enemy, there was some action. The cast was great. Edward Norton as the brilliant Dr. Bruce Banner; Liv Tyler as Dr. Elizabeth ""Betty"" Ross; William Hurt as General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross; Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky aka ""The Abomination""(A Hulk-wannabe). The CGI graphics were indeed top-notched. Better than Ang Lee's. But if it wasn't for Ang Lee's version 5 years ago, there wouldn't be another movie. So give that guy some credit! The battle scene between the Hulk(Norton) and the Army was classic. Taking out those Hummers, using the crude shields against the fire-power. The New York scene is great: Hulk vs. Abomination. Ilkied the part where the Hulk used the police car as ""boxing gloves"". The Abomination is stronger than the Hulk at first(He can lift 100 tons with ease), but he lacks the rage power. The Hulk's strength is unlimited(100 tons+) so he can kick serious butt with any enemy he faces. Dr. Samuel Sterns is another character to be reckoned with. He'll be known as the villainous Leader. The Hulk got to do more things in this movie: The Thunder Clap, and his trademark words: HULK SMASH!! Whch was voiced by the original, Lou Ferrigno which by chance plays a Security Guard who gets a free medium pizza. This movie is an improvement big time. Liked the cast, the storyline, the honorable mention of Bill Bixby in his earlier work. A younger Jack McGee who was played by the late Jack Colvin. This movie's got some 70's nostalgia there. I just want to Hulk out, and see it again and again. HULK SMASH! This one tops the 2003 version, big time! 5 STARS!","

"diac228","14 June 2008","It is never a good sign for a franchise to receive a reboot after just one installment. However, Hulk gets a second chance with the latest film from the Marvel team that has brought us this summer's biggest hit and best film thus farand that's an answer that shall not change by the end of this review. The Incredible Hulk handles just like a comic book: bad dialogue, plenty of action, massive-sized plot holes, plenty of cameos, and ends with us asking for more. The movie fails to really lift the franchise from the ashes of mediocrity as yet again we receive a sub par Hulk movie that fails to bring out the best in our green hero. Good acting and decent CGI is hampered by too many other errors, setbacks, and disappointments that turn Hulk into nothing more than an American version of Godzilla. Yes, there's more to Hulk than meets the eye, but Louis Leterrier and company fail to deliver this to us.In a well-scripted prologue, we see Bruce Banner accidentally kill people and injure others after an experiment gone wrong; which we all know turns him into the Hulk. He hides in Brazil (Not the best place to hide if you are light-skinned, I know) as he tries to find a cure for his rage. While he hides and runs (In this movie, traveling from country to country and state to state on no money is no problem), the United States army is after him to use his accident and turn it into a successful innovation in warfare.This isn't a continuation of the original Hulk, it's rather a refresher, or a reboot; in the sense of Batman Begins and Casino Royale. After the prologue, the dialogue goes downhill in a most awful way. Whether its lines that aren't supposed to deliver a laugh, to lines that should not have been said at all, there are a lot of cringe-worthy moments in Hulk just listening to people talk. The acting doesn't exactly help either, as only Tim Roth and Edward Norton pulling off respectable performances. The two actors are well-known for their versatility and breathing life into any role, and they are no exception here until the CGI gets mixed in.While the trailers do promise action and more action, The Incredible Hulk is mostly running, hiding, talking, and preparation for the final act in the movie. The opening chase sequence is good; the rest of the action doesn't quite live up to it. When Banner becomes Hulk, it's like watching a very angry toddler wreck havoc on a town of Legos. Banner/Hulk just fails to have the charisma of Stark, the coolness of Batman, and the emotional depth of Peter Parker. Things get destroyed, and then Banner's love interest (pretty but meh Liv Tyler as Betty) stops the carnage; the formula doesn't quite change. Even the carnage itself becomes repetitive.Hulk does lack the dimensions of a deep character, but it's hard to like the main character when he becomes the vicious being. Being able to calm down for only the love interest in the entire movie doesn't exactly garnish brownie points from the audience; luckily the audience wants to see epic fights and destruction to the nth degree (These people should not question the appeal of Godzilla).Bottom Line: The Incredible Hulk is nothing like the Ang Lee version, but it still fails to live up to most Marvel comic book movies. There's so much that went wrong here, its hard to praise anything going on. Most of the acting is bland, the final fight isn't as epic as one would hope, and it lacks the fun of Iron Man. Perhaps this character was never meant to be in a movie; that or needs a strong supporting role to help him entertain the audience. Another major drawback is the amount of wicked cop-outs and sudden disappearances of supporting roles. Luckily the final scene gives us all hope, as we are seeing the beginning of something potentially awesome. In the meantime, we have to suck up another second-rate Hulk movie.At least its no Batman and Robin.",NA
"PWNYCNY","16 June 2008","FIrst, Edward Norton is no Bill Bixby and second, how many ""Hulks"" does this movie need? This movie has several glaring weaknesses: first, the acting is laughable. Tim Roth must be considered as a candidate for the worst actor award for 2008. Second, the story is simplistic. Man is sick, man gets angry, man becomes a monster. Duh. Third, the special effects are almost cartoonish. Is this movie actually a cartoon interspersed with live acting? This confusion of style is now typical of most Hollywood action/sci-fi movies. Fourth, little character development. The characters are two-dimensional facsimiles directly out of the Hollywood potboiler mold. Liv Tyler's performance is utterly flat. It's not her fault; it's the material she has to work with. Betty Davis and Joan Crawford probably would have fared little better, but at least they would have given the role a little more flare. This movie is a remake of a remake and shows it, a really empty vessel. No originality. Intellectually empty. A huge Hollywood fx extravaganza that, like all the celluloid garbage that has preceded it, will eventually find its way to DVD land and oblivion.",NA
"jaredmobarak","15 June 2008","Leave it to this drama lover to think that the new film The Incredible Hulk is more boring than Ang Lee's Hulk from 2003, despite the fact that the entire world hated that version because they said it was too slow. Maybe it was the departure in genre tone that Lee brought to the movie, making it a psychological tale of humanity rather than an action, comic-book romp, but I was pleasantly surprised after thinking it would just be Hulk-Smash over and over again. The funny thing is that knowing this new variation, from Transporter director Louis Leterrier, would be action packed, destruction heavy chaos, I was all for it. I liked the original film and wasn't quite sure this reboot was totally necessary, but I have to admit I was excited to see some fights, especially after hearing the end battle lives up to the hype, something that lacked in Iron Man and Batman Begins. Unfortunately, while the scuffles were pretty hectic and a lot of fun, everything else, most noticeably the middle third, dragged. It could be that the extremes were too far apart, leaving the testosterone-laden mini-warzones to go to scientific computer speak or blatant sexual tension between the past loves of Bruce Banner and Betty Ross, but I think it was just that those slow moments were too long and not the forte of the filmmakers. Leterrier handled the mix of drama and action much better in Danny the Dog, possibly due to the writing from auteur Luc Besson. Maybe it was Zak Penn's script, possibly it was the extreme highs of the fights creating even more extreme lows, either way, to me, Hulk was more consistent and a better film. That's not saying this new installment is bad; it has a lot going for it and if nothing else shows that the subject mater is still viable for a third film featuring The Leader as a villain.The credit sequence shows how Banner infects himself with gamma radiation and what happens to make him leave the country as Betty and her General father recover from the aftereffects. Nothing about the past army base history of Banner's parents or Nick Nolte's electricity love is alluded to or acknowledged from Hulk. This film is a reboot through and through, just pretend the first never existed, it's what the filmmakers do. Basically, the exposition is glossed overhis experiment causing the infection, his inability to survive with it while amongst the ones he loves, and his self-imposed exile to Brazil in order to look for a cureall relayed in the first twenty or so minutes. The action really starts once General Ross catches up with his former employee and love of his daughter as he attempts to extract him back to the US. This mission expedites Banner's return for a cure and his crossing paths with Betty once again, as well as an encounter with the Russian-born Brit military man Emil Blonsky, whose craving for a fight and infatuation with the power he sees coming from the Hulk makes him decide to do whatever it takes to acquire that strength for himself. So, this film is really just an extended attempt to capture Banner as he tries to cure himself, (oh and the fact that we believe he might be cured for only ten seconds before they completely disregard that whole plot line in order for a war to break out is just one of the many failures of plot lines that could have been very interesting). At the end, we really find that we are in the exact same situation we were in at the startexcept now Betty knows her Bruce is alive.While the story may be lacking, the action is not. Tim Roth, as Blonsky, has a wild fire raging behind his eyes. The guy will not give up, despite any odds piled against him. When he takes a taste of the gamma poisoning in order to even the playing field versus the Hulk, you just know that small sample will never satiate his lust for blood. Super-Roth goes against the green giant and it is pretty exciting, even the sonar cannon effects are cool to watch as they attempt to stop the monster. The final battle is a lot of fun with destruction, but it is the chase scene in Brazil that sticks to mind after leaving the theatre. Brazil's cityscape is ripe for an extended sequence with its housing and factories all jammed packed together on a hillside with barely room for a street between them. Banner and Blonsky run after each other while extras from Bruce's job crop up with a bad attitude. The first transformation finally occurs, yet most of it is seen from the shadows. A brilliant use of deflection helps make the chase more exhilarating than the computer generated fight at the finaleno matter how much fun that still ends up being.The boring, drawn out exchanges between action set pieces may ruin the pacing and enjoyment, but to me it is really the new cast at fault. Whether you liked Lee's version or not, you shouldn't be able to question the actors involved. All those on screen here pale in comparison and probably cause the mediocrity of those scenes. Liv Tyler's whisper doesn't have the same panache as the strong-willed Jennifer Connolly, William Hurt's overacting to be the hardass can't touch Sam Elliot's natural born proclivity to that demeanor, and, no matter how much I like Ed Norton, Eric Bana hit the conflicted internal struggle emotive quality out of the park in Hulk. Maybe if the old cast was brought into this film, the parts that fail could have worked and rather then bring down the smash and grab moments, could have enhanced their success, making the enjoyment level higher and the film better as a result.",NA
"michael-3204","30 January 2016","The second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a rebooted Hulk that pretends the 2003 version directed by Ang Lee never happened. One of the virtues of this attempt is that it doesn't spend much time on Hulk's origin story, mostly dispensing with it in the opening credits montage. I think this is the filmmakers at least acknowledging that, yes, we all saw this story a few years prior and we really don't need much detail. Another virtue is Tim Roth, whose rat-like Emil Blonsky injects some much needed verve into the proceedings, as does Tim Blake Nelson in the smaller role of Samuel Sterns. The rest of the cast is saddled with playing one note each in one-dimensional roles. Edward Norton and Liv Tyler seem like they would be more convincing as a pair of siblings than as former lovers. Neither are quite as somber or severe as Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly were in the same roles, but neither really manage to make Bruce Banner or Betty Ross terribly memorable. (We get a brief shout-out to Bill Bixby in the form of a television clip from ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father,"" but that just brought home the sad fact that we haven't had a finer Bruce Banner than Bixby in the 1970's Hulk TV show. Sorry, Mark Ruffalo, thanks for trying.) It seems that most of whatever creative energy was spent here went into rendering a convincing Hulk who can convincingly smash stuff and interact with human characters, and on that score the film succeeds. If only the human characters were more interesting, we might have something here. This isn't the worst film in the MCU (the worst, to date, would come next), but it is the most boring.",NA
"doctorkananga","16 June 2008","This film is amazing! You can actually tell that the director, Edward Norton, and Tim Roth are fans of The Incredible Hulk unlike most Marvel films. The Incredible Hulk is such an underrated comic series, I would probably say Bruce Banner is the one of the most emotionally intriguing characters in Marvel. So what is your favorite Marvel film to date? X-Men? Spider-man? Iron Man? Well I'm a fan of all of those mentioned but I would say that The Incredible Hulk is better than the ones mentioned because it stays true to the comics/TV series. X-Men and Spider-man had lots of problems that I won't get into right now, and several are saying that Iron Man is the best Marvel movie now. Well, Iron Man may perhaps be the most ""fun"" film, but due to The Incredible Hulk having more interesting characters, great cinematography, and a great score make this an epic masterpiece. There are so many things in the film that made my inner-nerd geek-out, including cameos by the late Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno, and Stan Lee. I also loved the use of ""The Lonely Man"" and ""Hulk Smash"". The cast was also amazing in this...I believed that Edward Norton was a scientist on the run, that Liv Tyler and him had a past together and believable chemistry. I believed Tim Roth was an aging mercenary that was power-hungry and wanted to find the fountain of youth, and that William Hurt was a corrupt General...but to him Hulk is the bad guy. William Hurt totally gets into character here as always, he doesn't look or sound like himself, crazy.",NA
"das417","23 June 2008","Hollywood is convinced that in order to tell a good story, especially in regards to a comic book movie, that it needs big actors and CGI effects that cost millions. While the first is understandable, the latter often means a lack of script, dialog, and overall plot which hinders the movie the CGI was supposed to help. This is the case with the latest installment of The Incredible Hulk.Dr. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is desperate to escape not only United States Army General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) but the very ""beast"" within him that transforms him into a dangerous and powerful creature with powers of strength far beyond anything human. While in hiding Dr. Banner longs for his love Dr. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) who, ironically, happens to be the daughter of General Ross. His existence is a lonely one that has taken him across the Western Hemisphere in order to not only stay free but to also find a cure.General Ross, a determined officer who sees weapon potentials in Dr. Banner's abilities, brings in Royal Marine Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to head a special forces team to track Dr. Banner who is discovered to be in Brazil. It is then that Blonsky will realize the force of Dr. Banner's power while coming to the realization that he wants that power as well.The setup for The Incredible Hulk is one that promises more than the standard comic book fare. A unique introduction that tells the story of Banner's transformation, which later leaves to a desperate chase scene through the favelas of Brazil, are unfortunately the only moments of the Incredible Hulk worth remembering. The problems almost begin immediately when Dr. Banner returns to the US and contacts Betty before finding himself facing a now transformed Blonsky who is willing to take the power of gamma mutation to the next level.However, if there is one thing to be critical about the Incredible Hulk, it is the poor writing which leads to unconvincing and poor dialogue. William Hurt and Tim Roth with the lines they were given might as well have been stage actors from some melodramatic stage play from the late 1890's. All they were missing where the long, black mustaches to twirl while they think of their devious plans. Liv Taylor in particular proves that either she has the ability to only find movies that give her clichéd and limited characters or, more likely, that she really can't act beyond a tearful love interest. Edward Norton himself is constrained by a script that leaves him little more than looks of desperation with wide eyes.CGI is understandably an important factor in movies like the Incredible Hulk. However, when the CGI alone is the most impressive thing about any movie (and even some of the CGI battle scenes are silly even for a comic book movie) there is going to be problems elsewhere. The Incredible Hulk proves why CGI alone cannot and will not make a good story.7/10",NA
"naomimuldrew27","31 July 2020","I can't understand why this movie gets such a hard time! I honestly love it. Ed Norton is brilliant as Banner. Definetely worth far more than the current score on here.",NA
"Dillypogo","27 October 2008","You certainly won't like Edward Norton when he's angry...or maybe you will and he'll entertain you for a couple of hours. He stars as scientist Bruce Banner, who takes part in an experiment that ends up turning him into a giant monster whenever he suffers stress. As he desperately searches for a cure, he is hunted by General Ross (William Hurt) who wants to extract the condition from Banner and make an army of super-soldiers.Due to Ang Lee's very disappointing 2003 version of Hulk, the green giant was given a reboot in the form of Louis Leterrier's The Incredible Hulk. This is far superior to Lee's movie, which was overlong and took itself too seriously. Unlike Lee's one, The Incredible Hulk doesn't dwell on the origin story for too long, which leaves more time for some kick-ass action scenes. The reboot was a great idea and I'd like to thank whoever came up with it for giving me back my faith in the Hulk.The special effects in The Incredible Hulk are amazingly constructed and really stunned me. Although maybe not 100% perfect, they're good enough to flabbergast the average viewer. Their use in the astonishing battle between The Hulk and The Abomination is quite simply fantastic.The Incredible Hulk contains some references to past versions of it. For example, Bill Bixby, who played Dr. David Bruce Banner in the 1980's TV series, makes a posthumous appearance on a TV screen. Also, the famous purple trousers are used for a joke. And, of course, the legend that is the creator of The Hulk, Stan Lee, has a small cameo.Edward Norton does a far better job than Eric Bana did in the 2003 Hulk. Norton embodies the role perfectly and is very memorable, whereas Bana didn't really fit in with the character. Also on fine form are William Hurt as General Ross and Liv Tyler as Banner's love interest, Betty Ross. Tim Roth is brilliant in the part of villain Emil Blonsky, who soon becomes the monstrous Abomination.The Incredible Hulk has many visually stunning, adrenaline-pumping battle scenes which really make the movie great. Obviously, the best is the action-packed finale between the two monsters of the film. However, the action scenes don't distract from the relationship between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross, which works a lot better than that of the 2003 version.With fantastic special effects and great action scenes, The Incredible Hulk truly is incredible. I give it 9/10.",NA
"ryanskywalker-87402","27 April 2017","The incredible hulk with whom I am most familiar, albeit through the 1970s live-action series and the 1990s animated one. The film is great fun from start to finish. It may not have the same level of characterization as its predecessor ""Iron Man"" but I thought that the action scenes were more entertaining and the pacing was considerably better. The script is well written by Zak Penn and the star Edward Norton (uncredited in this capacity) and Louis Leterrier directs the film with style. It's a shame that the Hulk has gone on to become the Marvel Cinematic Universe's answer to the Wolf Man in that he got one film (the 2003 version notwithstanding) and then only showed up in crossover films rather than getting a sequel to himself. The film had great potential for a proper sequel but I don't really see it happening at this stage.Norton is extremely good as Bruce Banner who, in this version of events, was exposed to gamma radiation deliberately in a failed attempt by the US military to revive its World War II super-soldier project, something which would later be explored on screen in much more detail in ""Captain America: The First Avenger"". I generally prefer superheroes with powers as opposed to non-powered ones and the thing that I always liked about the Hulk's storyline is that there is a great sense of inner conflict. The Hulk represents the primitive, bestial side of human nature and is, in that sense, a throwback to our distant ancestors while Banner represents the better angels of our nature. We all have to struggle with the more primitive parts of us at times, though not quite so literally. However, the line is blurred somewhat in the film as the Hulk is not as animalistic as in other versions. The script does not allow Norton the same opportunity as Robert Downey, Jr. to play a character who grows and develops over the course of the film. However, he gives a great, understated performance and I always felt that the Hulk was just beneath the surface, waiting to manifest himself. I'm rather disappointed that this was Norton's only outing in the role.Betty Ross, played well by Liv Tyler, is not quite as strong a character as I would have liked but she is much better than Pepper Potts in ""Iron Man"". Betty is extremely intelligent, kind, brave, resourceful and loyal. It is obvious from the beginning why Bruce is attracted to her. Speaking of which, their romantic moments seemed a great deal more realistic and heartfelt than those between Tony and Pepper in ""Iron Man"" and I am including the very sweet scene in which she calms down the Hulk in that. Bruce and Betty seem much more evenly managed and suited to each other, frankly. Tim Roth is as creepy and effective as you would expect as the Russian-born British Royal Marines officer Emil Blonsky but I would have preferred a better actor than the decent but not great William Hurt as General Ross. Tim Blake Nelson is great as Samuel Sterns and Ty Burrell has a nice cameo role as Betty's new boyfriend Leonard Samson. In a refreshing move, the film avoids the obvious cliché of making the other man in the love triangle a complete ass. Leonard is a nice, decent guy.The CGI in the film is very good if not quite state of the art by 2008 standards. It is at its most impressive during the hugely entertaining climactic battle between the Hulk and the mutated Blonsky. The Hulk looked better in the nighttime scenes than in the daytime ones. It was a good idea from a dramatic point of view that the Hulk's manifestations were relatively few and far between. I appreciated the somewhat light-hearted atmosphere of the film and the references to the 1970s TV series, most notably Lou Ferrigno's cameo as a security guard - he also provided the voice of the Hulk - and the clip of Bill Bixby, a lovely tribute to the late actor who is more associated with the role of David Banner (what's in a name?) than anyone else.",NA
"necromayhem_the_return","16 June 2008","So Hulk it is..Great!!! First of all, Norton was the best choice. A shy small man that becomes a beast? Smart move. Plus he is a good actor, which adds to the role of such a movie, where you are not supposed to take it seriously.As with Iron Man, the protagonist is a remarkable actor, although in Iron Man the action was lame, the story repetitive, the usual boring happy ending and overall the only thing worth mentioning about it is the performance.What we have here is a movie with good pace, interesting characters and exciting action (FINALLY). Liv Tyler was OK. Norton great. CGI awesome.WHAT STANDS OUT IS THE ACTION.

His acting fit very well with the role as Burce Banner. The fight scenes with abomination where awesome and very well done! The CGI in the movie was really good and it not bad as everyone said it was because The CGI in Hulk (2003) was bad due to the skin texture was crap. In the 2003 film, when bullets hit him, his skin ripples and wobbles. But in this new Hulk movie, the skin texture look better and more realistic then the design in the 2003 movie. The story is very simple to flow and the opening credits for the movie shows how Burce became the Hulk, so you don't have to worry about the story being slow.This movie is awesome and it worth checking out.",NA
"PaperMarioKnight4178","18 November 2022","So, this is what we get next in the MCU. Introduce the next hero, that being the Incredible Hulk, and uh... sorry to say, it wasn't incredible. But, as the forgotten MCU movie, I don't really get why it's forgotten. Is it because of the recast, is it because of the ret-cons. Well, here the review on what I thought about it. Here is my review of the Incredible Hulk (2008):The good: Edward Norton is amazing as the titular character. Although this is the only time I saw any of his films, he does a really good job with what he's given, and most of the casting here is really good. William Hurt in particular is amazing as Thaddeus Ross, as well as Ross being an amazing character that I wished we saw more of (R. I. P. William Hurt). The story is decent, and the action is amazing, with personal stakes, and an amazing fight with just two monsters battling in such an enjoyable and memorable way, with the emotions hitting it right. So what's the problem. Well...The bad: The story itself is kinda generic, and not all that interesting, which is weird, since, in the shows like Avengers: Earths Mightiest Heroes it's done well, in the comics, its amazing, but it feels kinda generic and boring, to the point where I just want to get to Hulk, and the pacing doesn't help it, since even though the films not that long, it feels very patted out and drawn out just to make it feel like a big blockbuster movie. Along with that, they set up some amazing things to come for the Hulk like the Leader, and do nothing with it. Abomination wasn't particularly a favourite villain of mine, he's fine, but not amazing, and I was just bored until the third act. Oh, and the cgi for the Hulk isn't that good.Final Verdict: Despite my negative feelings for this film, I still think it shouldn't have been known as the forgotten MCU movie. It offered chances to go in interesting ways, but it isn't even picked up again. I wish that the MCU can look back and see on how they can improve on a Hulk story, cause there are ways to do it. Also, just wished we got more of Edward here. Mark's fine, but... I'll save that for later. I'll give this film a 6.5/10.",NA
"dayton-w-price","20 May 2020","I've been a fan of the Incredible Hulk for over 20 years, I started watching the show from the 70's with my dad, that started my love and eventual obsession with the titular character, thanks to Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, I've been hooked ever sense, I was very pleased with this film and was happy to see Lou, have a cameo as a security guard. I loved this movie because it felt and looked like a Hulk film, it even copied the look and design of the radiation chair machine, from the 70's series. I also loved it as much as the 2003 film which is the most underrated and misunderstood superhero movies ever.

"jkellylincoln","27 June 2008","When Ang Lee made the Hulk people were not disappointed but not satisfied. So it came as no surprise that the film makers decided not to make the two other Hulk movies planned. So when The Incredible Hulk was in development I had major doubts.But all these doubts became deafened by the good trailer and me seeing the actual movie.The movie made the right choice for casting Ed Norton as Bruce Banner and all the other actors particularly Tim Routh as Emil Blonsky worked pretty good to me.The movie is far more action oriented, great with a more understandable origin and a more vulnerable Hulk. Hence why they would make the Abomination a superior match to the Hulk. The acting and the hyper-realistic tone are all done very well and it is a great movie. I like how they were able to put in the Leader as a nice little hidden bonus for fans and Tony Stark revealing the plans about the Avengers.My two regrets are that this new General Ross is not as menacing as Sam Elliot and that it did not have some of the science explained enough.",NA
"btm1","8 August 2009","If this version of the Incredible Hulk was done in the fashion of an animated cartoon perhaps I would have liked it better. Graphic artists really know how to draw monsters.Here the monsters look like some kind of monster suit a kid might get for Halloween. They are so obviously artificial! The special effects of the monsters throwing cars about also seem ridiculously artificial. Am I being picky expecting a comic book character to appear realistic? Well, they did it in the original TV series. They used a simple technique. Instead of costumes (or whatever) the TV series used super-sized Lou Ferrigno as the hulk, just painting his skin green. But a Ferrigno sized hulk apparently was too small for the makers of this film.In the interests of full disclosure, I have to admit I am not a big fan of action films. There are some I liked, including about everything by Quentin Tarentino. I liked Superman and Batman films, but got bored by too many sequels. But the main reason I wanted to see the Incredible Hulk was to see how the they handled the transformation, expecting something outstanding what with all the technology advances made in the past decade.",NA

"Quinoa1984","13 June 2008","I wasn't sure if this new reboot-cum-remake-cum-sequel to 2003's Ang Lee Hulk would make as good, or better than the predecessor. Turns out that the director Louis Leterrier and writer Zak Penn capture the spirit of the Hulk from the comics with lots of fiery action and panache, if not with the flawed ambition of Lee's vision. It's a bashing, smashing, exciting summer blockbuster, giving what it delivers for the fans of the books and even the cheesy 70s TV series, even if it's not quite a great comic book movie. It's also less substantive than other Marvel movies like Spider-Man and Iron Man.Actually, in a couple of ways, it's close to being better entry than the previous entry, and not simply because Leterrier is suited for the material. Edward Norton fulfills the role of Banner/Hulk with a level of intelligence and subtlety that is uncommon for a role like this. It's great to see him and Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky/Abomination face off and fill up their two-dimensional roles to the hilt. William Hurt is also good as the General Ross, after him with any and all means at his disposal but not a clue to how really to stop him (mostly his role consists of commands barked and some glances of concern over his daughter). Only Liv Tyler is only so-so, often pouting or giving the same look of concern or affection for Banner that makes one pine for Jennifer Connelly from the previous Hulk.There are moments that disappoint or feel unfulfilled (Stan Lee's cameo here is just a plot device for a bit with Banner's blood in a drink where it could've made for something more interesting than a ""hey, it's Stan Lee"" cameo), and the drive of the story for Leterrier is to load it with music in pretty much every scene. But then there are those terrific scenes of the Hulk doing what many of us love best about the jolly green giant: smashing s*** up to pieces, and having the occasional King Kong beat as the only one who can make him calm down is the girl of his life. Hell, we even get an artistically amazing scene when the Hulk first emerges out of the shadows and darkness in the factory. And by the time Leterrier gets us to the climax, with Hulk and Abomination facing off, it's like eating a box of candy: CGI coated and with the only necessity to keep the action fast and harrowing, but not rushed.In short, it's an improvement in some ways (not to totally trash Ang Lee's film), and only as satisfying as a big-budget summer popcorn flick can be. It's a fun ride, in short, without too much pretension and good performances (plus, of course, the obligatory ""hint"" for an Avengers movie in the last scene).",NA
"Jay_Exiomo","13 June 2008","I may be in the minority here, but I did like Ang Lee's take on ""Hulk"". I appreciated how it chose to be introspective and how it traded off much of the action for character study of a tortured individual. But I also know that such attempt, however earnest, seems more at home with art theaters and film festivals (or at least with late year releases) than with mainstream theaters in summer packed with audience looking for nothing more than a big popcorn movie. Thus, this immediate reboot of this Marvel comic book franchise.Now helmed by ""Transporter"" director Louis Leterrier, ""The Incredible Hulk"" completely ignores the existence of the 2003 film - heart, introspection and all - and goes for a more action-packed route. It's what fans are clamoring and the film delivers in that regard - it's definitely bigger, faster, and stronger.Edward Norton now plays Bruce Banner, a scientist who exposed himself to gamma rays during an experiment gone awry, and now turns into a rampaging green giant when angry or overexcited. Now he's on the lam because the father of his flame Betty Ross (a wooden Liv Tyler), General Ross (William Hurt), wants what's inside of him to build a team of superhuman soldiers. When General Ross tracks Banner in a Brazilian shanty town, he sends eager test subject Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to chase Banner and bring him back. More colossal action scenes and nods to the Marvel Universe ensue.Despite the low risk approach and a pretty much straightforward plot line, ""The Incredible Hulk"" has its merits. The film clocks in at less than two hours and for most of its running time, it manages to be entertaining. The CGI is serviceable and Edward Norton is fine as Bruce Banner, though with the script's lightweight treatment on his character, much of the inner conflict is gone and non-action scenes are more of obligatory fillers Leterrier and screenwriter Zak Penn are too eager to be done with. Incidentally Norton, who is reported to have done rewrites with the script, is unhappy with the final cut, but then...I'm not going to be hypocritical and say the absence of profound inward contemplation made the film less enjoyable. It does, to some degree, but all things considered, ""The Incredible Hulk"" has everything a fan of the series could ask for a summer movie: more smashing and less talking.",NA
"srmllr13","12 March 2022","I am behind on the Avenger series as we are now into the next phase. This is overall great. It doesn't make the Hulk cheesy, although I'm old enough to appreciate the T. V. Series. It does answer some questions and provide some background. It's entertaining. I do feel Tim Roth is a little wasted in his role. While Edward Norton is great, I wouldn't compare him with Mark Ruffalo.",NA
"SPZMaxinema","27 April 2022","The movie had some interesting sequences for sure, and provided the main character with a unique backstory and adventure, but it just didn't feel like enough to fully satisfy. They messed up Hulk's hair and I think the movie would've been better if they maybe casted Mark Ruffolo from the very beginning instead of recasting him later. Not a bad movie but definitely one of the worst MCU movies.",NA
