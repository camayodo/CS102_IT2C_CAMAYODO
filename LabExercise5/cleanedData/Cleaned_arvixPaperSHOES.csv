"5","what else would i like? a user simulator using alternatives for improved evaluation of fashion conversational recommendation systems","maria vlachou, craig macdonald","information retrieval","in conversational recommendation systems (crs), a user can provide feedback on recommended items at each interaction turn, leading the crs towards more desirable recommendations. currently, different types of crs offer various possibilities for feedback, i.e., natural language feedback, or answering clarifying questions. in most cases, a user simulator is employed for training as well as evaluating the crs. such user simulators typically critique the current retrieved items based on knowledge of a single target item. still, evaluating systems in offline settings with simulators suffers from problems, such as focusing entirely on a single target item (not addressing the exploratory nature of a recommender system), and exhibiting extreme patience (consistent feedback over a large number of turns). to overcome these limitations, we obtain extra judgements for a selection of alternative items in common crs datasets, namely shoes and fashion iq dresses. going further, we propose improved user simulators that allow simulated users not only to express their preferences about alternative items to their original target, but also to change their mind and level of patience. in our experiments using the relative image captioning crs setting and different crs models, we find that using the knowledge of alternatives by the simulator can have a considerable impact on the evaluation of existing crs models, specifically that the existing single-target evaluation underestimates their effectiveness, and when simulated users are allowed to instead consider alternatives, the system can rapidly respond to more quickly satisfy the user.",2024-01-11

(1) the uncertainty modeling simulates the multi-grained queries by introducing identically distributed fluctuations in the feature space. (2) based on the uncertainty modeling, we further introduce uncertainty regularization to adapt the matching objective according to the fluctuation range. compared with existing methods, the proposed strategy explicitly prevents the model from pushing away potential candidates in the early stage, and thus improves the recall rate. on the three public datasets, i.e., fashioniq, fashion200k, and shoes, the proposed method has achieved +4.03%, +3.38%, and +2.40% recall@50 accuracy over a strong baseline, respectively.",2022-11-14
