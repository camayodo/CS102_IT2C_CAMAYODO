"355","spirited away (2001)","best animated film i have seen","supertom","spirited away is the first miyazaki i have seen but from this stupendous film i can tell he is a master storyteller a hallmark of a good storyteller is making the audience empathise or pull them into the shoes of the central character miyazaki does this brilliantly in spirited away during the first fifteen minutes we have no idea what is going on neither does the main character chihiro we discover the world as chihiro does and its truly amazing to watch but miyazaki doesnt seem to treat this world as something amazing the world is filmed just like our workaday world would the inhabitants of the world go about their daily business as usual as full with apathy as us normal folks places and buildings are not greeted by towering establishing shots and majestic music the fact that this place is amazing doesnt seem to concern miyazaki what do however are the characters miyazaki lingers upon the characters as if they were actors he infixes his animated actors with such subtleties that i have never seen even from animation giants pixar twenty minutes into this film and i completely forgot these were animated characters i started to care for them like they were living and breathing miyazaki treats the modest achievements of chihiro with unashamed bombast the uplifting scene where she cleanses the river god is accompanied by stirring music and is as exciting as watching gladiatorial combatants fight of course by giving the audience developed characters to care about the action and conflicts will always be more exciting terrifying and uplifting than normal generic action scenes through chihiro miyazaki is clearly but nonpatronisingly talking to youth of japan theres a certain sense of revile about the youth of japan at the moment many people consider them to be illmannered and baring no respect for their elders or their forefathers they are simply biproducts of their material world and consumerism spirited away taps into this at the start chihiro is a selfish spoiled whiny brat but as she plunges deeper into the spirit world she becomes more independent more assured more respectful and learns some manners no face a black figure with a white mask is the catalyst behind chihiros transformation once he is let into the bathhouse we are no longer tourists  the story propels forth watching no face prey on the greed of the workers is a terrifying delight the three main characters in miyazakis youth allegory are chihiro no face and b all of these characters are disconnected with their world they are lonely misunderstood and largely ignored but when they go on their journey together they united and become stronger individualsmiyazaki also talks about the ecology of japan what was once a beautiful grassland has now turned into the asian new york that the last samurai had to be filmed in new zealand to get a turn of the century japanese look speaks volumes the river god sequence is an unsubtle but unpretentious commentary on pollution while these two themes are very much current in japan they are also universal themes  which makes spirited away a universal story that most of us can connect with im willing to bet everyone reading this has at some time seen bicycles lying on a lake bed or have had a child talk to them disrespectfully sure these themes arent advanced philosophy they are everyday issues told in an inventive fun waythe animation is wonderful if not as smooth as disneys works  but theres something superior to that spirited aways imperfect but detailed world is far more fascinating than the perfected blandest of disneys latest offerings the animators successfully balanced the tightrope between notenough animation on characters and too much animation on characters no ralph balski add antics here the film is full of vivid images  both beautiful and horrifying the line between those two extremes is crossed over seamlessly from chihiro and haku running through an opening flower field to hakus dragon snarling with a bloody mouth both extremes seem to belong in the film its also excellently done with the characters kamaji can be seen as a scary daunting figure at the beginning but soon he seamlessly changes into a humble wise figure yubaba also seems to be able to turn from kind to witch with the snap of a finger the sound on the film was expertly done the sounds perfectly match the on screen actions and objects my sub woofer got a wonderful workout when haku swoops chihiro past the bridge at the beginning and while i dont speak japanese i think the voice actors did a wonderful job of conveying their personality and emotions true their voice joe hisaishis music is sublime definitely one of my favourite scores his main piano theme is simple and evocative his thunderous action music hits the viewers on the chest like a hammer like all great scores it heightens the greatness of a scene about three times the score unlike many american composers is unobtrusive it plays excellently with the scenes but never overbears them a lot of the time the it is barely noticeable a sole piano plays softly in the background evoking a dreamlikelullaby quality spirited away is a simply a modern masterpiece easily one of the top  films of the new millennium it works on a multitude of levels a social commentary on japan a homage to

"375","spirited away (2001)","best animated film i have seen","supertom","spirited away is the first miyazaki i have seen but from this stupendous film i can tell he is a master storyteller a hallmark of a good storyteller is making the audience empathise or pull them into the shoes of the central character miyazaki does this brilliantly in spirited away during the first fifteen minutes we have no idea what is going on neither does the main character chihiro we discover the world as chihiro does and its truly amazing to watch but miyazaki doesnt seem to treat this world as something amazing the world is filmed just like our workaday world would the inhabitants of the world go about their daily business as usual as full with apathy as us normal folks places and buildings are not greeted by towering establishing shots and majestic music the fact that this place is amazing doesnt seem to concern miyazaki what do however are the characters miyazaki lingers upon the characters as if they were actors he infixes his animated actors with such subtleties that i have never seen even from animation giants pixar twenty minutes into this film and i completely forgot these were animated characters i started to care for them like they were living and breathing miyazaki treats the modest achievements of chihiro with unashamed bombast the uplifting scene where she cleanses the river god is accompanied by stirring music and is as exciting as watching gladiatorial combatants fight of course by giving the audience developed characters to care about the action and conflicts will always be more exciting terrifying and uplifting than normal generic action scenes through chihiro miyazaki is clearly but nonpatronisingly talking to youth of japan theres a certain sense of revile about the youth of japan at the moment many people consider them to be illmannered and baring no respect for their elders or their forefathers they are simply biproducts of their material world and consumerism spirited away taps into this at the start chihiro is a selfish spoiled whiny brat but as she plunges deeper into the spirit world she becomes more independent more assured more respectful and learns some manners no face a black figure with a white mask is the catalyst behind chihiros transformation once he is let into the bathhouse we are no longer tourists  the story propels forth watching no face prey on the greed of the workers is a terrifying delight the three main characters in miyazakis youth allegory are chihiro no face and b all of these characters are disconnected with their world they are lonely misunderstood and largely ignored but when they go on their journey together they united and become stronger individualsmiyazaki also talks about the ecology of japan what was once a beautiful grassland has now turned into the asian new york that the last samurai had to be filmed in new zealand to get a turn of the century japanese look speaks volumes the river god sequence is an unsubtle but unpretentious commentary on pollution while these two themes are very much current in japan they are also universal themes  which makes spirited away a universal story that most of us can connect with im willing to bet everyone reading this has at some time seen bicycles lying on a lake bed or have had a child talk to them disrespectfully sure these themes arent advanced

detailed world is far more fascinating than the perfected blandest of disneys latest offerings the animators successfully balanced the tightrope between notenough animation on characters and too much animation on characters no ralph balski add antics here the film is full of vivid images  both beautiful and horrifying the line between those two extremes is crossed over seamlessly from chihiro and

"394","spirited away (2001)","exceptional but perhaps not so much for the casual viewer","planktonrules","this is a wonderfully imaginative and fantastical childrens fantasy it is easy to see why it was perhaps the critical hit of  the film is glorious to look at it is a testament to old fashioned animation techniques that seem to be resigned to foreign animations of course there is some use of computer imagery for certain shots but they blend seamlessly and the overall artistry involved is superlativethis is the first hayao miyazaki film i have seen and i will certainly watch his others the story plays on many elements successful with kids films that transport you back to your own childhood and also allows the young audience to connect with the themes in the movie too the story centres around chihiro a young girl about to move into a new place and who feels insecure about the new environment she will be living in these fears become a part of her encounter with a strange abandoned amusement park that she and her parents find when they reach a dead end in their car at the park they find that their is a stall that is seemingly open with glorious displays of mouth watering food there are no people about but chihiros parents decide to gorge themselves on this bounty and pay later as chihioro explores she comes across a strange boy who warns her to get out before dark it is too late however because as night falls ghosts are awakened and then by the time she gets back to her parents they are turned into pigs she then finds that the route she came from is gone and she is now trapped in this place her only allie being the boy she met earlier she is told to get a job at the centre piece of the park a bath house run by yubaba an evil power mad witch this is a bath house for the spirits and chihiro has to find a job there before she is found and turned into an animal herself then unable to save her parentsthe story is imaginative and the characters and animations endlessly unique and strange this is just so much more creative than hollywood the characters are likeable and we become engrossed with chihiros adventures inside this bathhouse and the characters she comes into contact with as she tries to get her parents back as humans and whilst trying to get back to the human world what i also loved in this film is that the animation gives it a real sense of cinematography the drawing makes the film stand out in a way that american animations rarely do another film i think of that looked really good was bellville rendezvous another great point in fact the best part of it is the fantastic score it really is uplifting and very original this is just great film making ",2007-06-11,NA
"395","spirited away (2001)","best animated film i have seen","supertom","spirited away is the first miyazaki i have seen but from this stupendous film i can tell he is a master storyteller a hallmark of a good storyteller is making the audience empathise or pull them into the shoes of the central character miyazaki does this brilliantly in spirited away during the first fifteen minutes we have no idea what is going on neither does the main character chihiro we discover the world as chihiro does and its truly amazing to watch but miyazaki doesnt seem to treat this world as something amazing the world is filmed just like our workaday world would the inhabitants of the world go about their daily business as usual as full with apathy as us normal folks places and buildings are not greeted by towering establishing shots and majestic music the fact that this place is amazing doesnt seem to concern miyazaki what do however are the characters miyazaki lingers upon the characters as if they were actors he infixes his animated actors with such subtleties that i have never seen even from animation giants pixar twenty minutes into this film and i completely forgot these were animated characters i started to care for them like they were living and breathing miyazaki treats the modest achievements of chihiro with unashamed bombast the uplifting scene where she cleanses the river god is accompanied by stirring music and is as exciting as watching gladiatorial combatants fight of course by giving the audience developed characters to care about the action and conflicts will always be more exciting terrifying and uplifting than normal generic action scenes through chihiro miyazaki is clearly but nonpatronisingly talking to youth of japan theres a certain sense of revile about the youth of japan at the moment many people consider them to be illmannered and baring no respect for their elders or their forefathers they are simply biproducts of their material world and consumerism spirited away taps into this at the start chihiro is a selfish spoiled whiny brat but as she plunges deeper into the spirit world she becomes more independent more assured more respectful and learns some manners no face a black figure with a white mask is the catalyst behind chihiros transformation once he is let into the bathhouse we are no longer tourists  the story propels forth watching no face prey on the greed of the workers is a terrifying delight the three main characters in miyazakis youth allegory are chihiro no face and b all of these characters are disconnected with their world they are lonely misunderstood and largely ignored but when they go on their journey together they united and become stronger individualsmiyazaki also talks about the ecology of japan what was once a beautiful grassland has now turned into the asian new york that the last samurai had to be filmed in new zealand to get a turn of the century japanese look speaks volumes the river god sequence is an unsubtle but unpretentious commentary on pollution while these two themes are very much current in japan they are also universal themes  which makes spirited away a universal story that most of us can connect with im willing to bet everyone reading this has at some time seen bicycles lying on a lake bed or have had a child talk to them disrespectfully sure these themes arent advanced philosophy they are everyday issues told in an inventive fun waythe animation is wonderful if not as smooth as disneys works  but theres something superior to that spirited aways imperfect but detailed world is far more fascinating than the perfected blandest of disneys latest offerings the animators successfully balanced the tightrope between notenough animation on characters and too much animation on characters no ralph balski add antics here the film is full of vivid images  both beautiful and horrifying the line between those two extremes is crossed over seamlessly from chihiro and haku running through an opening flower field to hakus dragon snarling with a bloody mouth both extremes seem to belong in the film its also excellently done with the characters kamaji can be seen as a scary daunting figure at the beginning but soon he seamlessly changes into a humble wise figure yubaba also seems to be able to turn from kind to witch with the snap of a finger the sound on the film was expertly done the sounds perfectly match the on screen actions and objects my sub woofer got a wonderful workout when haku swoops chihiro past the bridge at the beginning and while i dont speak japanese i think the voice actors did a wonderful job of conveying their personality and emotions true their voice joe hisaishis music is sublime definitely one of my favourite scores his main piano theme is simple and evocative his thunderous action music hits the viewers on the chest like a hammer like all great scores it heightens the greatness of a scene about three times the score unlike many american composers is unobtrusive it plays excellently with the scenes but never overbears them a lot of the time the it is barely noticeable a sole piano plays softly in the background evoking a dreamlikelullaby quality spirited away is a simply a modern masterpiece easily one of the top  films of the new millennium it works on a multitude of levels a social commentary on japan a homage to ancient japaneserussian mythology a moral film for both children and adults but most importantly it is a simple story brilliantly told by a great filmmaker who appears to be at the top of his game

such those moments are annoying to me but again could be theater dependentsthe verdictoverall the praise is worthy to across the spiderverse and i was very happy with much of the film that they brought to life to this theater its a sequel that does things right taking the first movies foundations and bringing with it something to build up and enjoy to the full extent that bold and beautiful art has been refined to near perfection and does so much storytelling alone that its almost enough to go see it just for that in theater but the movie integrates story morals comedy nostalgia and action to a degree that really feels like some of the strongest storytelling in a superhero movie i love the authentic feel of a superhero story and i love the passion of balancing so much in a movie without every losing track of the story to tell sure there were pacing issues and some sound flops for me but thats really minor when it comes to the movie overall and everything they did to make this movie the middle of the trilogy but still stand on its own you can obviously guess im recommending this for the theater and yes families can see it as there arent too much dark moments and my scores

the known cliffhanger was going to come inand to add relative components to it engaging characters and keeping those characters involved in the story that is tough workthe comedy to a degreei really

all the comic and show references of the webbed wonder just taking my child nature and taking it for the roller coaster ride of finding everything i couldbut the movie references as well so much fun as well seeing these micro moments and nods to the other universes and watching them blended into the comedy and storythen to have it just in the world its going to make for a fun rewatch potential in the futurethe action scenesa huge step up across the spiderverse took my dislike from the first film and unleashed much more of the action i knew it hadthe opening scene paints for some great things to come but soon the fight scenes and adventure transform into something that is fun exciting and family friendlychase scenes have energy with styles that flow and show off the heart of the animation feels of the comic book and fan art coming together into this cascade of color and energyi loved the way that they evolved past punches and added more emotions and stakes that though predictable still held glimmer of exciting twists if they comeand the fact they can punch kick and slam without being bloody messes should please so many alongside the fact that the action all goes in line with the actual plotthe animationart styleyouve seen the trailers and the first one and know how beautiful the movie is amidst the blurry backgrounds the movie really has bold art direction that captures comic book spiritthe computer animation goes well with the natural feel of the art and i loved the way it felt like flipping through a flip book and seeing it come to lifeit respects both worlds so well and like the story keeps things easy to follow and discover to appreciate everything the spiderverse had to offer that was epicand to keep all that in relatively stable camera work something the first movie struggled with shows how you can really continue to improve if you take the time and think things throughdislikesthe comedy a bit too forcedthere are times where the humor is a bit forced for me primarily in the moments where they just spout joke after joke after joke to the point where things get lostthese moments are few and far between for me but there are times where a character gets annoying over funnysome pacing offsetsthere are times where the movie trips up on the pace for me a few moments where the conversations are dragged out or we get a tad touchy feeling and not enough of seeing whats going onthis happened about the first hour or so for me but once that part passes most of the movie establishes the pace i talked about for much of the movieat least until the needthe ending  minutes for methe ending  minutes felt very dragged out as it set up the cliffhanger we knew was coming the moment it said part  long agothe ending is very drawn out you know the movie is over and you know what is coming but it uses the art to drag it out bloating the movie for the twenty minutes that could have been in the next moviefortunately one of the final moments adds that fantastic bridge with music shots and feels that work but still we could have cut a few things outand fortunately there are no end credits which there does not need to bethe sound quality with some charactersit might have been my theater but some of the characters mumble and talk fast meaning its hard to hear themspiderpunk has some of the best lines but they get drowned out by background noise mumbling speakers and sound inconsistenciesthis leads to missing several things and taking away from the character that seems so cool and this happens to several other characters when there is so much noise as such those moments are annoying to me but again could be theater dependentsthe verdictoverall the praise is worthy to across the spiderverse and i was very happy with much of the film that they brought to life to this theater its a sequel that does things right taking the first movies foundations and bringing with it something to build up and enjoy to the full extent that bold and beautiful art has been refined to near perfection and does so much storytelling alone that its almost enough to go see it just for that in theater but the movie integrates story morals comedy nostalgia and action to a degree that really feels like some of the strongest storytelling in a superhero movie i love the authentic feel of a superhero story and i love the passion of balancing so much in a movie

it has to tell and miles next story has a lot to tellit found a good pace for me to tell the story giving you the character development but not at a pace that was too slow and lost on itself for the most partyet the movie did manage to keep it slow enough that there was real development build up hints and appreciation to age like fine winethis dynamic was very impressive to me keeping an engaging movie for my attention but not skimping out on the action like some of these deeper movies try to dothat takes talent in the cooking pot as big as this building on the past movie but yet doing its own thing until the end for the setupthe voice actingeveryone rocks in this movie and i have to agree with my friend that it is grade a on many levels with what you get in live action moviesisaac is still strong as the antihero role that he often plays his moodiness his anger his dark edge are mirrored in the character there is hurt anguish and the fire that he shows so well and i love how his voice is the main focus in his performance and not the lookshailee steinfeld is fantastic in gwen its like taking all of her characters from her movie and integrating a piece of them into this gwen and expanding her far into a character i really likedshe was vulnerable and strong a realistic character whose performance came out in spades and fully awakened the character i think they were going forand moore well moore is just freaking amazing as morales that tone vulnerability this maturity but still immaturity cascading and once more evolving a character from the first one being believable a stellar performance and one that i think brought so many things together engaging with each of the others into this dynamic roleit all works so well and i loved the strong talent bringing things to lifethe storytellingthere are so many who say that comic movies seldom tell a good story or are telling the same story over and over again and to a degree they are rightyet for across the spiderverse that story feels fresh engaging and grounded to a degree that helps balance reality and super heroism into a great mashupits not so in your face super adventures that are all about action violence and cgi madness but it also isnt cw bologna about exploring our feelings in colorful underwearthis sequel really focuses so much on building up characters but integrating it into this main comic adventure that works to keep both involved and feel like a superheroi love the heart into it and the way they built up from the first movie but yet made this movie its own thing until the final moments where the known cliffhanger was going to come inand to add relative components to it engaging characters and keeping those characters involved in the story that is tough workthe comedy to a degreei really enjoyed the diverse comedy in this movie and how many types of jokes and styles that were in itmiles is sort of a jack of all trades sarcasm banter slapstick he has a little bit of everything in it and i love itothers are just rambling idiots who are throwing so many jokes and statements that some eventually hit but you have to listen because they fluctuate in terms of volume and suchand other jokes are so welltimed and loaded with sarcasm that you just appreciate the laugh from the time aloneit has it all and in relative balance to keep things fresh and not overwhelmingly stale as they hope from one joke to the otherthe nostalgia and easter eggspart of that comedy comes in the references loaded into this movie almost as much as the plot in this movie and it worksacross the

"571","psycho (1960)","its the little things","telegonus","so much has been written about this film that all i can do is add my own voice of approval and say that i consider it to be a masterpiece and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movies cumulative power its often the little things that make a film work here are a few examplesa the absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in america forty years ago there isnt a false noteor a missed oneas each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if on the surface not much appears to be happeningb marion and the motorcycle cop the cop is dark and sinister in appearance due mostly to the bright desert sun and never takes off his sunglasses his conduct is at all times professional he never raises his voice and comes across as calm and rather perceptive and he seems truly concerned over marion cranes fate though he is unaware of her actual predicament marion is alas a bad actress and the cop sees through this if not to the heart of the matter yet we dont want him to follow her despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather marions last chance had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her and if she had just been a little less clever and driven more slowly and the skies remained clear he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalfc california charlie john anderson is wonderful as the fasttalking semistreetwise small town used car salesman at the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who marion really is then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion he senses that she is being watched by the cop but he also wants to make a sale the scenes at the used car lot are both highly realisticand perfectly acted and timedand also a little frightening from the opening im in no mood for trouble to the final hey just before marion drives away we know that something isnt right but the problem isnt with the car lot its marions plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there despite the brightest sunlight imaginabled chitchat with norman once marion and norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things and norman is a good observer if a bit awkward socially without actually lying marion gives herself away with a throwaway line sometimes just once is enough in a reference to private traps and norman seems to catch her drift if not the actual meaning of what shes saying and allows it to pass we can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight and yet the drama plays out in a light relaxed mode and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion strangers no more this is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted edited and photographed scene i have ever seen in a movie the handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful and the end result nothing less than staggeringe the sheriffs house when sam and lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on the result is a minicomedy of manners but it is also good exposition as we learn of mrs bates death and the dress she was buried in periwinkle blue john mcinyres sheriff dominates this scene and no other and expertly delivers its punchline well if thats mrs bates in the window whos that buried up in greenlawn cemetaryf arbogast and norman the private detectives interview with norman is played lowkey and yet we sense the tension in normans voice and manner and know that arbogast does too something is amiss this is beyond the question of who killed marion the stakes feel very high in this sparring match and though norman wins on a technicality we know that arbogast is coming back for moreg the shrinks explanation this part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience i disagree after all the movie came out in  and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order and dr simon oakland is as good a man for the job as i can imagine his analysis of normans pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered yet throughout his speech with all its freudian brilliance the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience even if we can accept it can never be satisfied with he can explain the character of norman bates rationally but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe feel somehow in control and finalized yes one can put people like norman under the microscope and even dissect what one sees but this doesnt stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur ask milton arbogastin conclusion id like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things not just big moments or fancy effects there is in fact nothing fancy about psycho which is on the surface is a somewhat plainlooking movie only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small thingsgestures glances sudden changes in lighting razorsharp editing and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominatethat we understand the meaning of the word genius the meaning of the word creative",2001-09-05,NA

bright desert sun and never takes off his sunglasses his conduct is at all times professional he never raises his voice and comes across as calm and rather perceptive and he seems truly concerned over marion cranes fate though he is unaware of her actual predicament marion is alas a bad actress and the cop sees through this if not to the heart of the matter yet we dont want him to follow her despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather marions last chance had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her and if she had just been a little less clever and driven more slowly and the skies remained clear he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalfc california charlie john anderson is wonderful as the fasttalking semistreetwise small town used car salesman at the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who marion really is then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion he senses that she is being watched by the cop but he also wants to make a sale the scenes at the used car lot are both highly realisticand perfectly acted and timedand also a little frightening from the opening im in no mood for trouble to the final hey just before marion drives away we know that something isnt right but the problem isnt with the car lot its marions plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there despite the brightest sunlight imaginabled chitchat with norman once marion and norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things and norman is a good observer if a bit awkward socially without actually lying marion gives herself away with a throwaway line sometimes just once is enough in a reference to private traps and norman seems to catch her drift if not the actual meaning of what shes saying and allows it to pass we can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight and yet the drama plays out in a light relaxed mode and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion strangers no more this is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted edited and photographed scene i have ever seen in a movie the handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful and the end result nothing less than staggeringe the sheriffs house when sam and lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on the result is a minicomedy of manners but it is also good exposition as we learn of mrs bates death and the dress she was buried in periwinkle blue john mcinyres sheriff dominates this scene and no other and expertly delivers its punchline well if thats mrs bates in the window whos that buried up in greenlawn cemetaryf arbogast and norman the private detectives interview with norman is played lowkey and yet we sense the tension in normans voice and manner and know that arbogast does too something is amiss this is beyond the question of who killed marion the stakes feel very high in this sparring match and though norman wins on a technicality we know that arbogast is coming back for moreg the shrinks explanation this part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience i disagree after all the movie came out in  and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order and dr simon oakland is as good a man for the job as i can imagine his analysis of normans pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered yet throughout his speech with all its freudian brilliance the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience even if we can accept it can never be satisfied with he can explain the character of norman bates rationally but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe feel somehow in control and finalized yes one can put people like norman under the microscope and even dissect what one sees but this doesnt stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur ask milton arbogastin conclusion id like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things not just big moments or fancy effects there is in fact nothing fancy about psycho which is on the surface is a somewhat plainlooking movie only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small thingsgestures glances sudden changes in lighting razorsharp editing and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one

the character of norman bates rationally but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe feel somehow in control and finalized yes one can put people like norman under the microscope and even dissect what one sees but this doesnt stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur ask milton arbogastin conclusion id like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things not just big moments or fancy effects there is in fact nothing fancy about psycho which is on the surface is a somewhat plainlooking movie only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small thingsgestures glances sudden changes in lighting razorsharp editing and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one

"709","the dark knight rises (2012)","it was okay","christopherreid","there are plenty of elements that made this film work so i suppose we can tick them off one by one for starters the continuation on the focus of bruce waynes story which has made it all tick this version of bruce wayne and alfred become the familiar characters were accustomed with since  and the film invests heavily on the emotional bonding between the two which deals back to the theme about fear that rears its ugly head again and how a father figure cannot stand idly by to watch the one he brought up recklessly charge into battle after a long hiatus and hoping for a life of normalcy with the mantle of the bat given up michael caine may have a shorter screen time than before but no less powerfulwhen sam raimi had to put the popular and powerful venom into spiderman  pretty much against his wishes we all knew how that turned out to be effectively killing off the franchise until the decision to reboot it there may be some similar fears with the introduction of a fairly contemporary villain in bane but the story gave him more purpose and meaning and tom hardy was excellent par none in this role as the compete villain  with plenty of brawn merciless masterful and with a plan any terrorist would be proud of if the scarecrow meant to induce fear and the joker to create chaos bane is carnage incarnate tom hardy even being the requisite mask is fearful and while the designs of his plan may dwarf the jokers in complexity it sure rivaled his in terms of delivery and execution anyone in his path gets shoved aside with deadly consequences and anyone alive is only because there is of further use no hesitation and no compromiseand nolan continues with the introduction of a lot more villains big and small behind a mask or otherwise in his bat films than anyone would credit him for especially when having those whose lines are blurred or corrupt to the core and hiding behind social status and fortune this in turn provides for another arc that boils underneath the main narrative where the rich and powerful continue to enjoy their successes at the expense of the havenots and the occupy movement in a way being a very real parallel to the proceedings on screen while the mobsters were clearly at the top of the food chain in the earlier nolan films this one shifted focus to politicians and the elite community with their fair share of scandals and corporate greedwhile bane was to the point selina kyle played by anne hathaway is both sensual and a force to be reckoned with herself being like how shes best portrayed on the fence theres a bit of frank millers year one in this one given the presence of juno temples holly and the back to basics as a jewel thief compared to the mousy secretary in tim burtons batman returns with michelle pfeiffer defining the role and the garbage that was halle berrys anne hathaway nailed this one with what would be a truly memorable outing and as if a homage of sorts to burtons second batman film that the repartee between bruce wayne and selina kyle at a party became one of the highlights here as does her thievery and combat ability she may lack her whip but more than makes up for it with her steel stiletto heels and the very sensual and sleekly designed feline moves that youd wonder how they got delivered while wrapped under that skin tight suitand not only is the technology put on screen fictionally impressive the technical aspects behind the scenes also worked wonders chalking up serious mileage in having more than an hours worth of footage shot on the imax format wally pfisters cinematography continues to impress with that staying consistent to the gritty look and feel developed for all the bat films to date before his departure into a film directors role for his next project hans zimmer also probably developed the best score for nolans bat films and i dare say without which this film would be less stellar with the score playing a huge role in adding plenty of character and emotion to the film lifting it up with excitement during the many set action pieces with recognizable themes assigned to major players heightening dangers and providing a boost to the many feelings in this one heck of an actionadventure with how things developed at the end and what i felt was initial horror of sorts with batman out in broad daylight secret identity being porous and all this film ended in what would be the best way possible  with possibilities and a twinkle of an eye inception style with a did it or did it not twists turns surprises and sleight of hand making it a clear favourite as one of the best this year do yourself a favour and watch it in the imax format just as it was intendedbecause you have just got to believe in christopher nolan and the kind of films he has so far delivered take a bow batcrew for a trilogy that has now set the bar for any comic book film and especially any other follow

sorrow of conflict are made fresh over again for the viewer left to stumble numb from the cinema thereafter produced for the th anniversary of russias triumph over the german invaders in ww based upon a novella by a writer who was a teenage partisan during the war the propagandist use to which it was later put  when the gdr was still in the eastern bloc citizens were forced to watch this to warn them of another rise of fascism  does not impair its effect today at all it echoes intensity found in another masterpiece by the director klimovs shorter larissa  is a remorseful elegy to his late wife poetic and very personal its sense of shock anticipates the heightened anguish that ultimately reverberates through come and see through his images the director stares uncomprehendingly at a world where lives are removed cruelly and without reason if on this occasion not just one but thousandsat the heart of the narrative is floyra both viewer and victim of the appalling events making up the films narrative his history a horrendous comingofage story it begins with him laboriously digging out a weapon to use and much changed at the end he finally uses one as he travels from initial innocence through devastating experience on to stunned hatred in a remarkable process he ages before our eyes both inside and out his fresh face grows perceptibly more haggard as the film progresses frequently staring straight back at the camera as if challenging the viewer to keep watching or while holding his numbed head apparently close to mental collapse often shot directly at the boy or from his point of view the formal quality of klimovs film owes something to tarkovskys use of the camera in ivans childhood although the context is entirely differentthe films title is from the book of revelations referring to the summoning of witnesses to the devastation brought by the four horsemen of the apocalypse come and see is an invitation for its youthful protagonist to arm up and investigate the war but also one for the audience to tread a similarly terrible path witnessing with vivid immediacy the belorussion holocaust at close hand here the intensity of what is on offer justifies amplification by the use of a travelling camera pointofview shots and some startlingly surreal effects pointing up unnatural events the small animal clinging nervously to the german commanders arm for instance soundtrack distortions or the mock hitler sculpted out of clay and skullmain character floyra is the directors witness to events a horrified visitor forced like us to see  even if full comprehension understandably follows more slowly for instance during their return to the village there is some doubt as to if floyra is yet or will be ever able to fully acknowledge the nature of surrounding events in one of the most disturbing scenes out of a film full of them glashas reaction to offscreen smells and sights is profoundly blithe and unsettling so much so we wonder for a brief while if the youngsters really know what is going on its a watershed of innocence one look back as the two leave and the reality of the situation would surely overwhelm floyra  just as later more explicit horrors do the viewercome and see was not an easy shoot it lasted over nine months and during the course of the action the young cast were called upon to perform some unpleasant tasks including at one point wading up to their necks through a freezing swamp kravchenkos face is unforgettable during this and other experiences and there are claims that he was hypnotised in order to simulate the proper degree of shell shock during one of the major early sequences the sonic distortion created on the soundtrack at this point later appeared to a lesser extent in spielbergs saving private ryan as did elements of a muchcommented scene where a cow is caught in murderous crossfire klimovs camera ranges through and around the atrocities although one doubts that a steady cam was available by the end florya is isolated from humanity technically as well as mentally by a striking shot that excludes the middle foreground disturbingly expressionistic though these scenes are others such as the scene where florya and the partisan girl rose visit the forest after the bombing achieve an eerie lyricism that are however entirely missing from the hollywood production and whereas

innocence through devastating experience on to stunned hatred in a remarkable process he ages before our eyes both inside and out his fresh face grows perceptibly more haggard as the film progresses frequently staring straight back at the camera as if challenging the viewer to keep watching or while holding his numbed head apparently close to mental collapse often shot directly at the boy or from his point of view the formal quality of klimovs film owes something to tarkovskys use of the camera in ivans childhood although the context is entirely differentthe films title is from the book of revelations referring to the summoning of witnesses to the devastation brought by the four horsemen of the apocalypse come and see is an invitation for its youthful protagonist to arm up and investigate the war but also one for the audience to tread a similarly terrible path witnessing with vivid immediacy the belorussion holocaust at close hand here the intensity of what is on offer

commanders arm for instance soundtrack distortions or the mock hitler sculpted out of clay and skullmain character floyra is the directors witness to events a horrified visitor forced like us to see  even if full comprehension understandably follows more slowly for instance during their return to the village there is some doubt as to if floyra is yet or will be ever able to fully acknowledge the nature of surrounding events in one of the most disturbing scenes out of a film full of them glashas reaction to offscreen smells and sights is profoundly blithe and unsettling so much so we wonder for a brief while if the youngsters really know what is going on its a watershed of innocence one look back as the two leave and the reality of the situation would surely overwhelm floyra  just as later more explicit horrors do the viewercome and see was not an easy shoot it lasted over nine months and during the course of the action the young cast were called upon to perform some unpleasant tasks including at one point wading up to their necks through a freezing swamp kravchenkos face is unforgettable during this and other experiences and there are claims that he was hypnotised in order to simulate the proper degree of shell shock during one of the major early sequences the sonic distortion created on the soundtrack at this point later appeared to a lesser extent in spielbergs saving private ryan as did elements of a muchcommented scene where a cow is caught in murderous crossfire klimovs camera ranges through and around the atrocities although one doubts that a steady cam was available by the end florya is isolated from humanity technically as well as mentally by a striking shot that excludes the middle foreground disturbingly expressionistic though these scenes are others such as the scene where florya and the partisan girl rose visit the forest after the bombing achieve an eerie lyricism that are however entirely missing from the hollywood production and whereas spielbergs work concludes with a dramatic irony thats perhaps a little too neat contrived for different audience tastes klimovs less accommodating epic finishes on a unique cathartic moment  no doubt partly chosen to avoid any bathos after events just witnessed but one which sends real blame back generationshallucinatory heartrending traumatic and uncompromising such a movie will not to be all tastes it certainly does not make for relaxing viewing although those who see it often say it remains with them for years after this was klimovs last film for as he said afterwards i lost interest in making films everything that was possible i felt had already been done no doubt referring to the emotional intensity of his masterpiece which would be hard to top by the end of their own viewing any audience ought to be shocked enough to pick up a rifle themselves and vengefully join the home army setting out to fight the great patriotic war  a necessarily stalwart response without limit of participation symbolised by the director who tracks a camera through the dense forest before finally rejoining a column of soldiers heading to the front if you feel like i do that any real war film

"1207","the boat (1981)","review of the directors cut","theo robertson","while it has been a very long time since i have seen this movie it is one of the very few that i own wolfgang petersens magnificent accomplishment in das boot is reiterating the dictum that war is hell no matter which side you look at it from and no matter where the battlefield is located minor spoilers the plot has been well described by other viewers so i wont rehash it again but my personal observations as an exsubmarine sailor are that petersen probably portrayed life on board the sub pretty accurately i say probably because todays subs are hotels compared with the german uboats and american submarines the commonality between yesterday and today is how the crew deals with being closed up in a sewer pipe for weeks at a time more importantly you as a viewer become an invisible crew member as the crew lives in very cramped conditions american ww subs used to be called pig boats deals with an unfortunately believable political officer deals with drills actual torpedo firings actual ships casualties and deals most frighteningly with retribution from the enemy my own experience watching the depth charging of the uboat was such that i was thinking stop it stop it stop it stopitstopitstopit thats how real it felt to me for the rest of you i feel certain you will too be dragged in and know what it is like to live on board a ww uboatthis movie also shows how leadership is so important in keeping the crew and ultimately the sub together petersens direction for captain lehmannwillenbrock was masterful because it didnt portray the captain as a god it showed him as a man who knows how to lead knows his submarine as if he were married to it and in many ways he is but isnt perfect at the job it also shows that even with great leadership qualities captain lehmannwillenbrock can not do the job alone he must have both officers and enlisted men who have the knowledge and skill to not just do their jobs but to also advise the captain petersen also managed to give each member of the crew their own separate personalities instead of the predictable cookiecutter personalities that hollywood feels is neededi could go on and on so i will close by saying that with the plot direction cinematography acting sound music editing all being top notch this is one of the few movies that i can truly rate a  out of  i also preferred the german version with subtitles i believe that this movie was either the first or one of the first to use steadicam technology it was truly amazing for me to see a camera zip its way through a submarine specifically through the open watertight doors without a break in the filming up until i heard what steadicam was i was always wondering how petersen managed to hide the camera dolly track or the wires the camera hung fromit turns out i was wrong bound for glory was the firstedit  oct  i have been corrected by an observant viewer wikipedia has the following comment on what i thought was steadicam usagemost of the interior shots were filmed using a handheld arriflex of cinematographer jost vacanos design to convey the claustrophobic atmosphere of the boat it had a gyroscope to provide stability a reinvention of the steadicam on a smaller scale so that it could be carried throughout the interior of the mockup vacano wore fullbody padding to minimize injury as he ran and the mockup was rocked and shaken so literally a steadicam was not used in the filming of das boot however a camera that resembled steadicam in function in the way it gyroscopically leveled the filming platform was used even though todays submarines are far cleaner then their predecessors and we have refrigerators freezers air conditioning are able to take showers etc there is one aspect of living in an enclosed space that still lives on the smell while the smell of the pig boats of ww was truly atrocious even with todays ability to clean the atmosphere you can not escape the fact that any smell that is created from burned toast in the galley from the smell of the sanitary gasses to be kind to gasified hydraulic oil and diesel fuel all these particulates will eventually become absorbed in your clothing you as a sailor may get used to it but when you get home your wife will most likely declare that you smell like a submarine and demand that whatever you are wearing get thrown in the wash  immediately",2004-08-18,NA

"1227","the boat (1981)","review of the directors cut","theo robertson","while it has been a very long time since i have seen this movie it is one of the very few that i own wolfgang petersens magnificent accomplishment in das boot is reiterating the dictum that war is hell no matter which side you look at it from and no matter where the battlefield is located minor spoilers the plot has been well described by other viewers so i wont rehash it again but my personal observations as an exsubmarine sailor are that petersen probably portrayed life on board the sub pretty accurately i say probably because todays subs are hotels compared with the german uboats and american submarines the commonality between yesterday and today is how the crew deals with being closed up in a sewer pipe for weeks at a time more importantly you as a viewer become an invisible crew member as the crew lives in very cramped conditions american ww subs used to be called pig boats deals with an unfortunately believable political officer deals with drills actual torpedo firings actual ships casualties and deals most frighteningly with retribution from the enemy my own experience watching the depth charging of the uboat was such that i was thinking stop it stop it stop it stopitstopitstopit thats how real it felt to me for the rest of you i feel certain you will too be dragged in and know what it is like to live on board a ww uboatthis movie also shows how leadership is so important in keeping the crew and ultimately the sub together petersens direction for captain lehmannwillenbrock was masterful because it didnt portray the captain as a god it showed him as a man who knows how to lead knows his submarine as if he were married to it and in many ways he is but isnt perfect at the job it also shows that even with great leadership qualities captain lehmannwillenbrock can not do the job alone he must have both officers and enlisted men who have the knowledge and skill to not just do their jobs but to also advise the captain petersen also managed to give each member of the crew their own separate personalities instead of the predictable cookiecutter personalities that hollywood feels is neededi could go on and on so i will close by saying that with the plot direction cinematography acting sound music editing all being top notch this is one of the few movies that i can truly rate a  out of  i also preferred the german version with subtitles i believe that this movie was either the first or one of the first to use steadicam technology it was truly amazing for me to see a camera zip its way through a submarine specifically through the open watertight doors without a break in the filming up until i heard what steadicam was i was always wondering how petersen managed to hide the camera dolly track or the wires the camera hung fromit turns out i was wrong bound for glory was the firstedit  oct  i have been corrected by an observant viewer wikipedia has the following comment on what i thought was steadicam usagemost of the interior shots were filmed using a handheld arriflex of cinematographer jost vacanos design to convey the claustrophobic atmosphere of the boat it had a gyroscope to provide stability a reinvention of the steadicam on a smaller scale so that it could be carried throughout the interior of the mockup vacano wore fullbody padding to minimize injury as he ran and the mockup was rocked and shaken so literally a steadicam was not used in the filming of das boot however a camera that resembled steadicam in function in the way it gyroscopically leveled the filming platform was used even though todays submarines are far cleaner then their predecessors and we have refrigerators freezers air conditioning are able to take showers etc there is one aspect of living in an enclosed space that still lives on the smell while the smell of the pig boats of ww was truly atrocious even with todays ability to clean the atmosphere you can not escape the fact that any smell that is created from burned toast in the galley from the smell of the sanitary gasses to be kind to gasified hydraulic oil and diesel fuel all these particulates will eventually become absorbed in your clothing you as a sailor may get used to it but when you get home your wife will most likely declare that you smell like a submarine and demand that whatever you are wearing get thrown in the wash  immediately",2004-08-18,NA
"1228","the boat (1981)"," years and im still thinking about it","susy","this is touted as one of the best wwii submarine films of all time and its not difficult to understand why from the story to the cast from the cinematography to the sound everythings top notch on this german film directed by wolfgang petersen whos now helming more hollywood flicks id rate it above u k the widowmaker crimson tide and the hunt for red octoberwe follow the exploits of the crew of german uboat u as it gets sent on its mission to destroy allied convoys we learn of the frustrations of inaction having no targets and living the lonely life aboard a submarine we experience the claustrophobic environment one which is shared amongst crew where maintaining hygiene and tolerable living conditions is of the utmost importance of staying well we pick up on the fear of the captain about his inexperienced crew most of whom were in their early twenties and havent seen much action in the high seaswhats gripping in this film is when things start to pick up technology those days arent as advanced and we see that uboats are more likely to be sitting ducks when allied destroyers hover above them on the waters surface dropping multiple depth charges to rattle and hopefully destroy their underwater prey the uboat is the hunter but once it has hunted it becomes the preyand such is the marvellous depiction of fear in the crews eyes as they huddle in silence each time the enemy lurks above the suspense literally keeps you at the edge of your seat the silence deafening many set action pieces bring out the different scenarios and challenges that the crew face in their voyage on the seas and all these capped by the beautiful soundtrack which accompanies each scene my favourite was the charge through gilbrataralthough this movie takes on an axis powers point of view one can discard the political aspect of this film and understand that lives on both ends are similar  each are fathers brothers husbands and are thrown into a senseless political war it doesnt go preachy on whos right and wrong but touches on more human and basic issues of survival boys become men and it is this transformation that is most obvious throughout the storyif youve got the chance you must see the directors cut running at about  minutes just as wolfgang petersen envisioned it to be excellent stuff",1999-09-08,NA

"1237","the boat (1981)","review of the directors cut","theo robertson","while it has been a very long time since i have seen this movie it is one of the very few that i own wolfgang petersens magnificent accomplishment in das boot is reiterating the dictum that war is hell no matter which side you look at it from and no matter where the battlefield is located minor spoilers the plot has been well described by other viewers so i wont rehash it again but my personal observations as an exsubmarine sailor are that petersen probably portrayed life on board the sub pretty accurately i say probably because todays subs are hotels compared with the german uboats and american submarines the commonality between yesterday and today is how the crew deals with being closed up in a sewer pipe for weeks at a time more importantly you as a viewer become an invisible crew member as the crew lives in very cramped conditions american ww subs used to be called pig boats deals with an unfortunately believable political officer deals with drills actual torpedo firings actual ships casualties and deals most frighteningly with retribution from the enemy my own experience watching the depth charging of the uboat was such that i was thinking stop it stop it stop it stopitstopitstopit thats how real it felt to me for the rest of you i feel certain you will too be dragged in and know what it is like to live on board a ww uboatthis movie also shows how leadership is so important in keeping the crew and ultimately the sub together petersens direction for captain lehmannwillenbrock was masterful because it didnt portray the captain as a god it showed him as a man who knows how to lead knows his submarine as if he were married to it and in many ways he is but isnt perfect at the job it also shows that even with great leadership qualities captain lehmannwillenbrock can not do the job alone he must have both officers and enlisted men who have the knowledge and skill to not just do their jobs but to also advise the captain petersen also managed to give each member of the crew their own separate personalities instead of the predictable cookiecutter personalities that hollywood feels is neededi could go on and on so i will close by saying that with the plot direction cinematography acting sound music editing all being top notch this is one of the few movies that i can truly rate a  out of  i also preferred the german version with subtitles i believe that this movie was either the first or one of the first to use steadicam technology it was truly amazing for me to see a camera zip its way through a submarine specifically through the open watertight doors without a break in the filming up until i heard what steadicam was i was always wondering how petersen managed to hide the camera dolly track or the wires the camera hung fromit turns out i was wrong bound for glory was the firstedit  oct  i have been corrected by an observant viewer wikipedia has the following comment on what i thought was steadicam usagemost of the interior shots were filmed using a handheld arriflex of cinematographer jost vacanos design to convey the claustrophobic atmosphere of the boat it had a gyroscope to provide stability a reinvention of the steadicam on a smaller scale so that it could be carried throughout the interior of the mockup vacano wore fullbody padding to minimize injury as he ran and the mockup was rocked and shaken so literally a steadicam was not used in the filming of das boot however a camera that resembled steadicam in function in the way it gyroscopically leveled the filming platform was used even though todays submarines are far cleaner then their predecessors and we have refrigerators freezers air conditioning are able to take showers etc there is one aspect of living in an enclosed space that still lives on the smell while the smell of the pig boats of ww was truly atrocious even with todays ability to clean the atmosphere you can not escape the fact that any smell that is created from burned toast in the galley from the smell of the sanitary gasses to be kind to gasified hydraulic oil and diesel fuel all these particulates will eventually become absorbed in your clothing you as a sailor may get used to it but when you get home your wife will most likely declare that you smell like a submarine and demand that whatever you are wearing get thrown in the wash  immediately",2004-08-18,NA

complete works are available on dvd and he is the perfect candidate for this project having worked with kaufman before on the  flop human nature it seems that he has finally found a unique directing style that ties in perfectly with the underlying themes of the moviethere is a very deep message in sunshine and it is arguably kaufmans deepest film to date love and romance and memories of both have rarely been examined as thoughtprovokingly and tenderly as they are in this wonderful motion picture the movie has a very profound message that all viewers should pay attention to there are many small intricacies in the film surely picked up on more thoroughly on repeat viewings and the entire construction of the movie is completely enthralling and intelligent i saw two people leave the rather empty theater during the screening i attended it tanked in the us and i predict it will do the same in the uk which is a shame because this is the smartest film of  and has the most to say about our lives than any other film this year while everyone flocks to see the new denzel washington action movie eternal sunshine of the spotless mind is forgotten which is quite depressing  people would rather spend their money on forgettable entertainment than view something unique that has something important at its corei think what the movie finally asks us after its long emotional journey is would we want our own memories erased and if so what would the consequences be a lesser film might examine this idea poorly  sunshine is not it is perfect in almost every conceivable way and anyone who complains that it is not original must be joking  in my entire lifetime this is one of the most unique film experiences i have ever hadeternal sunshine of the spotless mind is a beautiful movie

"1908","scarface (1983)","the s and how not to live them","lambiepie","in  director brian de palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an american gangster and that he did with the help of a terrific screenplay by oliver stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast the result was scarface starring al pacino in one of his most memorable roles  the story begins in may of  when castro opened the harbor at mariel cuba to allow cuban nationals to join their families in the united states   left cuba at that time for the greener pastures of freedom in america and most were honest hardworking people thankful for the opportunity they had been granted  but not all  among the marielitos who streamed into florida approximately  had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of cubas jails criminals considered beyond redemption who castro had merely wanted to be rid of  and they too saw america as a land of opportunity even as al capone had considered chicago some fifty years earlier  and among the most ambitious was a man named tony montana pacino known to his associates as caracortada scarfacenow that he was free of the yoke of communism under which he had grown up montana wanted what he felt was coming to him and he wanted it now and from the moment he stepped off the boat in florida he was determined to have it all  wealth and power that was montanas dream and he would get it by doing what he did best beginning with a favor for a man living in miami by the name of frank lopez robert loggia  lopez it seems had a brother in cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of castros goons a man who having outlived his usefulness to castro had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in little havana along with montana and all of the cubans just off the boats where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives  and in short order montana sees to it that lopezs brother has been avenged and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of americalopez a wealthy businessman with the right connections in return for the favor gets montana and his friend manny steven bauer released from the holding camp and puts them to work  in his day capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain but lopez has the modern day equivalent and its even more lucrative cocaine  lopez takes montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life but once he has a taste of it montana isnt satisfied with whatever crumbs lopez sees fit to throw his way and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be  at the top  with a coldblooded iron will montana decides hell do whatever it takes to get there no matter what the cost  but before its over he will realize the price for his dream and hell pay it but for a brief moment perhaps he will know what its like to be the man  and he will also know whether or not it was worth itin step with de palmas vision pacino plays montana largerthanlife and he does it beautifully  from the accent he affects which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right and he did to the body language and the attitude hes got it all and it makes montana convincing and very real  what he brings to the role is nuance and style in a way that few actors de niro would be one can  this is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way nor is there anything about montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level but pacinos screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character even though its hard to become emotionally involved with him  its quite simply a dynamic memorable performancemichelle pfeiffer gives a solid performance as well in the role that put her on the path to stardom  as elvira the woman who becomes an integral part of montanas dream pfeiffer is subtle and understated giving that sense of something going on underneath while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance  she like pacino definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic enigmatic and sultry demeanorthe supporting cast includes mary elizabeth mastrantonio gina miriam colon mama montana f murray abraham omar paul shenar sosa and harris yulin bernstein  an excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed traffic and blow and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of peckinpahs the wild bunch de palmas scarface originally panned by critics has since been cited by many as being the definitive american gangster saga  much of the violence is implied rather than graphic but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing  but if you stay with it there is a lesson to be learned in the end  and like many lessons in life the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time  but the reward is always worth it and thats the way it is with this film  i rate this one ",2003-06-22,NA
"1909","scarface (1983)","dynamic performance by pacino","jhclues","one of the most recognized quote from a movie ever even to those who havent seen the movie its sort of pacinos equivalent to de niro you talkin to me scene from taxi driver not comparing those movies of course if you want to compare movies you could compare this to the s original with paul muni a movie that pacino watched in a cinema and made him want this movie made him want to be as mesmerizing and have a powerful role add oliver stone and others to make this happen and you have an amazing movienow at the time it was released people were disgusted by this thinking of tony montana as role model or maybe fearing he could be just that and he has become a cultural influence and to some an idol the movie did not intend it or the character to be viewed as such you cant blame the movie for how people reflect and adapt to what they seeyou can blame the critics for not giving it enough credit while the original set a standard and was used as a rough blueprint some scenes are reminiscent of the original this did many original things that we had not seen before like a chainsaw scene so not for the squeamish or the ones who are easily offended all that taken into account it is a travesty pacino did not win an oscar for his performance its an even bigger travesty he wasnt even nominated actually the movie had even a razzie nomination  which is almost funny while simultanously sad toothe movie may be long but it needs time to unfold it is bigger than life has many tips of the hat to the original the world is yours and might be one of the few cases where the remake is at least as good as the original highly recommended to anyone who loves action movies and dramas combined",2001-06-30,NA

some fifty years earlier  and among the most ambitious was a man named tony montana pacino known to his associates as caracortada scarfacenow that he was free of the yoke of communism under which he had grown up montana wanted what he felt was coming to him and he wanted it now and from the moment he stepped off the boat in florida he was determined to have it all  wealth and power that was montanas dream and he would get it by doing what he did best beginning with a favor for a man living in miami by the name of frank lopez robert loggia  lopez it seems had a brother in cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of castros goons a man who having outlived his usefulness to castro had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in little havana along with montana and all of the cubans just off the boats where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives  and in short order montana sees to it that lopezs

friend manny steven bauer released from the holding camp and puts them to work  in his day capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain but lopez has

"1938","scarface (1983)","the s and how not to live them","lambiepie","in  director brian de palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an american gangster and that he did with the help of a terrific screenplay by oliver stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast the result was scarface starring al pacino in one of his most memorable roles  the story begins in may of  when castro opened the harbor at mariel cuba to allow cuban nationals to join their families in the united states   left cuba at that time for the greener pastures of freedom in america and most were honest hardworking people thankful for the opportunity they had been granted  but not all  among the marielitos who streamed into florida approximately  had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of cubas jails criminals considered beyond redemption who castro had merely wanted to be rid of  and they too saw america as a land of opportunity even as al capone had considered chicago some fifty years earlier  and among the most ambitious was a man named tony montana pacino known to his associates as caracortada scarfacenow that he was free of the yoke of communism under which he had grown up montana wanted what he felt was coming to him and he wanted it now and from the moment he stepped off the boat in florida he was determined to have it all  wealth and power that was montanas dream and he would get it by doing what he did best beginning with a favor for a man living in miami by the name of frank lopez robert loggia  lopez it seems had a brother in cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of castros goons a man who having outlived his usefulness to castro had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in little havana along with montana and all of the cubans just off the boats where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives  and in short order montana sees to it that lopezs brother has been avenged and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of americalopez a wealthy businessman with the right connections in return for the favor gets montana and his friend manny steven bauer released from the holding camp and puts them to work  in his day capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain but lopez has the modern day equivalent and its even more lucrative cocaine  lopez takes montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life but once he has a taste of it montana isnt satisfied with whatever crumbs lopez sees fit to throw his way and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be  at the top  with a coldblooded iron will montana decides hell do whatever it takes to get there no matter what the cost  but before its over he will realize the price for his dream and hell pay it but for a brief moment perhaps he will know what its like to be the man  and he will also know whether or not it was worth itin step with de palmas vision pacino plays montana largerthanlife and he does it beautifully  from the accent he affects which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right and he did to the body language and the attitude hes got it all and it makes montana convincing and very real  what he brings to the role is nuance and style in a way that few actors de niro would be one can  this is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way nor is there anything about montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level but pacinos screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character even though its hard to become emotionally involved with him  its quite simply a dynamic memorable performancemichelle pfeiffer gives a solid performance as well in the role that put her on the path to stardom  as elvira the woman who becomes an integral part of montanas dream pfeiffer is subtle and understated giving that sense of something going on underneath while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance  she like pacino definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic enigmatic and sultry demeanorthe supporting cast includes mary elizabeth mastrantonio gina miriam colon mama montana f murray abraham omar paul shenar sosa and harris yulin bernstein  an excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed traffic and blow and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of peckinpahs the wild bunch de palmas scarface originally panned by critics has since been cited by many as being the definitive american gangster saga  much of the violence is implied rather than graphic but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing  but if you stay with it there is a lesson to be learned in the end  and like many lessons in life the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time  but the reward is always worth it and thats the way it is with this film  i rate this one ",2003-06-22,NA

"1948","scarface (1983)","the s and how not to live them","lambiepie","in  director brian de palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an american gangster and that he did with the help of a terrific screenplay by oliver stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast the result was scarface starring al pacino in one of his most memorable roles  the story begins in may of  when castro opened the harbor at mariel cuba to allow cuban nationals to join their families in the united states   left cuba at that time for the greener pastures of freedom in america and most were honest hardworking people thankful for the opportunity they had been granted  but not all  among the marielitos who streamed into florida approximately  had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of cubas jails criminals considered beyond redemption who castro had merely wanted to be rid of  and they too saw america as a land of opportunity even as al capone had considered chicago some fifty years earlier  and among the most ambitious was a man named tony montana pacino known to his associates as caracortada scarfacenow that he was free of the yoke of communism under which he had grown up montana wanted what he felt was coming to him and he wanted it now and from the moment he stepped off the boat in florida he was determined to have it all  wealth and power that was montanas dream and he would get it by doing what he did best beginning with a favor for a man living in miami by the name of frank lopez robert loggia  lopez it seems had a brother in cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of castros goons a man who having outlived his usefulness to castro had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in little havana along with montana and all of the cubans just off the boats where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives  and in short order montana sees to it that lopezs brother has been avenged and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of americalopez a wealthy businessman with the right connections in return for the favor gets montana and his friend manny steven bauer released from the holding camp and puts them to work  in his day capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain but lopez has the modern day equivalent and its even more lucrative cocaine  lopez takes montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life but once he has a taste of it montana isnt satisfied with whatever crumbs lopez sees fit to throw his way and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be  at the top  with a coldblooded iron will montana decides hell do whatever it takes to get there no matter what the cost  but before its over he will realize the price for his dream and hell pay it but for a brief moment perhaps he will know what its like to be the man  and he will also know whether or not it was worth itin step with de palmas vision pacino plays montana largerthanlife and he does it beautifully  from the accent he affects which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right and he did to the body language and the attitude hes got it all and it makes montana convincing and very real  what he brings to the role is nuance and style in a way that few actors de niro would be one can  this is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way nor is there anything about montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level but pacinos screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character even though its hard to become emotionally involved with him  its quite simply a dynamic memorable performancemichelle pfeiffer gives a solid performance as well in the role that put her on the path to stardom  as elvira the woman who becomes an integral part of montanas dream pfeiffer is subtle and understated giving that sense of something going on underneath while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance  she like pacino definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic enigmatic and sultry demeanorthe supporting cast includes mary elizabeth mastrantonio gina miriam colon mama montana f murray abraham omar paul shenar sosa and harris yulin bernstein  an excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed traffic and blow and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of peckinpahs the wild bunch de palmas scarface originally panned by critics has since been cited by many as being the definitive american gangster saga  much of the violence is implied rather than graphic but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing  but if you stay with it there is a lesson to be learned in the end  and like many lessons in life the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time  but the reward is always worth it and thats the way it is with this film  i rate this one ",2003-06-22,NA

this idea the former balloon salesman ties thousands of balloons to his house and simply floats away en route to his dream adventure except he is not alone  young wilderness explorer russell jordan nagai inadvertently shows up in midair and carl sees no other choice but to bring the boy with himthe fact that this plot line is even relevant enough to get made into a movie is more than enough reason to praise up ever since toy story pixar has consistently delivered the most radically original and unique ideas for animated films and live action films sure not all of them are as amazing as others cars is quite simply stale compared to the likes of ratatouille and walle but there is something brilliantly imaginative and exciting going on at the studio and up is no exceptioncoming off the breakthrough of walle i was not expecting the same reaction to up but i was more than just pleasantly surprised the film is hilarious heartfelt moving and depressing all at once this may sound like it is an issue and that the film has a problem holding its ground with its tonal structure but instead it handles it quite well splitting the film into quadrants and allowing the themes and plot line to coincide with whatever emotional response the filmmakers are going for and while there is plenty for young children to enjoy and take from the film it is the older audience that will get the biggest reaction from it there is a lot going on in the film but it never loses its speed and never loses control of what it wants to say and do it knows exactly where it wants to be and when and where other recent pixar films have failed specifically in their lengthy runtimes and frequent need to drag themselves out up does not it practically blasts its way through its beginning all the way up to its ending with time left to sparewhat makes up work so well much like walle before it is the focus on very few characters where walle spent the majority of its runtime primarily on earth with its main character a love interest and a cockroach up spends its majority with carl russell a bird named kevin and a talking dog named dug voiced by codirector bob peterson it does allow for more characters to enter in later on but the focus never strays from these main characters some may say the film is trying to tell multiple stories but as the film progresses it is clear it is telling one story  the tale of a man who never experienced what he wanted the most the film builds up carls backstory heavily in startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive in the marketing for the film we know from the very first trailer that carl is a fairly mean old man but the film spends a great deal of time to develop him into an emotional wreck of a manbut the real success of the film is in its imagination and adventure while walle is perhaps the most startlingly unique and original animated picture of the last decade up still manages to pack in a lot of uniqueness but while walle got caught up in its own environmentally sound message up sticks with being an almost straight adventure picture it is frequently thrilling and exciting and lets up only for a few moments at a time for such an older character the film really stuns with some of its fantastical ideas sure it is obvious this is a film that could only ever be done as an animated film but what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun  something that has been sorely missing from the movies for years it came back for a short while with the first pirates of the caribbean film but the focus as of late for any film has been on deeply conflicted depressing narratives and while this film is struck with having some of the most depressing scenes the year has seen so far it never wallows in the sadness it throws the moments at you and then quickly moves on and as said previously the tonal shifts work excellently in ups favourbut of course an animated movie cannot work without its animation while up is not a breakthrough in the way other pixar films have been it keeps with the tradition of still looking stunning and leading the curve for computer animated films it does look cartoony and fantastical in many instances but this only continues to work towards it being even better the locales are realistic looking the dog fur is near perfect for me watching carls facial hair gradually grow in as the story moves along was simply amazing the little details and minute perfections have always been key to the pixar films and up is no different additionally the d effects really add a layer to the film and bring the movie to life unlike other recent efforts like monsters vs aliens and bolti cannot praise up enough words cannot do justice for how excellent the film is pixar continues to outdo itself year after year even with their subpar films while each film has their own flaws up revels in being as close to perfect as the company has been in years i adored every minute

this idea the former balloon salesman ties thousands of balloons to his house and simply floats away en route to his dream adventure except he is not alone  young wilderness explorer russell jordan nagai inadvertently shows up in midair and carl sees no other choice but to bring the boy with himthe fact that this plot line is even relevant enough to get made into a movie is more than enough reason to praise up ever since toy story pixar has consistently delivered the most radically original and unique ideas for animated films and live action films sure not all of them are as amazing as others cars is quite simply stale compared to the likes of ratatouille and walle but there is something brilliantly imaginative and exciting going on at the studio and up is no exceptioncoming off the breakthrough of walle i was not expecting the same reaction to up but i was more than just pleasantly surprised the film is hilarious heartfelt moving and depressing all at once this may sound like it is an issue and that the film has a problem holding its ground with its tonal structure but instead it handles it quite well splitting the film into quadrants and allowing the themes and plot line to coincide with whatever emotional response the filmmakers are going for and while there is plenty for young children to enjoy and take from the film it is the older audience that will get the biggest reaction from it there is a lot going on in the film but it never loses its speed and never loses control of what it wants to say and do it knows exactly where it wants to be and when and where other recent pixar films have failed specifically in their lengthy runtimes and frequent need to drag themselves out up does not it practically blasts its way through its beginning all the way up to its ending with time left to sparewhat makes up work so well much like walle before it is the focus on very few characters where walle spent the majority of its runtime primarily on earth with its main character a love interest and a cockroach up spends its majority with carl russell a bird named kevin and a talking dog named dug voiced by codirector bob peterson it does allow for more characters to enter in later on but the focus never strays from these main characters some may say the film is trying to tell multiple stories but as the film progresses it is clear it is telling one story  the tale of a man who never experienced what he wanted the most the film builds up carls backstory heavily in startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive in the marketing for the film we know from the very first trailer that carl is a fairly mean old man but the film spends a great deal of time to develop him into an emotional wreck of a manbut the real success of the film is in its imagination and adventure while walle is perhaps the most startlingly unique and original animated picture of the last decade up still manages to pack in a lot of uniqueness but while walle got caught up in its own environmentally sound message up sticks with being an almost straight adventure picture it is frequently thrilling and exciting and lets up only for a few moments at a time for such an older character the film really stuns with some of its fantastical ideas sure it is obvious this is a film that could only ever be done as an animated film but what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun  something that has been sorely missing from the movies for years it came back for a short while with the first pirates of the caribbean film but the focus as of late for any film has been on deeply conflicted depressing narratives and while this film is struck with having some of the most depressing scenes the year has seen so far it never wallows in the sadness it throws the moments at you and then quickly moves on and as said previously the tonal shifts work excellently in ups favourbut of course an animated movie cannot work without its animation while up is not a breakthrough in the way other pixar films have been it keeps with the tradition of still looking stunning and leading the curve for computer animated films it does look cartoony and fantastical in many instances but this only continues to work towards it being even better the locales are realistic looking the dog fur is near perfect for me watching carls facial hair

nagai inadvertently shows up in midair and carl sees no other choice but to bring the boy with himthe fact that this plot line is even relevant enough to get made into a movie is more than enough reason to praise up ever since toy story pixar has consistently delivered the most radically original and unique ideas for animated films and live action films sure not all of them are as amazing as others cars is quite simply stale compared to the likes of ratatouille and walle but there is something brilliantly imaginative and exciting going on at the studio and up is no exceptioncoming off the breakthrough of walle i was not expecting the same reaction to up but i was more than just pleasantly surprised the film is hilarious heartfelt moving and depressing all at once this may sound like it is an issue and that the film has a problem holding its ground with its tonal structure but instead it handles it quite well splitting the film into quadrants and allowing the themes and plot line to coincide with whatever emotional response the filmmakers are going for and while there is plenty for young children to enjoy and take from the film it is the older audience that will get the biggest reaction from it there is a lot going on in the film but it never loses its speed and never loses control of what it wants to say and do it knows exactly where it wants to be and when and where other recent pixar films have failed specifically in their lengthy runtimes and frequent need to drag themselves out up does not it practically blasts its way through its beginning all the way up to its ending with time left to sparewhat makes up work so well much like walle before it is the focus on very few characters where walle spent the majority of its runtime primarily on earth with its main character a love interest and a cockroach up spends its majority with carl russell a bird named kevin and a talking dog named dug voiced by codirector bob peterson it does allow for more characters to enter in later on but the focus never strays from these main characters some may say the film is trying to tell multiple stories but as the film progresses it is clear it is telling one story  the tale of a man who never experienced what he wanted the most the film builds up carls backstory heavily in startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive in the marketing for the film we know from the very first trailer that carl is a fairly mean old man but the film spends a great deal of time to develop him into an emotional wreck of a manbut the real success of the film is in its imagination and adventure while walle is perhaps the most startlingly unique and original animated picture of the last decade up still manages to pack in a lot of uniqueness but while walle got caught up in its own environmentally sound message up sticks with being an almost straight adventure picture it is frequently thrilling and exciting and lets up only for a few moments at a time for such an older character the film really stuns with some of its fantastical ideas sure it is obvious this is a film that could only ever be done as an animated film but what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun  something that has been sorely missing from the movies for years it came back for a short while with the first pirates of the caribbean film but the focus as of late for any film has been on deeply conflicted depressing narratives and while this film is struck with having some of the most depressing scenes the year has seen so far it never wallows in the sadness it throws the moments at you and then quickly moves on and as said previously the tonal shifts work excellently in ups favourbut of course an animated movie cannot work without its

case of the wizard of oz its hard to imagine anyone who might not have seen it at some point in their lives almost everyone you talk to has a memory of their first experience the reason this movie remains the most beloved of hollywood films even after six decades is because the wizard of oz is unique among motion pictures in that it mirrors our longings and imaginations as children the movie in front of and behind the scenes has become movie folklore we love the legends about the rotating directors from george cukor to king vidor to victor fleming we know the legend of buddy ebsen who had to drop out due to an allergic reaction to the tin man makeup and margaret hamilton whose dress caught fire and nearly had her face burned off because of the copperbased makeup we love stories about the problems on the set between personal feuds sweltering costumes partying munchkins and the costume designer who had to keep up with judy garlands developing bust line theres even a spurious legend of a ghost on the set all of these elements make the wizard of oz a much bigger legend than it already it but thats okay because this is the one movie that deserves to be overhyped it occupies such a large part of our memories that we want to make it more than it is to just have one more reason to make it more than a movie we want it to be a life experiencethat experience is brought to us because we are intimately familiar with its story elements the dreams that dorothy sings about and the adventure that follows seem to mirror our yearnings as children she imagines a bigger place where her problems dont linger and she is free to explore them she imagines a place where there isnt any trouble and people actually listen to what she has to say she sees the rainbow as her golden gate to a better place because in her drab kansas world the rainbow is the only source of color that she knows she dreams of a bigger place and imagines a world where troubles melt like lemondrops we can relate how many of us as kids sat in our room or in our yards and played imagining a place to go and characters to interact with a colorful world bigger than our small confined worlds oz is meant to represent the colorful palette of our imagination but for dorothy it is also a place where she does some growing up the three friends that she meets along the way the scarecrow the tin man and the lion are emblematic of the lessons of bravery love and devotion and the ability to think for ourselves the wicked witch of the west certainly represents the real dangers along the way for dorothy there is a matronly figure glinda the good witch who intends for dorothy to discover for herself how to solve her problems she knows that dorothy must grow up along the way in a way she seems to represent the parent that dorothy doesnt have back in kansas her aunt and uncle love her but this was a movie made during the depression and we imagine the climate that they live in where work means keeping the farm no work  no farm  no homefor  dorothy was the perfect character for young girls she echoes many of the small town country girls who in the midst of the depression packed their suitcases and ran to hollywood seeking fame and fortune in the movies for them this film is a cautionary tale that theyd be better off if they just stayed home judy garland was perfect in the role  at the time but with wideeyes and a beautiful open face she carries that sense of wonderment of a child like most of us as children her only true companion is a dog named toto and the most frightening moment in the film is when she is nearly robbed of her best friend when she sings over the rainbow we know that its to escape an unhappy childhood she has apparently lost her parents and for garland we identify she began in show business as a kiddie act with her sisters and began her long movie career when she was only  she was already a familiar face from love finds andy hardy and by the time of oz she was already under contract to mgm that she was familiar to audiences helped her in the role that familiarity works well with her ability to project the vulnerability and melancholy that the character has to have we have to believe that she will become frightened and that her life will be in danger because if she doesnt that we sense that the character can work her way out of the situation herself and our interest wanesif movies are a time capsule than the wizard of oz wonderfully captures a brief moment of happiness in garlands life we know of her problems with studio execs that put her through an exhausting schedule and used drugs to get her going in the morning then put her to sleep at night we know the legends of her mental and physical problems that dogged her most of her life but the wizard of oz sees her at a moment in her life when it all seemed perfect just as her star was rising and before her problems really began theres poignancy in that and thats why i think that the casting of shirley temple in the role would have been a mistake by  temple was the biggest star in the world her presence in the film would have been too much she would have stood out and we would only seen shirley temple not dorothy galegarlands presence allows the story a certain credibility i have tried to imagine that famous dance down the yellow brick road with a  foot child and it just doesnt fitif garland gives the film its center than i think the production design aweinspiring in  is the perfect backdrop in these early musicals filmed on a soundstage it isnt hard to spot where the soundstage ends some have seen that as a flaw but i think it adds to the dreamlike quality of the film the matte paintings behind the sets add to the storybook quality the fact that were in a dream makes it okay that the special effects look a little hasty that was the genius of the screenplay that and to establish the oz characters as characters that dorothy meets in kansas in our dreams we often see people and events that have recently occurred in our lives but this is the first time ive ever seen it expressed in a movie in particular is the notion that professor marvel keeps showing up as various characters in the dreamwhat generosity the filmmakers had what ingenuity to create this entire world that is colorful and beautiful and scary what depth of character they created what messages they send this is a movie constructed with loving care were told that those who worked on the film just thought of this as just another movie but when i watch the film i find that hard to believe certainly from the screenwriters i wonder if they saw how brilliantly they were tapping our frustrations and our excitement our dreams our need and our sense of wonderment i wonder if they knew the impact of what they were working on that the lovely sentiments that they created would still resonate  years later i wonder if they knew that their hearts desires werent that far from our

"2177","the wizard of oz","a latecomer","dougdoepke","i have a theory that this movie has probably been seen by more people than any other movie the fact that it comes to us as children is probably the reason why other films like gone with the wind citizen kane the godfather star wars have been seen by a lot of people but in each case i can imagine people that might not have seen them in the case of the wizard of oz its hard to imagine anyone who might not have seen it at some point in their lives almost everyone you talk to has a memory of their first experience the reason this movie remains the most beloved of hollywood films even after six decades is because the wizard of oz is unique among motion pictures in that it mirrors our longings and imaginations as children the movie in front of and behind the scenes has become movie folklore we love the legends about the rotating directors from george cukor to king vidor to victor fleming we know the legend of buddy ebsen who had to drop out due to an allergic reaction to the tin man makeup and margaret hamilton whose dress caught fire and nearly had her face burned off because of the copperbased makeup we love stories about the problems on the set between personal feuds sweltering costumes partying munchkins and the costume designer who had to keep up with judy garlands developing bust line theres even a spurious legend of a ghost on the set all of these elements make the wizard of oz a much bigger legend than it already it but thats okay because this is the one movie that deserves to be overhyped it occupies such a large part of our memories that we want to make it more than it is to just have one more reason to make it more than a movie we want it to be a life experiencethat experience is brought to us because we are intimately familiar with its story elements the dreams that dorothy sings about and the adventure that follows seem to mirror our yearnings as children she imagines a bigger place where her problems dont linger and she is free to explore them she imagines a place where there isnt any trouble and people actually listen to what she has to say she sees the rainbow as her golden gate to a better place because in her drab kansas world the rainbow is the only source of color that she knows she dreams of a bigger place and imagines a world where troubles melt like lemondrops we can relate how many of us as kids sat in our room or in our yards and played imagining a place to go and characters to interact with a colorful world bigger than our small confined worlds oz is meant to represent the colorful palette of our imagination but for dorothy it is also a place where she does some growing up the three friends that she meets along the way the scarecrow the tin man and the lion are emblematic of the lessons of bravery love and devotion and the ability to think for ourselves the wicked witch of the west certainly represents the real dangers along the way for dorothy there is a matronly figure glinda the good witch who intends for dorothy to discover for herself how to solve her problems she knows that dorothy must grow up along the way in a way she seems to represent the parent that dorothy doesnt have back in kansas her aunt and uncle love her but this was a movie made during the depression and we imagine the climate that they live in where work means keeping the farm no work  no farm  no homefor  dorothy was the perfect character for young girls she echoes many of the small town country girls who in the midst of the depression packed their suitcases and ran to hollywood seeking fame and fortune in the movies for them this film is a cautionary tale that theyd be better off if they just stayed home judy garland was perfect in the role  at the time but with wideeyes and a beautiful open face she carries that sense of wonderment of a child like most of us as children her only true companion is a dog named toto and the most frightening moment in the film is when she is nearly robbed of her best friend when she sings over the rainbow we know that its to escape an unhappy childhood she has apparently lost her parents and for garland we identify she began in show business as a kiddie act with her sisters and began her long movie career when she was only  she was already a familiar face from love finds andy hardy and by the time of oz she was already under contract to mgm that she was familiar to audiences helped her in the role that familiarity works well with her ability to project the vulnerability and melancholy that the character has to have we have to believe that she will become frightened and that her life will be in danger because if she doesnt that we sense that the character can work her way out of the situation herself and our interest wanesif movies are a time capsule than the wizard of oz wonderfully captures a brief moment of happiness in garlands life we know of her problems with studio execs that put her through an exhausting schedule and used drugs to get her going in the morning then put her to sleep at night we know the legends of her mental and physical problems that dogged her most of her life but the wizard of oz sees her at a moment in her life when it all seemed perfect just as her star was rising and before her problems really began theres poignancy in that and thats why i think that the casting of shirley temple in the role would have been a mistake by  temple was the biggest star in the world her presence in the film would have been too much she would have stood out and we would only seen shirley temple not dorothy galegarlands presence allows the story a certain credibility i have tried to imagine that famous dance down the yellow brick road with a  foot child and it just doesnt fitif garland gives the film its center than i think the production design aweinspiring in  is the perfect backdrop in these early musicals filmed on a soundstage it isnt hard to spot where the soundstage ends some have seen that as a flaw but i think it adds to the dreamlike quality of the film the matte paintings behind the sets add to the storybook quality the fact that were in a dream makes it okay that the special effects look a little hasty that was the genius of the screenplay that and to establish the oz characters as characters that dorothy meets in kansas in our dreams we often see people and events that have recently occurred in our lives but this is the first time ive ever seen it expressed in a movie in particular is the notion that professor marvel keeps showing up as various characters in the dreamwhat generosity the filmmakers had what ingenuity to create this entire world that is colorful and beautiful and scary what depth of character they created what messages they send this is a movie constructed with loving care were told that those who worked on the film just thought of this as just another movie but when i watch the film i find that hard to believe certainly from the screenwriters i wonder if they saw how brilliantly they were tapping our frustrations and our excitement our dreams our need and our sense of wonderment i wonder if they knew the impact of what they were working on that the lovely sentiments that they created would still resonate  years later i wonder if they knew that their hearts desires werent that far from our own",2013-11-17,NA

"2187","the wizard of oz","a latecomer","dougdoepke","i have a theory that this movie has probably been seen by more people than any other movie the fact that it comes to us as children is probably the reason why other films like gone with the wind citizen kane the godfather star wars have been seen by a lot of people but in each case i can imagine people that might not have seen them in the case of the wizard of oz its hard to imagine anyone who might not have seen it at some point in their lives almost everyone you talk to has a memory of their first experience the reason this movie remains the most beloved of hollywood films even after six decades is because the wizard of oz is unique among motion pictures in that it mirrors our longings and imaginations as children the movie in front of and behind the scenes has become movie folklore we love the legends about the rotating directors from george cukor to king vidor to victor fleming we know the legend of buddy ebsen who had to drop out due to an allergic reaction to the tin man makeup and margaret hamilton whose dress caught fire and nearly had her face burned off because of the copperbased makeup we love stories about the problems on the set between personal feuds sweltering costumes partying munchkins and the costume designer who had to keep up with judy garlands developing bust line theres even a spurious legend of a ghost on the set all of these elements make the wizard of oz a much bigger legend than it already it but thats okay because this is the one movie that deserves to be overhyped it occupies such a large part of our memories that we want to make it more than it is to just have one more reason to make it more than a movie we want it to be a life experiencethat experience is brought to us because we are intimately familiar with its story elements the dreams that dorothy sings about and the adventure that follows seem to mirror our yearnings as children she imagines a bigger place where her problems dont linger and she is free to explore them she imagines a place where there isnt any trouble and people actually listen to what she has to say she sees the rainbow as her golden gate to a better place because in her drab kansas world the rainbow is the only source of color that she knows she dreams of a bigger place and imagines a world where troubles melt like lemondrops we can relate how many of us as kids sat in our room or in our yards and played imagining a place to go and characters to interact with a colorful world bigger than our small confined worlds oz is meant to represent the colorful palette of our imagination but for dorothy it is also a place where she does some growing up the three friends that she meets along the way the scarecrow the tin man and the lion are emblematic of the lessons of bravery love and devotion and the ability to think for ourselves the wicked witch of the west certainly represents the real dangers along the way for dorothy there is a matronly figure glinda the good witch who intends for dorothy to discover for herself how to solve her problems she knows that dorothy must grow up along the way in a way she seems to represent the parent that dorothy doesnt have back in kansas her aunt and uncle love her but this was a movie made during the depression and we imagine the climate that they live in where work means keeping the farm no work  no farm  no homefor  dorothy was the perfect character for young girls she echoes many of the small town country girls who in the midst of the depression packed their suitcases and ran to hollywood seeking fame and fortune in the movies for them this film is a cautionary tale that theyd be better off if they just stayed home judy garland was perfect in the role  at the time but with wideeyes and a beautiful open face she carries that sense of wonderment of a child like most of us as children her only true companion is a dog named toto and the most frightening moment in the film is when she is nearly robbed of her best friend when she sings over the rainbow we know that its to escape an unhappy childhood she has apparently lost her parents and for garland we identify she began in show business as a kiddie act with her sisters and began her long movie career when she was only  she was already a familiar face from love finds andy hardy and by the time of oz she was already under contract to mgm that she was familiar to audiences helped her in the role that familiarity works well with her ability to project the vulnerability and melancholy that the character has to have we have to believe that she will become frightened and that her life will be in danger because if she doesnt that we sense that the character can work her way out of the situation herself and our interest wanesif movies are a time capsule than the wizard of oz wonderfully captures a brief moment of happiness in garlands life we know of her problems with studio execs that put her through an exhausting schedule and used drugs to get her going in the morning then put her to sleep at night we know the legends of her mental and physical problems that dogged her most of her life but the wizard of oz sees her at a moment in her life when it all seemed perfect just as her star was rising and before her problems really began theres poignancy in that and thats why i think that the casting of shirley temple in the role would have been a mistake by  temple was the biggest star in the world her presence in the film would have been too much she would have stood out and we would only seen shirley temple not dorothy galegarlands presence allows the story a certain credibility i have tried to imagine that famous dance down the yellow brick road with a  foot child and it just doesnt fitif garland gives the film its center than i think the production design aweinspiring in  is the perfect backdrop in these early musicals filmed on a soundstage it isnt hard to spot where the soundstage ends some have seen that as a flaw but i think it adds to the dreamlike quality of the film the matte paintings behind the sets add to the storybook quality the fact that were in a dream makes it okay that the special effects look a little hasty that was the genius of the screenplay that and to establish the oz characters as characters that dorothy meets in kansas in our dreams we often see people and events that have recently occurred in our lives but this is the first time ive ever seen it expressed in a movie in particular is the notion that professor marvel keeps showing up as various characters in the dreamwhat generosity the filmmakers had what ingenuity to create this entire world that is colorful and beautiful and scary what depth of character they created what messages they send this is a movie constructed with loving care were told that those who worked on the film just thought of this as just another movie but when i watch the film i find that hard to believe certainly from the screenwriters i wonder if they saw how brilliantly they were tapping our frustrations and our excitement our dreams our need and our sense of wonderment i wonder if they knew the impact of what they were working on that the lovely sentiments that they created would still resonate  years later i wonder if they knew that their hearts desires werent that far from our
